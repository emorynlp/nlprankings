Abstract

Distributional methods have proven to ex-
cel at capturing fuzzy, graded aspects of
meaning (Italy is more similar to Spain
than to Germany). In contrast, it is diffi-
cult to extract the values of more specific
attributes of word referents from distribu-
tional representations, attributes of the kind
typically found in structured knowledge
bases (Italy has 60 million inhabitants). In
this paper, we pursue the hypothesis that
distributional vectors also implicitly en-
code referential attributes.

We show that a standard supervised regres-
sion model is in fact sufficient to retrieve
such attributes to a reasonable degree of ac-
curacy: When evaluated on the prediction
of both categorical and numeric attributes
of countries and cities, the model consis-
tently reduces baseline error by 30%, and is
not far from the upper bound. Further anal-
ysis suggests that our model is able to “ob-
jectify” distributional representations for
entities, anchoring them more firmly in the
external world in measurable ways.

1 Introduction

Distributional models induce vector-based seman-
tic representations of words from their contextual
distributions in corpora, exploiting the observation
that words with related meanings tend to occur
in similar linguistic contexts (Turney and Pantel,
2010; Erk, 2012). Since the approach only requires
raw text as input, it can be used to harvest word
representations on a very large scale. By encoding
the rich knowledge that is present in text, these
representations are able to capture many aspects
of word meaning. Moreover, approximating se-
mantic similarity by graded geometric distance in a
vector space is an effective strategy to address the

many linguistic phenomena that are better charac-
terized in gradient rather than discrete terms, such
as synonymy, selectional preferences, and semantic
priming (Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Erk et al., 2010;
Padó and Lapata, 2007, among others).

However, not all aspects of human semantic
knowledge are satisfactorily captured in terms of
fuzzy relations and graded similarity. In particular,
our knowledge of the meaning of words denoting
specific entities involves a number of “hard facts”
about the referents they denote that are best for-
malized as attribute-value pairs, of the sort that are
stored in manually-curated knowledge bases, such
as FreeBase or Wikidata.1 While distributional vec-
tors can capture the useful fact that, say, Italy is in
many ways more similar to Spain than to Germany,
as humans we also know (or we can easily look up)
a set of objective facts about Italy, such as what is
its capital, its area, its official language and GDP,
that are difficult to express in the language of vector
algebra and geometry.

In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that dis-
tributional vectors implicitly encode such attributes
of referential entities, which we will call referential
attributes. We show that a simple supervised algo-
rithm applied to vectors can retrieve them so that
they can be expressed in the explicit language of
structured knowledge bases. Concretely, we train
a logistic regression model to predict the values of
both numeric and categorical FreeBase attributes
of countries and cities from their distributional vec-
tors. This model makes predictions that are signifi-
cantly better than an informed baseline, in-between
the latter and an upper-bound method. Qualitative
analysis of the results points both to the inherent
difficulty of correctly retrieving certain classes of
attributes, and to some intriguing properties of the
conceptual nature of the knowledge encoded in dis-
tributional data, that bias their predictions about
certain objective attributes of geographic entities.

We see our experiment as a first step towards
integrating conceptual and referential aspects of
meaning in distributional semantics, as we further
discuss in the conclusion.

2 Method

2.1 Distributional Representations
Mikolov et al.’s (2013) skip-gram model is a
state-of-the-art “predictive” distributional seman-
tic model which represents each word in a space
of latent dimensions optimized to predict the con-
texts of the word’s occurrences. For our study,
we adopt the pre-trained 1,000-dimensional skip-
gram model for Named Entities that is available
at https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
and was produced from a 100-billion token news
corpus. We refer to this model as WORD2VEC.

2.2 Referential Representations
As our source of referential attributes, we use Free-
Base (see footnote 1), a knowledge base of struc-
tured information on a wide range of entities of
different semantic types (people, geographical enti-
ties, etc.). The information in FreeBase comes from
various sources, including Wikipedia and domain-
specific databases, plus user content generation and
correction. FreeBase currently records at least 2
attributes for over 47 million entities, and it has
been used fairly extensively in NLP before (Mintz
et al., 2009; Socher et al., 2013a, among others).

For each entity, FreeBase contains a list of at-
tribute-value tuples (where values can in turn be
entities, allowing a graph view of the data that
we do not exploit here). Table 1 shows a sample
of the attributes that FreeBase records for coun-
tries. Note that some attributes are simple (e.g.,
date founded), while other can be called com-
plex, in the sense that they are attributes of at-
tributes (e.g., geolocation::latitude). We
use a double-colon notation to refer to complex
attributes. The values of all attributes can be either
numeric or categorical. The numeric attributes in
particular are often strongly correlated, both within
attributes types across years (e.g., fertility rate in
different years) and across attributes within years
(e.g., absolute GDP and GDP per capita in a given
year).

We built two datasets for our experiments, one
for countries and one for cities, with data automati-
cally extracted from FreeBase.2 We consider two

2Both datasets are publicly available at http:

datasets in order to check that the mapping we seek
can be established not just for one, possible hand-
picked, type of entities; we leave it to future work
to study very different kinds of entities, such as
people or institutions.

The Countries dataset consists of the 260
countries for which we have a distributional
vector. Some countries do not exist anymore,
like Yugoslavia, but, since this does not impact
our method, we keep them in the dataset. The
dataset records all simple attributes as well as
complex attributes of at most two hops in the
FreeBase graph, without manual inspection. We
linearly rescale all numeric attributes to [0..1] and
translate all categorical attributes into a binary
representation by suffixing the original value to
the original attribute name. For example, the
attribute member-of::organization with the
value world bank results in a binary attribute
member-of::organization::world bank

having value 1 for all and only those countries
that are members of the World Bank, 0 for the
others.3 Attributes that occur less than 15 times
are discarded, since they are either not consistently
recorded or rare. This results in a total of 707
numeric and 247 binary attributes. Finally, we
partition the data into training, validation, and test
set, using a 60-20-20 percent split.

We apply the same process to the Cities dataset,
which consists of 1645 cities from the intersection
of the distributional and FreeBase city lists. In

//www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/
ressourcen/korpora/CityCountry.html.

3We considered treating some categorical attributes as
multi-valued, but decided against it since the cases in which al-
ternative values are mutually exclusive are rare (e.g., the same
country can be containedBy multiple entities, cf. Table 1).

13



this case, we have 211 numeric and 106 binary
attributes – the numbers are smaller because coun-
tries have a richer representation in FreeBase than
cities.

2.3 Attribute Prediction
We do zero-shot learning of full FreeBase attribute-
based country/city representations, based on distri-
butional (WORD2VEC) representations. It is zero-
shot learning in the sense of Palatucci et al. (2009):
We split the datasets at the entity, rather than at-
tribute level, such that at test time our system must
predict the full attribute set of countries and cities
that were not seen during training at all.

We use logistic regression. In effect, we predict
each output variable (FreeBase attribute) with an in-
dependent logistic regression model based on a con-
stant set of input features (WORD2VEC distribu-
tional dimensions). We call this model DIST2REF.
DIST2REF does not take advantage of the corre-
lations between the output attributes mentioned in
Section 2.2.

The dependent variables are binary as well as nu-
meric FreeBase attributes, and our model does not
distinguish between them. For binary attributes,
we interpret the value returned by the model as
the probability of “success” of a binary Bernoulli
trial. In the numeric case, we view the probabil-
ity returned by the model as directly representing
normalized attribute values.

2.4 Experimental Setup
We design the model using the Countries dataset,
and apply it to Cities without further tuning to test
its robustness. We optimize the parameters with
gradient descent, using the Cross Entropy error
function. We considered L2 regularization to ad-
dress possible overfitting, but experiments on val-
idation set showed that the model performs best
without any regularization.

As for baselines, for binary features we predict
the majority class (0 or 1), and for numeric features
we predict the mean value of the feature in the
training set. These are of course strong baselines
to beat.

As an upper bound, we train a model that uses
the same architecture as described above but uses
as input not distributional vectors but the FreeBase
attributes themselves. In other words, this model
has to learn “only” an identity mapping. This is not
trivial, though, for example due to the presence of
strong correlations among attributes, in particular

the time series attributes (cf. Section 2.2). We call
this model REF2REF.

2.5 Evaluation

Since there is no appropriate unified evaluation
measure that covers both numeric and binary at-
tributes, we evaluate them separately. For binary
attributes, we report the attributes’ mean accuracy.

For numeric attributes, we consider attribute
prediction a ranking task. As an example, take
the population::2011::number attribute, and
imagine that we only have three countries (Ger-
many: 80M; Spain: 36M; and Netherlands: 17M).
If we predict 56M for Spain’s population, it is still
(correctly) predicted as the second most populous
country (rank difference of 0); a prediction of 16M,
however, would push Spain to third place (rank
difference of 1).

This suggests the use of rank correlation coef-
ficients like Spearman’s ρ. However, we want to
measure not only how well the model can rank the
countries in the test set, but also whether these pre-
dictions are consistent with the training set (which
makes evaluation both more challenging and more
realistic). One way of achieving this goal would be
to use ρ on the union of training and test instances,
but this could lead to misleadingly high correlation
coefficients since this method would include the
labels of the training instances in the evaluation.

Consequently, we define our own evaluation
measure, following a rationale similar to Frome et
al.’s (2013) evaluation of a zero-shot learning sce-
nario. What we evaluate, for each attribute, is the
rank of the test countries in the whole country list.
Note that this makes our task harder, as there are
more confounders: If we only evaluated on the test
set, there would be shorter lists and therefore less
chances of getting bad rankings. So, concretely, we
first define the prediction quality of each attribute,
Q(a), as the median of the rank difference between
the prediction and the gold standard in a list that
includes both training and test countries (we use
the median to give less weight to outlier countries).
We also normalize the rank difference to obtain a
number between zero and one. In a second step,
we define the quality of the complete model, the
normalized rank score (NRS), as the mean of all
attribute quality scores, in parallel to our evaluation
on binary attributes.

Let the set of instances I be partitioned into train-
ing instances Tr and test instances Ts. Let a ∈ A

denote an attribute. We write pa(i) for the pre-
dicted value of attribute a for instance i and ga(i)
for the gold standard value. Finally, let r(v, S) de-
note the rank of value v in the list resulting when
ordering the set S. Now we can define:

Q(a) =
1
||I||med{|r(pa(i), I) − (1)

r(ga(i), I)| − 1 | i ∈ Ts}
NRS =

||A||

∑
a∈A

Q(a) (2)

This measure can be interpreted similarly to Mean
Reciprocal Rank (Manning et al., 2008): It has
range [0..1], with smaller numbers indicating better
ranking: 0.1, for example, means that, on average,
the prediction is 10% of the ranks off (e.g., by four
countries in a forty-country list).4

Note that, when evaluating each instance i, we
use gold-standard values for all other instances, so
that there the baseline is not hampered by ties.

3 Results

Table 2 shows the results of our experiments on the
two test sets. For accuracy 1 is best, but for NRS
0 is best. Recall from Section 2.2 that we perform
model selection on the Countries dataset only.

The baseline is relatively high, in particular for
the binary attributes, many of which are positive
for a small subset of entities only. The amount of
skew differs considerably between the two datasets,
though. For Countries, the baseline yields an ac-
curacy of 0.86, but it achieves 0.97 on Cities. The
increase stems from very sparse categorical City
features such as containedBy, which includes all

dicted and gold value of an attribute are adjacent in the rank-
ing, their rank difference is 0, capturing the intuition of rank
difference as counting the number of falsely intervening items.

levels of administrative divisions – that is, for the
US, all counties appear as values and are trans-
formed into sparse binary features (cf. Section 2.2).
Of course, the predictions of the baseline are use-
less, since it always predicts the absence of any
features. On numeric features, where the baseline
predicts the mean, its performance is 0.35 NRS on
both datasets. In other words, its average prediction
is off by about one third the length of the ranked
list for each attribute.

Recall that the upper bound model, REF2REF,
uses FreeBase attributes to predict FreeBase at-
tributes. All it has to learn is that there is one
feature in the input that corresponds ideally to the
output. This works almost perfectly for binary at-
tributes, with accuracy values of 0.96 (Countries)
and 1.00 (Cities). However, its performance on
numeric features (with NRS at 0.14 and 0.21, re-
spectively) is not quite perfect. We attribute this to
the presence of correlations (cf. Section 2.2).

The model whose performance we are actually
interested in, DIST2REF, in which we map from
distributional information to FreeBase features, per-
forms with remarkable consistency between these
two extremes. In fact, we see a consistent error
reduction of around 30% over the baseline, with
a similar distance to the upper bound. A signifi-
cance test with bootstrap resampling (Efron and
Tibshirani, 1994) showed that all pairwise com-
parisons (Baseline vs. DIST2REF, DIST2REF vs.
REF2REF) are statistically significant at p<0.001.

To rule out that we misinterpret our accuracy-
based evaluation for the binary features in the
face of a highly skewed class distribution, we also
computed precision, recall, and F-Score values.
The relative patterns match those of the accuracy-
based evaluation well (Countries: baseline F=0.13,
DIST2REF F=0.51, REF2REF F=0.77) and indicate
that generally precision is higher than recall.

We think that these are overall promising results,
given that the FreeBase attributes we predict are
fairly fine-grained, and we only use generic distri-
butional information as input.

4 Analysis

We take the overall results just presented to suggest
that we are able to learn referential attributes from
distributional information to a large extent. In this
section we take a closer look at what kind of in-
formation we are able to learn, what is beyond the
scope of our model, and what are the differences
between the entity representations in WORD2VEC
and the ones our model produces. All the data
concerns the test sets only.

4.1 Attribute Groups

We start with a qualitative analysis of the Countries
dataset. Due to the large number of attributes, we
sort all individual attributes into attribute groups
by their base name (i.e. the leftmost component
of their name, cf. Section 2.2), which offers an
accessible level of granularity for inspection. We
obtain 34 numeric and 40 binary attribute groups
with median sizes of 8.5 and 2 attributes per group,
respectively.

Table 3 shows the attribute groups for both types
sorted by quality. For each group, we report av-
erage normalized rank score (NRS) and accuracy,
respectively, for both DIST2REF and the baseline.

The analysis suggests that there are two main
factors that account for the results: (1) The degree
to which an attribute is contextually supported, that
is, to what extent its values can be identified on the
basis of the contextual information that is captured
in a distributional model, and (2) general proper-
ties of the data that affect Machine Learning, most
notably data sparseness, possibly also feature value
distributions.

Attributes that are contextually supported in-
clude for instance those related to socioeconomic
development (see below for details); people talk
(and so write) about countries being more or less
developed, rich, having one or another kind of laws,
and this is captured in the abstractions over textual
context that distributional models perform. As an
extreme example of an attribute that is not contex-
tually supported, consider the numeric ISO code
of a country (iso numeric), whose values are ar-
bitrary: They do not correspond to facts about the
world that are reflected in the way people use lan-

guage, and so can’t be picked up by the distribu-
tional model. For this reason, DIST2REF does
worse than the baseline.

Note that, in a sufficiently large corpus, we might
indeed encounter statements like The numeric ISO
code for Spain is 724. However, since distributional
models represent words as aggregated distributions
of their contexts, and compute semantic similarity
from these context distributions, the contexts that
they use need to be generic enough to yield mean-
ingful overlap between concepts (e.g., words). As a
result, distributional models cannot easily represent
knowledge of the form “the value for property Y
of word/concept X is Z”.

Fortunately, we find that many FreeBase at-
tributes are contextually supported to a substantial
degree, even some seemingly arbitrary ones. An ex-
ample is calling codes, which we predict very well.
They turn out to be correlated with geolocations:
2X calling codes are located in Africa, 3X call-
ing codes in Southern and Eastern Europe and 4X
calling codes in Western and Northern Europe (for
comparison, ISO codes are assigned in a roughly
alphabetical order).

Numeric Attributes. Our best numeric at-
tributes belong to the geolocation group (lati-
tude and longitude). We provide a more detailed
analysis of these attributes below (Section 4.2). As
mentioned above, we also excel at many attributes
related to a country’s economic and social devel-
opment (broadly construed), such as GNI, GDP,
CO2 emissions, internet usage (each per capita),
or fertility rate. These attributes can be expected
to be contextually grounded – e.g., Luxembourg
will occur with contexts like “broadband” or “rich”
more than India.

Note, however, that the information contained in
the vectors is surprisingly subtle: For instance, the
fertility rate is a function of both general develop-
ment status (lower rates in more developed coun-
tries) and of specific social factors (higher rates in
countries with more support for families, such as
France and Finland compared countries with less
support, such as Germany or Italy).

Around the middle of the table, we find the ab-
solute versions of the developmental cluster above
(GNI in $, real and nominal GDP). Evidently, the
absolute versions of these attributes are substan-
tially less contextually supported than the relative
versions. This is not surprising: While India and
China have high absolute GDPs because they are

large countries, and for instance Luxembourg has
a much smaller one, these numbers are not indica-
tive of the actual conditions in these countries, and
therefore also not so clearly correlated with what
people write about them. This provides another
interesting angle on the difference between distri-
butional and formal knowledge representation. In
a formal system, absolute GDP, relative GDP, and
population stand in a fixed linear relationship and
knowing any two of the three uniquely determines
the third – thus, all three attributes have equal status.
In our distributional space, their status is clearly

different, determined by the conceptual relevance
of the different attributes.

Towards the end of the table, we find more
attributes related to socioeconomic develop-
ment, such as government percent debt and
minimum wage. While these should be contextu-
ally supported, too, the problem here is factor (2)
mentioned above, namely severe data sparsity (see
column f(A) in Table 3, which lists the median
number of datapoints that exhibit each attribute
group). The same goes for the remaining attribute
groups, for instance casualties (describing the

17



total number of military casualties incurred in his-
tory), date founded and date dissolved,5 or
climate avg rainfall.

Binary Attributes. The binary attributes show
a similar picture, albeit somewhat less sharp. We
again find contextually unsupported groups, many
of them arising from our fully automatic attribute
mining from FreeBase (cf. Section 2.2). There
are many categorical attributes that store meta-
data about numeric attributes (such as the cur-
rency in the gdp and gni groups) as well as
meta-information of FreeBase: exceptions is
a specific marker of potentially inconsistent en-
tries about Ghana, and equivalent instances
is a flag concerning links between FreeBase and
OpenCyc. Fortunately, almost all contextually un-
supported groups are small, with only one or two
attributes, and do not have a large impact on the
overall performance. We decided not to exclude
them from evaluation for robustness’ sake, since
there is no automatic way to identify contextually
unsupported attributes in a new dataset.

We obtain good results on meaningful attributes
that are arguably strongly contextually grounded,
such as geographical and geopolitical attributes
(member of: membership in international organi-
zations; location on a continent, etc.). However,
we fare relatively badly on government-related
attributes (form of government, governing offi-
cials). While this seems surprising at first glance,
the form of government attribute in FreeBase
makes very fine-grained distinctions: Its values
include “unitary state”, “presidential system”, “par-
liamentary system” and “republic”, which are not
mutually exclusive, and misses obvious alternatives
like “authoritarian system”. It is not surprising
that distributional models cannot make such sub-
tle distinction between presidential and parliamen-
tary systems. The attribute governing official
presents a similar case. Other bad attributes are
very domain-specific, including athletes, encod-
ing the athletic disciplines that countries participate
in (such as swimming, judo, running, etc.), and the
data sparsity issue is certainly worse for the binary
attributes.

5Note that date-based attributes can be contextually sup-
ported: We do better on national anthem since, for
which we have more datapoints, 97.

predicted vs. ground truth distances between coun-
tries and cities in the test sets. WORD2VEC corre-
lations are negative because we use cosines.

4.2 Geolocation
To analyze the difference between the distributional
representations and the output of our model, we
focus on geolocation, our best attribute group.

It has already been shown that geometric dis-
tance in distributional space captures, to a cer-
tain extent, physical distance between locations
in the real world (Louwerse and Zwaan, 2009). Ta-
ble 4 shows that DIST2REF extracts even more pre-
cise distance information from distributional vec-
tors. The table reports the correlation between real
and model-predicted distances for countries and
cities. Ground-truth great circle distances (Kern
and Bland, 1948) between items are computed us-
ing the FreeBase longitude and latitude values; for
DIST2REF we use its predicted latitude and longi-
tude values; for WORD2VEC, the cosines between
the corresponding distributional vectors.

We obtain highly significant correlations in all
cases (p<10−14), but much higher for DIST2REF.
For countries, as shown in Table 4, the correlation
is -0.36 for WORD2VEC (negative, because cosine
is a similarity measure), 0.49 for DIST2REF. For
cities, WORD2VEC reaches -0.45 correlation, and
DIST2REF distances are at 0.88, showing that the
method can estimate city positions to a perhaps
unexpectedly high degree of accuracy.6

This result suggests that we manage to objec-
tify the information in the distributional model,
anchoring the entities more firmly in the external
world. Indeed, distributional models are known to
be subject to conceptual or cultural effects in their
distance estimations. For instance, in WORD2VEC
German and Spanish cities are much farther away
than in the physical world, while cities within Spain
and within Germany are predicted to be a bit closer
than they actually are. Note that these effects have

6The results are confirmed when the analysis is repeated
using the Spearman correlation measure: The DIST2REF co-
efficients are stable, whereas those of WORD2VEC go down
to 0.22 (countries) and 0.40 (cities), respectively. The good
results for Spearman, as a rank-based measure, indicate that
our success is not dominated by outliers.

an actual cognitive basis: Human intuitions about
objective physical distance between countries and
cities are biased by cognitive, cultural and socio-
economic factors, as explored for example in Fried-
man et al. (2002), who report that Texans locate
Canadian cities closer to the US border relative to
Mexican cities, despite their proximity to the latter,
and that they place Southern US cities further south
than they really are.

Interestingly, DIST2REF does also show some
cultural effects in its geolocation errors: For exam-
ple, some Pacific island states with lesser-known
identities (e.g., Nauru and French Polynesia) are
placed in the Indian Ocean, where we find the per-
haps prototypes of beautiful islands, like Seychelles
and Mauritius; also, Central American countries
(such as Panama, El Salvador, and Nicaragua)
move towards their “cultural center of gravity”,
South America.

However, this kind of cultural bias is much more
prominent in the original WORD2VEC distribu-
tional representation. The Spain/Germany effect
discussed above is not found in the DIST2REF
model at all. And while both DIST2REF and
WORD2VEC place Mexican and Spanish cities in
our test set closer to each other than they actually
are, WORD2VEC does so to a much larger extent.
In line with our goal to extract referential attributes,
thus, we are satisfied to see that DIST2REF man-
ages to minimize this bias and distill the referential
part from the distributional representations.

5 Related Work

There is a large literature on exploiting corpus ev-
idence, sometimes through distributional seman-
tic methods, in order to construct and populate
structured knowledge bases (KBs) (e.g., Buitelaar
and Cimiano (2008) and references therein). This
line of work, however, does not attempt to con-
nect entity representations extracted from corpora
and from KBs, as we do. Moreover, it focuses on
harvesting relations between entities or between
entities and a limited number of discrete attributes,
rather than predicting full-fledged KB representa-
tions of specific entities, like we do. Freitas and
Curry (2014) and Freitas et al. (2014) embed rela-
tional graphs from KBs in a distributional semantic
space to support various forms of search and rea-
soning about the KB. The focus is again on rela-
tions between discrete entities, and on exploiting
distributional semantics to navigate among them.

Socher et al. (2013a) represent WordNet and
FreeBase entities with corpus-based distributional
vectors. They train a tensor for each relation of
interest to return high scores when combined with
the vectors of two entities that hold the intended
relation. At test time, the system is used to classify
relational tuples as true or false, as well as to predict
new entities that hold a certain relationship with a
target entity. This is quite close in spirit to what we
do, except that, given an entity1-relation-entity2
tuple, we treat relation-entity2 as a binary attribute
of entity1, and we try to induce such attributes on a
larger scale (Socher et al. consider seven relations
in total). Moreover, we rely on the same architec-
ture to learn discrete features denoting relations
with entities and numerical features, to induce full
attribute-based descriptions of entities.

Our proposal is only distantly related to methods
to embed words tokens and KB entities and rela-
tionships in a vector space, e.g., for better relation
extraction (see Weston et al. (2013) and references
therein). This line of work does not use distribu-
tional semantics to induce word vectors, and ig-
nores numerical attributes.

The broader goal of getting at referential infor-
mation with distributional semantics is shared with
Herbelot (2015). However, the specific approach
is different, as she constructs vectors for individ-
ual entities (literary characters) by contextualizing
generic noun vectors with distributional properties
of those entities. Finally, we share our methodol-
ogy with work on mapping between corpus-based
word representations and other representational
spaces, such as subject-generated concept prop-
erties (Johns and Jones, 2012; Hill et al., 2014;
Făgărăşan et al., 2015), visual features (Frome et
al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013b; Lazaridou et al.,
2014) or brain signals (Mitchell et al., 2008; Mur-
phy et al., 2012). In all these settings, the focus is
entirely on predicting numerical attributes, whereas
we treat both numerical and binary attributes. Ru-
binstein et al. (2015) use distributional vectors to
predict binary conceptual attributes of common
nouns, as well as a continuous score measuring
saliency of such attributes. Our target features are
conceptually very different from those of all these
studies.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

We have shown that a simple model can learn to
predict, to a reasonable degree of accuracy, ref-

19



erential attributes of an entity that are typically
seen in a knowledge base from the corresponding
corpus-based distributional representation. The re-
sults suggest that, while distributional semantic
vectors can be used “as-is” to capture generic word
similarity, with some supervision it is also pos-
sible to extract other kinds of information from
them, including structured factual statements of the
sort encoded in manually-curated knowledge bases.
This makes distributional vectors very attractive as
general-purpose word meaning representations.

We have also shown that some of the errors in the
predictions can be explained on cultural grounds,
but that these effects are more pronounced in the
input of our model, a standard distributional se-
mantic model, than in its output. In this sense, our
model manages to objectify the information that it
is provided with. Our analyses also suggest that
the main limiting factor in learning referential at-
tributes, apart from good old data sparseness, is the
degree to which they are contextually supported,
that is, to what extent they are expressed with con-
sistent and specific linguistic means in the context
of their target words. This determines whether they
are actually represented in the distributional model
in the first place.

More generally, we see our work as a small
step towards the more general goal of bridging the
concept-referent gap in distributional semantics.
A common noun such as dog denotes a concept,
based on a prototype with fuzzy boundaries, sus-
ceptible of metaphorical extensions, and bearing all
the other hallmarks of generic conceptual knowl-
edge (Carlson, 2009; Murphy, 2002). These might
be adequately captured by the properties of the dog
vector in distributional semantic space. However,
when used in a specific discourse, words and more
complex linguistic expressions often denote spe-
cific referents with fixed, “hard” properties, such
as this dog, or Amur, when used for my neighbor’s
dog at 3.31pm on May 29th 2015 in Novosibirsk, a
61cm-tall black-and-tan foxhound. Amur is more
easily characterized by a set of precise attribute-
value pairs than by a vector in a generic concep-
tual space. Our experiment suggests that distri-
butional vectors encode both generic conceptual
knowledge and more precise attributes of specific
referents. Of course, while we can use FreeBase
and other knowledge bases to gather training data
about public-domain entities, such as countries or
cities, it is still not clear where we could gather

appropriate training data to learn about the specific
properties of “private-discourse” referents such as
Amur. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether
the properties of common named entities, such as
countries and cities, that are in a sense “hybrid” be-
tween the conceptual and referential domains, also
transfer to entities of a more specific and private
kind. Finally, it is still not clear how to extend
the current approach beyond words and phrases
directly denoting an entity (Amur) to other kinds
of definite descriptions (this dog).
