Abstract

Importance weighting is a generalization
of various statistical bias correction tech-
niques. While our labeled data in NLP is
heavily biased, importance weighting has
seen only few applications in NLP, most of
them relying on a small amount of labeled
target data. The publication bias toward
reporting positive results makes it hard to
say whether researchers have tried. This
paper presents a negative result on unsu-
pervised domain adaptation for POS tag-
ging. In this setup, we only have unlabeled
data and thus only indirect access to the
bias in emission and transition probabili-
ties. Moreover, most errors in POS tag-
ging are due to unseen words, and there,
importance weighting cannot help. We
present experiments with a wide variety of
weight functions, quantilizations, as well
as with randomly generated weights, to
support these claims.

1 Introduction

Many NLP tasks rely on the availability of anno-
tated data. The majority of annotated data, how-
ever, is sampled from newswire corpora. The
performance of NLP systems, e.g., part-of-speech
(POS) tagger, parsers, relation extraction sys-
tems, etc., drops significantly when they are ap-
plied to data that departs from newswire conven-
tions. So while we can extract information, trans-
late and summarize newswire in major languages
with some success, we are much less successful
processing microblogs, chat, weblogs, answers,
emails or literature in a robust way. The main rea-
sons for the drops in accuracy have been attributed
to factors such as previously unseen words and bi-
grams, missing punctuation and capitalization, as
well as differences in the marginal distribution of

data (Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2008;
Søgaard and Haulrich, 2011).

The move from one domain to another (from a
source to a new target domain), say from newspa-
per articles to weblogs, results in a sample selec-
tion bias. Our training data is now biased, since
it is sampled from a related, but nevertheless dif-
ferent distribution. The problem of automatically
adjusting the model induced from source to a dif-
ferent target is referred to as domain adaptation.

Some researchers have studied domain adap-
tation scenarios, where small samples of labeled
data have been assumed to be available for the
target domains. This is usually an unrealistic as-
sumption, since even for major languages, small
samples are only available from a limited number
of domains, and in this work we focus on unsuper-
vised domain adaptation, assuming only unlabeled
target data is available.

Jiang and Zhai (2007), Foster et al. (2010; Plank
and Moschitti (2013) and Søgaard and Haulrich
(2011) have previously tried to use importance
weighting to correct sample bias in NLP. Im-
portance weighting means assigning a weight
to each training instance, reflecting its impor-
tance for modeling the target distribution. Im-
portance weighting is a generalization over post-
stratification (Smith, 1991) and importance sam-
pling (Smith et al., 1997) and can be used to cor-
rect bias in the labeled data.

Out of the four papers mentioned, only Søgaard
and Haulrich (2011) and Plank and Moschitti
(2013) considered an unsupervised domain adap-
tation scenario, obtaining mixed results. These
two papers assume covariate shift (Shimodaira,
2000), i.e., that there is only a bias in the marginal
distribution of the training data. Under this as-
sumption, we can correct the bias by applying a
weight function Pt(x)Ps(x) to our training data points
(labeled sentences) and learn from the weighted
data. Of course this weight function cannot be

968



computed in general, but we can approximate it
in different ways.

In POS tagging, we typically factorize se-
quences into emission and transition probabilities.
Importance weighting can change emission prob-
abilities and transition probabilities by assigning
weights to sentences. For instance, if our corpus
consisted of three sequences: 1) a/A b/A, 2) a/A
b/B, and 3) a/A b/B, then P (B|A) = 2/3. If se-
quences two and three were down-weighted to 0.5,
then P (B|A) = 1/2.

However, this paper argues that importance
weighting cannot help adapting POS taggers to
new domains using only unlabeled target data. We
present three sources of evidence: (a) negative
results with the most obvious weight functions
across various English datasets, (b) negative re-
sults with randomly sampled weights, as well as
(c) an analysis of annotated data indicating that
there is little variation in emission and transition
probabilities across the various domains.

2 Related work

Most prior work on importance weighting use a
domain classifier, i.e., train a classifier to discrimi-
nate between source and target instances (Søgaard
and Haulrich, 2011; Plank and Moschitti, 2013)
(y ∈ {s, t}). For instance, Søgaard and Haulrich
(2011) train a n-gram text classifier and Plank
and Moschitti (2013) a tree-kernel based clas-
sifier on relation extraction instances. In these
studies, P̂ (t|x) is used as an approximation of
Pt(x)
Ps(x)

, following Zadrozny (2004). In §3, we fol-
low the approach of Søgaard and Haulrich (2011),
but consider a wider range of weight functions.
Others have proposed to use kernel mean match-
ing (Huang et al., 2007) or minimizing KL-
divergence (Sugiyama et al., 2007).

Jiang and Zhai (2007) use importance weight-
ing to select a subsample of the source data by
subsequently setting the weight of all selected data
points to 1, and 0 otherwise. However, they do
so by relying on a sequential model trained on
labeled target data. Our results indicate that the
covariate shift assumption fails to hold for cross-
domain POS tagging. While the marginal distri-
butions obviously do differ (since we can tell do-
mains apart without POS analysis), this is most
likely not the only difference. This might explain
the positive results obtained by Jiang and Zhai
(2007). We will come back to this in §4.

Cortes et al. (2010) show that importance
weighting potentially leads to over-fitting, but pro-
pose to use quantiles to obtain more robust weight
functions. The idea is to rank all weights and ob-
tain q quantiles. If a data point x is weighted by
w, and w lies in the ith quantile of the ranking
(i ≤ q), x is weighted by the average weight of
data points in the ith quantile.

The weighted structured perceptron (§3) used in
the experiments below was recently used for a dif-
ferent problem, namely for correcting for bias in
annotations (Plank et al., 2014).

3 Experiments

3.1 Data
We use the data made available in the SANCL
2012 Shared Task (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).
The training data is the OntoNotes 4.0 release
of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn
Treebank, while the target domain evaluation data
comes from various sources, incl. Yahoo Answers,
user reviews, emails, weblogs and newsgroups.
For each target domain, we have both development
and test data.

3.2 Model
In the weighted perceptron (Cavallanti et al.,
2006), we make the learning rate dependent on the
current instance xn, using the following update:

wi+1 ← wi + βnα(yn − sign(wi · xn))xn (1)
where βn is the weight associated with xn. See

Huang et al. (2007) for similar notation.
We extend this idea straightforwardly to the

structured perceptron (Collins, 2002), for which

we use an in-house implementation. We use
commonly used features, i.e., w,w−1, w−2,
w+1, w+2, digit, hyphen, capitalization, pre-
/suffix features, and Brown word clusters. The
model seems robust with respect to number
of training epochs, cf. Figure 1. Therefore
we fix the number of epochs to five and use
this setting in all our experiments. Our code
is available at: https://bitbucket.org/
bplank/importance-weighting-exp.

3.3 Importance weighting

In our first set of experiments, we follow Søgaard
and Haulrich (2011) in using document classifiers
to obtain weights for the source instances. We
train a text classifier that discriminates the two
domains (source and target). For each sentence
in the source and target domain (the unlabeled
text that comes with the SANCL data), we mark
whether it comes from the source or target do-
main and train a binary classifier (logistic regres-
sion) to discriminate between the two. For ev-
ery sentence in the source we obtain its probabil-
ity for the target domain by doing 5-fold cross-
validation. While Søgaard and Haulrich (2011)
use only token-based features (word n-grams ≤
3), we here exploit a variety of features: word
token n-grams, and two generalizations: using
Brown clusters (estimated from the union of the
5 target domains), and Wiktionary tags (if a word
has multiple tags, we assign it the union of tags as
single tag; OOV words are marked as such).

The distributions of weights can be seen in the
upper half of Figure 2.

3.3.1 Results
Table 1 shows that our baseline model achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to
SANCL (Petrov and McDonald, 2012)1 and
FLORS (Schnabel and Schütze, 2014). Our
results align well with the second best POS
tagger in the SANCL 2012 Shared Task. Note

that the best tagger in the shared task explicitly
used normalization and various other heuristics
to achieve better performance. In the rest of the
paper, we use the universal tag set part of the
SANCL data (Petrov et al., 2012).

Figure 3 presents our results on development
data for different importance weighting setups.
None of the above weight functions lead to signifi-
cant improvements on any of the datasets. We also
tried scaling and binning the weights, as suggested
by Cortes et al. (2010), but results kept fluctuating
around baseline performance, with no significant
improvements.

3.4 Random weighting

Obviously, weight functions based on document
classifiers may simply not characterize the rele-
vant properties of the instances and hence lead to
bad re-weighting of the data. We consider three
random sampling strategies, namely sampling ran-
dom uniforms, random exponentials, and random

970



Figure 3: Results on development data for different weight functions, i.e., document classifiers trained
on a) raw tokens; b) tokens replaced by Wiktionary tags; c) tokens replaced by Brown cluster ids. The
weight was the raw pt(y|x) value, no scaling, no quantiles. Replacing only open-class tokens for b) and
c) gave similar or lower performance.

Zipfians and ran 500 samples for each. For these
experiments, we estimate significance cut-off lev-
els of tagging accuracies using the approximate
randomization test. To find the cut-off levels,
we randomly replace labels with gold labels until
the achieved accuracy significantly improves over
the baseline for more than 50% of the samples.
For each accuracy level, 50 random samples were
taken.

Figure 4: Random weight functions (500 runs
each) on test sets. Solid line is the baseline per-
formance, while the dashed line is the p-value cut-
off. From top: random, exponential and Zipfian
weighting. All runs fall below the cut-off.

3.4.1 Results
The dashed lines in Figure 4 show the p-value cut-
offs for positive results. We see that most random
weightings of data lead to slight drops in perfor-
mance or are around baseline performance, and no
weightings lead to significant improvements. Ran-
dom uniforms seem slightly better than exponen-
tials and Zipfians.

Table 2: Relevant statistics for our analysis (§4)
on the test sets: average tag ambiguity, out-of-
vocabulary rate, and KL-divergence and Pearson
correlation coefficient (ρ) on POS bigrams.

4 Analysis

Some differences between the gold-annotated
source domain data and the gold-annotated tar-
get data used for evaluation are presented in Ta-
ble 2. One important observation is the low ambi-
guity of word forms in the data. This makes the
room for improvement with importance weight-
ing smaller. Moreover, the KL divergencies over
POS bigrams are also very low. This tells us that
transition probabilities are also relatively constant
across domains, again suggesting limited room for
improvement for importance weighting.

Compared to this, we see much bigger differ-
ences in OOV rates. OOV rates do seem to explain
most of the performance drop across domains.
In order to verify this, we implemented a ver-
sion of our structured perceptron tagger with type-
constrained inference (Täckström et al., 2013).
This technique only improves performance on un-
seen words, but nevertheless we saw significant
improvements across all five domains (cf. Ta-
ble 3). This suggests that unseen words are a
more important problem than the marginal distri-
bution of data for unsupervised domain adaptation
of POS taggers.

We also tried Jiang and Zhai’s subset selection
technique (§3.1 in Jiang and Zhai (2007)), which
assumes labeled training material for the target
domain. However, we did not see any improve-
ments. A possible explanation for these different
findings might be the following. Jiang and Zhai
(2007) use labeled target data to learn their weight-
ing model, i.e., in a supervised domain adaptation
scenario. This potentially leads to very different
weight functions. For example, let the source do-
main be 100 instances of a/A b/B and 100 in-
stances of b/B b/B, and the target domain be 100
instances of a/B a/B. Note that a domain classi-
fier would favor the first 100 sentences, but in an
HMM model induced from the labeled target data,
things look very different. If we apply Laplace
smoothing, the probability of a/A b/B accord-
ing to the target domain HMM model would be
∼ 8.9e−7, and the probability of b/B b/B would
be ∼ 9e−5. Note also that this set-up does not as-
sume covariate shift.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

Importance weighting, a generalization of various
statistical bias correction techniques, can poten-
tially correct bias in our labeled training data, but
this paper presented a negative result about impor-
tance weighting for unsupervised domain adapta-
tion of POS taggers. We first presented exper-
iments with a wide variety of weight functions,
quantilizations, as well as with randomly gener-
ated weights, none of which lead to significant im-
provements. Our analysis indicates that most er-
rors in POS tagging are due to unseen words, and
what remains seem to not be captured adequately
by unsupervised weight functions.

For future work we plan to extend this work to
further weight functions, data sets and NLP tasks.
