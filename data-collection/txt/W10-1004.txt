Abstract

In this paper, we present a corrected and error-
tagged corpus of essays written by non-native
speakers of English. The corpus contains
63000 words and includes data by learners of
English of nine first language backgrounds.
The annotation was performed at the sentence
level and involved correcting all errors in the
sentence. Error classification includes mis-
takes in preposition and article usage, errors
in grammar, word order, and word choice. We
show an analysis of errors in the annotated
corpus by error categories and first language
backgrounds, as well as inter-annotator agree-
ment on the task.

We also describe a computer program that was
developed to facilitate and standardize the an-
notation procedure for the task. The program
allows for the annotation of various types of
mistakes and was used in the annotation of the
corpus.

1 Introduction

Work on automated methods for detecting and cor-
recting context dependent mistakes (e.g., (Golding
and Roth, 1996; Golding and Roth, 1999; Carlson
et al., 2001)) has taken an interesting turn over the
last few years, and has focused on correcting mis-
takes made by non-native speakers of English. Non-
native writers make a variety of errors in grammar
and word usage. Recently, there has been a lot of
effort on building systems for detecting mistakes in
article and preposition usage (DeFelice, 2008; Eeg-
Olofsson, 2003; Gamon et al., 2008; Han et al.,

2006; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008b). Izumi et al.
(2003) consider several error types, including article
and preposition mistakes, made by Japanese learn-
ers of English, and Nagata et al. (2006) focus on the
errors in mass/count noun distinctions with an ap-
plication to detecting article mistakes also made by
Japanese speakers. Article and preposition mistakes
have been shown to be very common mistakes for
learners of different first language (L1) backgrounds
(Dagneaux et al., 1998; Gamon et al., 2008; Izumi
et al., 2004; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008a), but
there is no systematic study of a whole range of er-
rors non-native writers produce, nor is it clear what
the distribution of different types of mistakes is in
learner language.

In this paper, we describe a corpus of sentences
written by English as a Second Language (ESL)
speakers, annotated for the purposes of developing
an automated system for correcting mistakes in text.
Although the focus of the annotation were errors
in article and preposition usage, all mistakes in the
sentence have been corrected. The data for anno-
tation were taken from two sources: The Interna-
tional Corpus of Learner English (ICLE, (Granger
et al., 2002a)) and Chinese Learners of English Cor-
pus (CLEC, (Gui and Yang, 2003)). The annotated
corpus includes data from speakers of nine first lan-
guage backgrounds. To our knowledge, this is the
first corpus of non-native English text (learner cor-
pus) of fully-corrected sentences from such a diverse
group of learners1. The size of the annotated corpus
is 63000 words, or 2645 sentences. While a corpus

of this size may not seem significant in many natu-
ral language applications, this is in fact a large cor-
pus for this field, especially considering the effort to
correct all mistakes, as opposed to focusing on one
language phenomenon. This corpus was used in the
experiments described in the companion paper (Ro-
zovskaya and Roth, 2010).

The annotation schema that we developed was
motivated by our special interest in errors in arti-
cle and preposition usage, but also includes errors
in verbs, morphology, and noun number. The cor-
pus contains 907 article corrections and 1309 prepo-
sition corrections, in addition to annotated mistakes
of other types.

While the focus of the present paper is on anno-
tating ESL mistakes, we have several goals in mind.
First, we present the annotation procedure for the
task, including an error classification schema, anno-
tation speed, and inter-annotator agreement. Sec-
ond, we describe a computer program that we de-
veloped to facilitate the annotation of mistakes in
text. Third, having such a diverse corpus allows
us to analyze the annotated data with respect to the
source language of the learner. We show the anal-
ysis of the annotated data through an overall break-
down of error types by the writer’s first language.
We also present a detailed analysis of errors in arti-
cle and preposition usage. Finally, it should be noted
that there are currently very few annotated learner
corpora available. Consequently, systems are eval-
uated on different data sets, which makes perfor-
mance comparison impossible. The annotation of
the data presented here is available2 and, thus, can
be used by researchers who obtain access to these
respective corpora3.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
First, we describe previous work on the annotation
of learner corpora and statistics on ESL mistakes.
Section 3 gives a description of the annotation pro-
cedure, Section 4 presents the annotation tool that
was developed for the purpose of this project and
used in the annotation. We then present error statis-
tics based on the annotated corpus across all error
types and separately for errors in article and preposi-
tion usage. Finally, in Section 6 we describe how we

evaluate inter-annotator agreement and show agree-
ment results for the task.

2 Learner Corpora and Error Tagging

In this section, we review research in the annota-
tion and error analysis of learner corpora. For a
review of learner corpus research see, for exam-
ple, (Dı́az-Negrillo, 2006; Granger, 2002b; Pravec,
2002). Comparative error analysis is difficult, as
there are no standardized error-tagging schemas, but
we can get a general idea about the types of errors
prevalent with such speakers. Izumi et al. (2004a)
describe a speech corpus of Japanese learners of En-
glish (NICT JLE). The corpus is corrected and anno-
tated and consists of the transcripts (2 million words)
of the audio-recordings of the English oral profi-
ciency interview test. In the NICT corpus, whose
error tag set consists of 45 tags, about 26.6% of er-
rors are determiner related, and 10% are preposition
related, which makes these two error types the most
common in the corpus (Gamon et al., 2008). The
Chinese Learners of English corpus (CLEC, (Gui
and Yang, 2003)) is a collection of essays written
by Chinese learners of beginning, intermediate, and
advanced levels. This corpus is also corrected and
error-tagged, but the tagging schema does not allow
for an easy isolation of article and preposition errors.
The International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE,
(Granger et al., 2002a)) is a corpus of argumenta-
tive essays by advanced English learners. The cor-
pus contains 2 million words of writing by European
learners from 14 mother tongue backgrounds. While
the entire corpus is not error-tagged, the French sub-
part of the corpus along with other data by French
speakers of a lower level of proficiency has been an-
notated (Dagneaux et al., 1998). The most com-
mon errors for the advanced level of proficiency
were found to be lexical errors (words) (15%), regis-
ter (10%), articles (10%), pronouns (10%), spelling
(8%) , verbs (8%).

In a study of 53 post-intermediate ESOL (mi-
grant) learners in New Zealand (Bitchener et al.,
2005), the most common errors were found to be
prepositions (29%), articles (20%), and verb tense
(22%). Dalgish (1985) conducted a study of er-
rors produced by ESL students enrolled at CUNY.
It was found that across students of different first

29



languages, the most common error types among
24 different error types were errors in article us-
age (28%), vocabulary error (20-25%) (word choice
and idioms), prepositions (18%), and verb-subject
agreement (15%). He also noted that the speakers of
languages without article system made considerably
more article errors, but the breakdown of other error
types across languages was surprisingly similar.

3 Annotation

3.1 Data Selection

Data for annotation were extracted from the ICLE
corpus (Granger et al., 2002a) and CLEC (Gui and
Yang, 2003). As stated in Section 2, the ICLE con-
tains data by European speakers of advanced level
of proficiency, and the CLEC corpus contains es-
says by Chinese learners of different levels of pro-
ficiency. The annotated corpus includes sentences
written by speakers of nine languages: Bulgarian,
Chinese, Czech, French, German, Italian, Polish,
Russian, and Spanish. About half of the sentences
for annotation were selected based on their scores
with respect to a 4-gram language model built using
the English Gigaword corpus (LDC2005T12). This
was done in order to exclude sentences that would
require heavy editing and sentences with near-native
fluency, sentences with scores too high or too low.
Such sentences would be less likely to benefit from
a system on preposition/article correction. The sen-
tences for annotation were a random sample out of
the remaining 80% of the data.

To collect more data for errors in preposition us-
age, we also manually selected sentences that con-
tained such errors. This might explain why the pro-
portion of preposition errors is so high in our data.

3.2 Annotation Procedure

The annotation was performed by three native
speakers of North American English, one under-
graduate and two graduate students, specializing in
foreign languages and Linguistics, with previous ex-
perience in natural language annotation. A sentence
was presented to the annotator in the context of the
essay from which it was extracted. Essay context
can become necessary, especially for the correction
of article errors, when an article is acceptable in the
context of a sentence, but is incorrect in the context

of the essay. The annotators were also encouraged
to propose more than one correction, as long as all
of their suggestions were consistent with the essay
context.

3.3 Annotation Schema

While we were primarily interested in article and
preposition errors, the goal of the annotation was to
correct all mistakes in the sentence. Thus, our er-
ror classification schema4, though motivated by our
interest in errors in article and preposition usage,
was also intended to give us a general idea about
the types of mistakes ESL students make. A better
understanding of the nature of learners’ mistakes is
important for the development of a robust automated
system that detects errors and proposes corrections.
Even when the focus of a correction system is on
one language phenomenon, we would like to have
information about all mistakes in the context: Error
information around the target article or preposition
could help us understand how noisy data affect the
performance.

But more importantly, a learner corpus with er-
ror information could demonstrate how mistakes in-
teract in a sentence. A common approach to de-
tecting and correcting context-sensitive mistakes is
to deal with each phenomenon independently, but
sometimes errors cannot be corrected in isolation.
Consider, for example, the following sentences that
are a part of the corpus that we annotated.

1. ”I should know all important aspects of English.” → ”I should
know all of the important aspects of English.”

2. ”But some of the people thought about him as a parodist of a
rhythm-n-blues singer.” → ”But some people considered him to
be a parodist of a rhythm-n-blues singer.”

3. ”...to be a competent avionics engineer...” → ...”to become com-
petent avionics engineers...”

4. ”...which reflect a traditional female role and a traditional attitude
to a woman...” → ”...which reflect a traditional female role and
a traditional attitude towards women...”

5. ”Marx lived in the epoch when there were no entertainments.”
→ ”Marx lived in an era when there was no entertainment.”

In the examples above, errors interact with one an-
other. In example 1, the context requires a definite
article, and the definite article, in turn, calls for the

4Our error classification was inspired by the classification
developed for the annotation of preposition errors (Tetreault and
Chodorow, 2008a).

30



preposition ”of”. In example 2, the definite article
after ”some of” is used extraneously, and deleting it
also requires deleting preposition ”of”. Another case
of interaction is caused by a word choice error: The
writer used the verb ”thought” instead of ”consid-
ered”; replacing the verb requires also changing the
syntactic construction of the verb complement. In
examples 3 and 4, the article choice before the words
”engineer” and ”woman” depends on the number
value of those nouns. To correctly determine which
article should be used, one needs to determine first
whether the context requires a singular noun ”engi-
neer” or plural ”engineers”. Finally, in example 5,
the form of the predicate in the relative clause de-
pends on the number value of the noun ”entertain-
ment”.

For the reasons mentioned above, the annotation
involved correcting all mistakes in a sentence. The
errors that we distinguish are noun number, spelling,
verb form, and word form, in addition to article and
preposition errors . All other corrections, the major-
ity of which are lexical errors, were marked as word
replacement, word deletion, and word insertion. Ta-
ble 1 gives a description of each error type.

4 Annotation Tool

In this section, we describe a computer program that
was developed to facilitate the annotation process.
The main purpose of the program is to allow an an-
notator to easily mark the type of mistake, when cor-
recting it. In addition, the tool allows us to provide
the annotator with sufficient essay context. As de-
scribed in Section 3, sentences for annotation came
from different essays, so each new sentence was usu-
ally extracted from a new context. To ensure that
the annotators preserved the meaning of the sentence
being corrected, we needed to provide them with the
essay context. A wider context could affect the an-
notator’s decision, especially when determining the
correct article choice. The tool allowed us to effi-
ciently present to the annotator the essay context for
each target sentence.

Fig. 1 shows the program interface. The sentence
for annotation appears in the white text box and the
annotator can type corrections in the box, as if work-
ing in a word processor environment. Above and be-
low the text box we can see the context boxes, where

the rest of the essay is shown. Below the lower con-
text box, there is a list of buttons. The pink buttons
and the dark green buttons correspond to different
error types, the pink buttons are for correcting arti-
cle and preposition errors, and the dark green but-
tons – for correcting other errors. The annotator can
indicate the type of mistake being corrected by plac-
ing the cursor after the word that contains an error
and pressing the button that corresponds to this er-
ror type. Pressing on an error button inserts a pair of
delimiters after the word. The correction can then be
entered between the delimiters. The yellow buttons
and the three buttons next to the pink ones are the
shortcuts that can be used instead of typing in arti-
cles and common preposition corrections. The but-
ton None located next to the article buttons is used
for correcting cases of articles and prepositions used
superfluously. To correct other errors, the annotator
needs to determine the type of error, insert the corre-
sponding delimiters after the word by pressing one
of the error buttons and enter the correction between
the delimiters.

The annotation rate for the three annotators varied
between 30 and 40 sentences per hour.

Table 2 shows sample sentences annotated with
the tool. The proposed corrections are located inside
the delimiters and follow the word to which the cor-
rection refers. When replacing a sequence of words,
the sequence was surrounded with curly braces. This
is useful if a sequence is a multi-word expression,
such as at last.

5 Annotation Statistics

In this section, we present the results of the anno-
tation by error type and the source language of the
writer.

Table 3 shows statistics for the annotated sen-
tences by language group and error type. Because
the sub-corpora differ in size, we show the number
of errors per hundred words. In total, the annotated
corpus contains 63000 words or 2645 sentences of
learner writing. Category punctuation was not spec-
ified in the annotation, but can be easily identified
and includes insertion, deletion, and replacement of
punctuation marks. The largest error category is
word replacement, which combines deleted, inserted
words and word substitutions. This is followed by

Error type Description Examples
Article error Any error involving an article ”Women were indignant at [None/the] inequality

from men.”
Preposition error Any error involving a preposition ”...to change their views [to/for] the better.”
Noun number Errors involving plural/singular

confusion of a noun
”Science is surviving by overcoming the mistakes not
by uttering the [truths/truth] .”

Verb form Errors in verb tense and verb inflec-
tions

”He [write/writes] poetry.”

Word form Correct lexeme, but wrong suffix ”It is not [simply/simple] to make professional army
.”

Spelling Error in spelling ”...if a person [commited/committed] a crime...”
Word insertion, deletion,
or replacement

Other corrections that do not fall
into any of the above categories

”There is a [probability/possibility] that today’s fan-
tasies will not be fantasies tomorrow.”

Table 3: Error statistics on the annotated data by source language and error type

the punctuation category, which comprises 22% of
all corrections. About 12% of all errors involve ar-
ticles, and prepositions comprise 17% of all errors.
We would expect the preposition category to be less
significant if we did not specifically look for such er-
rors, when selecting sentences for annotation. Two
other common categories are spelling and verb form.
Verb form combines errors in verb conjugation and
errors in verb tense. It can be observed from the
table that there is a significantly smaller proportion
of article errors for the speakers of languages that
have articles, such as French or German. Lexical
errors (word replacement) are more common in lan-
guage groups that have a higher rate of errors per
100 words. In contrast, the proportion of punctua-
tion mistakes is higher for those learners that make
fewer errors overall (cf. French, German, Italian,
and Polish). This suggests that punctuation errors
are difficult to master, maybe because rules of punc-
tuation are not generally taught in foreign language
classes. Besides, there is a high degree of variation
in the use of punctuation even among native speak-
ers.

5.1 Statistics on Article Corrections

As stated in Section 2, article errors are one of the
most common mistakes made by non-native speak-
ers of English. This is especially true for the speak-
ers of languages that do not have articles, but for ad-
vanced French speakers this is also a very common
mistake (Dagneaux et al., 1998), suggesting that ar-
ticle usage in English is a very difficult language fea-
ture to master.

Han et al. (2006) show that about 13% of noun
phrases in TOEFL essays by Chinese, Japanese, and

Russian speakers have article mistakes. They also
show that learners do not confuse articles randomly
and the most common article mistakes are omissions
and superfluous article usage. Our findings are sum-
marized in Table 4 and are very similar. We also
distinguish between the superfluous use of a and
the, we allows us to observe that most of the cases
of extraneously used articles involve article the for
all language groups. In fact, extraneous the is the
most common article mistake for the majority of
our speakers. Superfluous the is usually followed
by the omission of the and the omission of a. An-
other statistic that our table demonstrates and that
was shown previously (e.g. (Dalgish, 1985)) is that
learners whose first language does not have articles
make more article mistakes: We can see from col-
umn 3 of the table that the speakers of German,
French and Italian are three to four times less likely
to make an article mistake than the speakers of Chi-
nese and all of the Slavic languages. The only ex-
ception are Spanish speakers. It is not clear whether
the higher error rate is only due to a difference in
overall language proficiency (as is apparent from the
average number of mistakes by these speakers in Ta-
ble 3) or to other factors. Finally, the last column in
the table indicates that confusing articles with pro-
nouns is a relatively common error and on average
accounts for 10% of all article mistakes5. Current
article correction systems do not address this error
type.

5An example of such confusion is ” To pay for the crimes,
criminals are put in prison”, where the is used instead of their.

confusing articles a and the. Multiple labels denotes cases where the annotator specified more than one article choice,
one of which was used by the learner. Other refers to confusing articles with possessive and demonstrative pronouns.

5.2 Statistics on Preposition Corrections

Table 5 shows statistics on errors in preposition us-
age. Preposition mistakes are classified into three
categories: replacements, insertions, and deletions.
Unlike with article errors, the most common type
of preposition errors is confusing two prepositions.
This category accounts for more than half of all er-
rors, and the breakdown is very similar for all lan-
guage groups. The fourth category in the table, with
original, refers to the preposition usages that were
found acceptable by the annotators, but with a bet-
ter suggestion provided. We distinguish this case
as a separate category because preposition usage is
highly variable, unlike, for example, article usage.
Tetreault and Chodorow (Tetreault and Chodorow,
2008a) show that agreement between two native
speakers on a cloze test targeting prepositions is
about 76%, which demonstrates that there are many
contexts that license multiple prepositions.

6 Inter-annotator Agreement

Correcting non-native text for a variety of mistakes
is challenging and requires a number of decisions on
the part of the annotator. Human language allows for
many ways to express the same idea. Furthermore, it
is possible that the corrected sentence, even when it
does not contain clear mistakes, does not sound like
a sentence produced by a native speaker. The latter
is complicated by the fact that native speakers differ
widely with respect to what constitutes acceptable
usage (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008a).

To date, a common approach to annotating non-
native text has been to use one rater (Gamon et al.,

type and source language of the writer. With orig refers to
prepositions judged as acceptable by the annotators, but
with a better suggestion provided.

2008; Han et al., 2006; Izumi et al., 2004; Na-
gata et al., 2006). The output of human annota-
tion is viewed as the gold standard when evaluating
an error detection system. The question of reliabil-
ity of using one rater has been raised in (Tetreault
and Chodorow, 2008a), where an extensive reliabil-
ity study of human judgments in rating preposition
usage is described. In particular, it is shown that
inter-annotator agreement on preposition correction
is low (kappa value of 0.63) and that native speakers
do not always agree on whether a specific preposi-
tion constitutes acceptable usage.

We measure agreement by asking an annotator
whether a sentence corrected by another person is
correct. After all, our goal was to make the sentence
sound native-like, without enforcing that errors are
corrected in the same way. One hundred sentences
annotated by each person were selected and the cor-

Table 6: Annotator agreement at the sentence level. The
number next to the agreement set denotes the annotator
who corrected the sentences on the first pass. Judged cor-
rect denotes the proportion of sentences in the agreement
set that the second rater did not change. Judged incorrect
denotes the proportion of sentences, in which the second
rater made corrections.

rections were applied. This corrected set was mixed
with new sentences and given to the other two anno-
tators. In this manner, each annotator received two
hundred sentences corrected by the other two anno-
tators. For each pair of the annotators, we compute
agreement based on the 100 sentences on which they
did a second pass after the initial corrections by the
third rater. To compute agreement at the sentence
level, we assign the annotated sentences to one of
the two categories: ”correct” and ”incorrect”: A sen-
tence is considered ”correct” if a rater did not make
any corrections in it on the second pass 6. Table 6
shows for each agreement set the number of sen-
tences that were corrected on the second pass. On
average, 40.8% of the agreement set sentences be-
long to the ”incorrect” category, but the proportion
of ”incorrect” sentences varies across annotators.

We also compute agreement on the two cate-
gories, ”correct” and ”incorrect”. The agreement
and the kappa values are shown in Table 7. Agree-
ment on the sentences corrected on the second pass
varies between 56% to 78% with kappa values rang-
ing from 0.16 to 0.40. The low numbers reflect the
difficulty of the task and the variability of the na-
tive speakers’ judgments about acceptable usage. In
fact, since the annotation requires looking at sev-
eral phenomena, we can expect a lower agreement,
when compared to agreement rate on one language
phenomenon. Suppose rater A disagrees with rater
B on a given phenomenon with probability 1/4,
then, when there are two phenomena, the probabil-
ity that he will disagree with at least on of them is

6We ignore punctuation corrections.

Agreement set Agreement kappa
Agreement set 1 56% 0.16
Agreement set 2 78% 0.40
Agreement set 3 60% 0.23

Table 7: Agreement at the sentence level. Agreement
shows how many sentences in each agreement set were
assigned to the same category (”correct”, ”incorrect”) for
each of the two raters.

1 − 9/16 = 7/16. And the probability goes down
with the number of phenomena.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a corpus of essays by stu-
dents of English of nine first language backgrounds,
corrected and annotated for errors. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first fully-corrected corpus that con-
tains such diverse data. We have described an anno-
tation schema, have shown statistics on the error dis-
tribution for writers of different first language back-
grounds and inter-annotator agreement on the task.
We have also described a program that was devel-
oped to facilitate the annotation process.

While natural language annotation, especially in
the context of error correction, is a challenging and
time-consuming task, research in learner corpora
and annotation is important for the development of
robust systems for correcting and detecting errors.
