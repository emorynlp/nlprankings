Abstract

The automatic interpretation of noun-noun
compounds is an important subproblem
within many natural language processing
applications and is an area of increasing
interest. The problem is difficult, with dis-
agreement regarding the number and na-
ture of the relations, low inter-annotator
agreement, and limited annotated data. In
this paper, we present a novel taxonomy
of relations that integrates previous rela-
tions, the largest publicly-available anno-
tated dataset, and a supervised classifica-
tion method for automatic noun compound
interpretation.

1 Introduction

Noun compounds (e.g., ‘maple leaf’) occur very
frequently in text, and their interpretation—
determining the relationships between adjacent
nouns as well as the hierarchical dependency
structure of the NP in which they occur—is an
important problem within a wide variety of nat-
ural language processing (NLP) applications, in-
cluding machine translation (Baldwin and Tanaka,
2004) and question answering (Ahn et al., 2005).
The interpretation of noun compounds is a difficult
problem for various reasons (Spärck Jones, 1983).
Among them is the fact that no set of relations pro-
posed to date has been accepted as complete and
appropriate for general-purpose text. Regardless,
automatic noun compound interpretation is the fo-
cus of an upcoming SEMEVAL task (Butnariu et
al., 2009).

Leaving aside the problem of determining the
dependency structure among strings of three or
more nouns—a problem we do not address in this
paper—automatic noun compound interpretation
requires a taxonomy of noun-noun relations, an
automatic method for accurately assigning the re-

lations to noun compounds, and, in the case of su-
pervised classification, a sufficiently large dataset
for training.

Earlier work has often suffered from using tax-
onomies with coarse-grained, highly ambiguous
predicates, such as prepositions, as various labels
(Lauer, 1995) and/or unimpressive inter-annotator
agreement among human judges (Kim and Bald-
win, 2005). In addition, the datasets annotated ac-
cording to these various schemes have often been
too small to provide wide coverage of the noun
compounds likely to occur in general text.

In this paper, we present a large, fine-grained
taxonomy of 43 noun compound relations, a
dataset annotated according to this taxonomy, and
a supervised, automatic classification method for
determining the relation between the head and
modifier words in a noun compound. We com-
pare and map our relations to those in other tax-
onomies and report the promising results of an
inter-annotator agreement study as well as an au-
tomatic classification experiment. We examine the
various features used for classification and iden-
tify one very useful, novel family of features. Our
dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest
noun compound dataset yet produced. We will
make it available via http://www.isi.edu.

2 Related Work

2.1 Taxonomies

The relations between the component nouns in
noun compounds have been the subject of various
linguistic studies performed throughout the years,
including early work by Jespersen (1949). The
taxonomies they created are varied. Lees created
an early taxonomy based primarily upon grammar
(Lees, 1960). Levi’s influential work postulated
that complex nominals (Levi’s name for noun com-
pounds that also permits certain adjectival modi-
fiers) are all derived either via nominalization or

678



by deleting one of nine predicates (i.e., CAUSE,
HAVE, MAKE, USE, BE, IN, FOR, FROM, ABOUT)
from an underlying sentence construction (Levi,
1978). Of the taxonomies presented by purely
linguistic studies, our categories are most similar
to those proposed by Warren (1978), whose cat-
egories (e.g., MATERIAL+ARTEFACT, OBJ+PART)
are generally less ambiguous than Levi’s.

In contrast to studies that claim the existence of
a relatively small number of semantic relations,
Downing (1977) presents a strong case for the
existence of an unbounded number of relations.
While we agree with Downing’s belief that the
number of relations is unbounded, we contend that
the vast majority of noun compounds fits within a
relatively small set of categories.

The relations used in computational linguistics
vary much along the same lines as those proposed
earlier by linguists. Several lines of work (Finin,
1980; Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008) as-
sume the existence of an unbounded number of re-
lations. Others use categories similar to Levi’s,
such as Lauer’s (1995) set of prepositional para-
phrases (i.e., OF, FOR, IN, ON, AT, FROM, WITH,
ABOUT) to analyze noun compounds. Some work
(e.g., Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Nastase and
Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et al., 2005; Kim and
Baldwin, 2005) use sets of categories that are
somewhat more similar to those proposed by War-
ren (1978). While most of the noun compound re-
search to date is not domain specific, Rosario and
Hearst (2001) create and experiment with a taxon-
omy tailored to biomedical text.

2.2 Classification

The approaches used for automatic classification
are also varied. Vanderwende (1994) presents one
of the first systems for automatic classification,
which extracted information from online sources
and used a series of rules to rank a set of most
likely interpretations. Lauer (1995) uses corpus
statistics to select a prepositional paraphrase. Sev-
eral lines of work, including that of Barker and
Szpakowicz (1998), use memory-based methods.
Kim and Baldwin (2005) and Turney (2006) use
nearest neighbor approaches based upon WordNet
(Fellbaum, 1998) and Turney’s Latent Relational
Analysis, respectively. Rosario and Hearst (2001)
utilize neural networks to classify compounds ac-
cording to their domain-specific relation taxon-
omy. Moldovan et al. (2004) use SVMs as well as

a novel algorithm (i.e., semantic scattering). Nas-
tase et al. (2006) experiment with a variety of clas-
sification methods including memory-based meth-
ods, SVMs, and decision trees. Ó Séaghdha and
Copestake (2009) use SVMs and experiment with
kernel methods on a dataset labeled using a rela-
tively small taxonomy. Girju (2009) uses cross-
linguistic information from parallel corpora to aid
classification.

3 Taxonomy

3.1 Creation

Given the heterogeneity of past work, we decided
to start fresh and build a new taxonomy of re-
lations using naturally occurring noun pairs, and
then compare the result to earlier relation sets.
We collected 17509 noun pairs and over a period
of 10 months assigned one or more relations to
each, gradually building and refining our taxon-
omy. More details regarding the dataset are pro-
vided in Section 4.

The relations we produced were then compared
to those present in other taxonomies (e.g., Levi,
1978; Warren, 1978; Barker and Szpakowicz,
1998; Girju et al., 2005), and they were found to
be fairly similar. We present a detailed comparison
in Section 3.4.

We tested the relation set with an initial
inter-annotator agreement study (our latest inter-
annotator agreement study results are presented in
Section 6). However, the mediocre results indi-
cated that the categories and/or their definitions
needed refinement. We then embarked on a se-
ries of changes, testing each generation by anno-
tation using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, a
relatively quick and inexpensive online platform
where requesters may publish tasks for anony-
mous online workers (Turkers) to perform. Me-
chanical Turk has been previously used in a va-
riety of NLP research, including recent work on
noun compounds by Nakov (2008) to collect short
phrases for linking the nouns within noun com-
pounds.

For the Mechanical Turk annotation tests, we
created five sets of 100 noun compounds from
noun compounds automatically extracted from a
random subset of New York Times articles written
between 1987 and 2007 (Sandhaus, 2008). Each
of these sets was used in a separate annotation
round. For each round, a set of 100 noun com-
pounds was uploaded along with category defini-

tions and examples. Turkers were asked to select
one or, if they deemed it appropriate, two cate-
gories for each noun pair. After all annotations for
the round were completed, they were examined,
and any taxonomic changes deemed appropriate
(e.g., the creation, deletion, and/or modification of
categories) were incorporated into the taxonomy
before the next set of 100 was uploaded. The cate-
gories were substantially modified during this pro-
cess. They are shown in Table 1 along with exam-
ples and an approximate mapping to several other
taxonomies.

3.2 Category Descriptions
Our categories are defined with sentences. For
example, the SUBSTANCE category has the
definition n1 is one of the primary physi-
cal substances/materials/ingredients that n2 is
made/composed out of/from. Our LOCATION cat-
egory’s definition reads n1 is the location / geo-
graphic scope where n2 is at, near, from, gener-
ally found, or occurs. Defining the categories with
sentences is advantageous because it is possible to
create straightforward, explicit defintions that hu-
mans can easily test examples against.

3.3 Taxonomy Groupings
In addition to influencing the category defini-
tions, some taxonomy groupings were altered with
the hope that this would improve inter-annotator
agreement for cases where Turker disagreement
was systematic. For example, LOCATION and
WHOLE + PART/MEMBER OF were commonly dis-
agreed upon by Turkers so they were placed within
their own taxonomic subgroup. The ambiguity
between these categories has previously been ob-
served by Girju (2009).

Turkers also tended to disagree between the
categories related to composition and contain-
ment. Due this apparent similarity they were also
grouped together in the taxonomy.

The ATTRIBUTE categories are positioned near
the TOPIC group because some Turkers chose a
TOPIC category when an ATTRIBUTE category was
deemed more appropriate. This may be because
attributes are relatively abstract concepts that are
often somewhat descriptive of whatever possesses
them. A prime example of this is street name.

3.4 Contrast with other Taxonomies
In order to ensure completeness, we mapped into
our taxonomy the relations proposed in most pre-

vious work including those of Barker and Sz-
pakowicz (1998) and Girju et al. (2005). The
results, shown in Table 1, demonstrate that our
taxonomy is similar to several taxonomies used
in other work. However, there are three main
differences and several less important ones. The
first major difference is the absence of a signif-
icant THEME or OBJECT category. The second
main difference is that our taxonomy does not in-
clude a PURPOSE category and, instead, has sev-
eral smaller categories. Finally, instead of pos-
sessing a single TOPIC category, our taxonomy has
several, finer-grained TOPIC categories. These dif-
ferences are significant because THEME/OBJECT,
PURPOSE, and TOPIC are typically among the
most frequent categories.

THEME/OBJECT is typically the category to
which other researchers assign noun compounds
whose head noun is a nominalized verb and whose
modifier noun is the THEME/OBJECT of the verb.
This is typically done with the justification that the
relation/predicate (the root verb of the nominaliza-
tion) is overtly expressed.

While including a THEME/OBJECT category has
the advantage of simplicity, its disadvantages are
significant. This category leads to a significant
ambiguity in examples because many compounds
fitting the THEME/OBJECT category also match
some other category as well. Warren (1978) gives
the examples of soup pot and soup container
to illustrate this issue, and Girju (2009) notes a
substantial overlap between THEME and MAKE-
PRODUCE. Our results from Mechanical Turk
showed significant overlap between PURPOSE and
OBJECT categories (present in an earlier version of
the taxonomy). For this reason, we do not include
a separate THEME/OBJECT category. If it is im-
portant to know whether the modifier also holds a
THEME/OBJECT relationship, we suggest treating
this as a separate classification task.

The absence of a single PURPOSE category
is another distinguishing characteristic of our
taxonomy. Instead, the taxonomy includes a
number of finer-grained categories (e.g., PER-
FORM/ENGAGE_IN), which can be conflated to
create a PURPOSE category if necessary. During
our Mechanical Turk-based refinement process,
our now-defunct PURPOSE category was found
to be ambiguous with many other categories as
well as difficult to define. This problem has been
noted by others. For example, Warren (1978)

681



points out that tea in tea cup qualifies as both the
content and the purpose of the cup. Similarly,
while WHOLE+PART/MEMBER was selected by
most Turkers for bike tire, one individual chose
PURPOSE. Our investigation identified five main
purpose-like relations that most of our PURPOSE
examples can be divided into, including activity
performance (PERFORM/ENGAGE_IN), cre-
ation/provision (CREATE/PROVIDE/CAUSE OF),
obtainment/access (OBTAIN/ACCESS/SEEK),
supervision/management (ORGA-
NIZE/SUPERVISE/AUTHORITY), and opposition
(MITIGATE/OPPOSE/DESTROY).

The third major distinguishing different be-
tween our taxonomy and others is the absence of a
single TOPIC/ABOUT relation. Instead, our taxon-
omy has several finer-grained categories that can
be conflated into a TOPIC category. Unlike the
previous two distinguishing characteristics, which
were motivated primarily by Turker annotations,
this separation was largely motivated by author
dissatisfaction with a single TOPIC category.

Two differentiating characteristics of less im-
portance are the absence of BENEFICIARY or
SOURCE categories (Barker and Szpakowicz,
1998; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju et
al., 2005). Our EMPLOYER, CONSUMER, and
USER/RECIPIENT categories combined more or
less cover BENEFICIARY. Since SOURCE is am-
biguous in multiple ways including causation
(tsunami injury), provision (government grant),
ingredients (rice wine), and locations (north
wind), we chose to exclude it.

4 Dataset

Our noun compound dataset was created from
two principal sources: an in-house collection of
terms extracted from a large corpus using part-
of-speech tagging and mutual information and the
Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank.
Compounds including one or more proper nouns
were ignored. In total, the dataset contains 17509
unique, out-of-context examples, making it by far
the largest hand-annotated compound noun dataset
in existence that we are aware of. Proper nouns
were not included.

The next largest available datasets have a vari-
ety of drawbacks for noun compound interpreta-
tion in general text. Kim and Baldwin’s (2005)
dataset is the second largest available dataset, but
inter-annotator agreement was only 52.3%, and

the annotations had an usually lopsided distribu-
tion; 42% of the data has TOPIC labels. Most
(73.23%) of Girju’s (2007) dataset consists of
noun-preposition-noun constructions. Rosario and
Heart’s (2001) dataset is specific to the biomed-
ical domain, while Ó Séaghdha and Copestake’s
(2009) data is labeled with only 5 extremely
coarse-grained categories. The remaining datasets
are too small to provide wide coverage. See Table
2 below for size comparison with other publicly
available, semantically annotated datasets.

5 Automated Classification

We use a Maximum Entropy (Berger et al., 1996)
classifier with a large number of boolean features,
some of which are novel (e.g., the inclusion of
words from WordNet definitions). Maximum En-
tropy classifiers have been effective on a variety of
NLP problems including preposition sense disam-
biguation (Ye and Baldwin, 2007), which is some-
what similar to noun compound interpretation. We
use the implementation provided in the MALLET
machine learning toolkit (McCallum, 2002).

5.1 Features Used

WordNet-based Features

• {Synonyms, Hypernyms} for all NN and VB
entries for each word
• Intersection of the words’ hypernyms
• All terms from the ‘gloss’ for each word
• Intersection of the words’ ‘gloss’ terms
• Lexicographer file names for each word’s NN

and VB entries (e.g., n1:substance)

682



• Logical AND of lexicographer file names
for the two words (e.g., n1:substance ∧
n2:artifact)
• Lists of all link types (e.g., meronym links)

associated with each word
• Logical AND of the link types (e.g.,

n1:hasMeronym(s) ∧ n2:hasHolonym(s))
• Part-of-speech (POS) indicators for the exis-

tence of VB, ADJ, and ADV entries for each
of the nouns
• Logical AND of the POS indicators for the

two words
• ‘Lexicalized’ indicator for the existence of an

entry for the compound as a single term
• Indicators if either word is a part of the other

word according to Part-Of links
• Indicators if either word is a hypernym of the

other
• Indicators if either word is in the definition of

the other

Roget’s Thesaurus-based Features

• Roget’s divisions for all noun (and verb) en-
tries for each word
• Roget’s divisions shared by the two words

Surface-level Features

• Indicators for the suffix types (e.g., de-
adjectival, de-nominal [non]agentive, de-
verbal [non]agentive)
• Indicators for degree, number, order, or loca-

tive prefixes (e.g., ultra-, poly-, post-, and
inter-, respectively)
• Indicators for whether or not a preposition

occurs within either term (e.g., ‘down’ in
‘breakdown’)
• The last {two, three} letters of each word

Web 1T N-gram Features
To provide information related to term usage to

the classifier, we extracted trigram and 4-gram fea-
tures from the Web 1T Corpus (Brants and Franz,
2006), a large collection of n-grams and their
counts created from approximately one trillion
words of Web text. Only n-grams containing low-
ercase words were used. 5-grams were not used
due to memory limitations. Only n-grams con-
taining both terms (including plural forms) were
extracted. Table 3 describes the extracted n-gram
features.

5.2 Cross Validation Experiments
We performed 10-fold cross validation on our
dataset, and, for the purpose of comparison,
we also performed 5-fold cross validation on Ó
Séaghdha’s (2007) dataset using his folds. Our
classification accuracy results are 79.3% on our
data and 63.6% on the Ó Séaghdha data. We
used the χ2 measure to limit our experiments
to the most useful 35000 features, which is the
point where we obtain the highest results on Ó
Séaghdha’s data. The 63.6% figure is similar to the
best previously reported accuracy for this dataset
of 63.1%, which was obtained by Ó Séaghdha and
Copestake (2009) using kernel methods.

For comparison with SVMs, we used Thorsten
Joachims’ SVMmulticlass, which implements an
optimization solution to Cramer and Singer’s
(2001) multiclass SVM formulation. The best re-
sults were similar, with 79.4% on our dataset and
63.1% on Ó Séaghdha’s. SVMmulticlass was, how-
ever, observed to be very sensitive to the tuning
of the C parameter, which determines the tradeoff
between training error and margin width. The best
results for the datasets were produced with C set
to 5000 and 375 respectively.

Table 3: Patterns for extracting trigram and 4-
Gram features from the Web 1T Corpus for a given
noun compound (n1 n2).

To assess the impact of the various features, we
ran the cross validation experiments for each fea-
ture type, alternating between including only one

683



feature type and including all feature types except
that one. The results for these runs using the Max-
imum Entropy classifier are presented in Table 4.

There are several points of interest in these re-
sults. The WordNet gloss terms had a surpris-
ingly strong influence. In fact, by themselves they
proved roughly as useful as the hypernym features,
and their removal had the single strongest negative
impact on accuracy for our dataset. As far as we
know, this is the first time that WordNet definition
words have been used as features for noun com-
pound interpretation. In the future, it may be valu-
able to add definition words from other machine-
readable dictionaries. The influence of the Web 1T
n-gram features was somewhat mixed. They had a
positive impact on the Ó Séaghdha data, but their
affect upon our dataset was limited and mixed,
with the removal of the 4-gram features actually
improving performance slightly.

6 Evaluation

6.1 Evaluation Data

To assess the quality of our taxonomy and classi-
fication method, we performed an inter-annotator
agreement study using 150 noun compounds ex-
tracted from a random subset of articles taken
from New York Times articles dating back to 1987
(Sandhaus, 2008). The terms were selected based
upon their frequency (i.e., a compound occurring
twice as often as another is twice as likely to be
selected) to label for testing purposes. Using a
heuristic similar to that used by Lauer (1995), we
only extracted binary noun compounds not part of
a larger sequence. Before reaching the 150 mark,
we discarded 94 of the drawn examples because
they were included in the training set. Thus, our
training set covers roughly 38.5% of the binary
noun compound instances in recent New York
Times articles.

6.2 Annotators

Due to the relatively high speed and low cost of
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service, we chose to
use Mechanical Turkers as our annotators.

Using Mechanical Turk to obtain inter-
annotator agreement figures has several draw-
backs. The first and most significant drawback is
that it is impossible to force each Turker to label
every data point without putting all the terms onto
a single web page, which is highly impractical
for a large taxonomy. Some Turkers may label
every compound, but most do not. Second,
while we requested that Turkers only work on
our task if English was their first language, we
had no method of enforcing this. Third, Turker
annotation quality varies considerably.

6.3 Combining Annotators

To overcome the shortfalls of using Turkers for an
inter-annotator agreement study, we chose to re-
quest ten annotations per noun compound and then
combine the annotations into a single set of selec-
tions using a weighted voting scheme. To com-
bine the results, we calculated a “quality” score for
each Turker based upon how often he/she agreed
with the others. This score was computed as the
average percentage of other Turkers who agreed
with his/her annotations. The score for each label
for a particular compound was then computed as
the sum of the Turker quality scores of the Turkers

684



who annotated the compound. Finally, the label
with the highest rating was selected.

6.4 Inter-annotator Agreement Results

The raw agreement scores along with Cohen’s κ
(Cohen, 1960), a measure of inter-annotator agree-
ment that discounts random chance, were calcu-
lated against the authors’ labeling of the data for
each Turker, the weighted-voting annotation set,
and the automatic classification output. These
statistics are reported in Table 5 along with the
individual Turker “quality” scores. The 54 Turk-
ers who made fewer than 3 annotations were ex-
cluded from the calculations under the assumption
that they were not dedicated to the task, leaving a
total of 49 Turkers. Due to space limitations, only
results for Turkers who annotated 15 or more in-
stances are included in Table 5.

We recomputed the κ statistics after conflating
the category groups in two different ways. The
first variation involved conflating all the TOPIC
categories into a single topic category, resulting in
a total of 37 categories (denoted by κ* in Table
5). For the second variation, in addition to con-
flating the TOPIC categories, we conflated the AT-
TRIBUTE categories into a single category and the
PURPOSE/ACTIVITY categories into a single cate-
gory, for a total of 27 categories (denoted by κ**
in Table 5).

6.5 Results Discussion

The .57-.67 κ figures achieved by the Voted an-
notations compare well with previously reported
inter-annotator agreement figures for noun com-
pounds using fine-grained taxonomies. Kim and
Baldwin (2005) report an agreement of 52.31%
(not κ) for their dataset using Barker and Sz-
pakowicz’s (1998) 20 semantic relations. Girju
et al. (2005) report .58 κ using a set of 35 se-
mantic relations, only 21 of which were used, and
a .80 κ score using Lauer’s 8 prepositional para-
phrases. Girju (2007) reports .61 κ agreement
using a similar set of 22 semantic relations for
noun compound annotation in which the annota-
tors are shown translations of the compound in for-
eign languages. Ó Séaghdha (2007) reports a .68
κ for a relatively small set of relations (BE, HAVE,
IN, INST, ACTOR, ABOUT) after removing com-
pounds with non-specific associations or high lex-
icalization. The correlation between our automatic
“quality” scores for the Turkers who performed at

least three annotations and their simple agreement
with our annotations was very strong at 0.88.

The .51 automatic classification figure is re-
spectable given the larger number of categories in
the taxonomy. It is also important to remember
that the training set covers a large portion of the
two-word noun compound instances in recent New
York Times articles, so substantially higher accu-
racy can be expected on many texts. Interestingly,
conflating categories only improved the κ statis-
tics for the Turkers, not the automatic classifier.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a novel, fine-grained tax-
onomy of 43 noun-noun semantic relations, the
largest annotated noun compound dataset yet cre-
ated, and a supervised classification method for
automatic noun compound interpretation.

We describe our taxonomy and provide map-
pings to taxonomies used by others. Our inter-
annotator agreement study, which utilized non-
experts, shows good inter-annotator agreement

685



given the difficulty of the task, indicating that our
category definitions are relatively straightforward.
Our taxonomy provides wide coverage, with only
2.32% of our dataset marked as other/lexicalized
and 2.67% of our 150 inter-annotator agreement
data marked as such by the combined Turker
(Voted) annotation set.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of a straight-
forward, supervised classification approach to
noun compound interpretation that uses a large va-
riety of boolean features. We also examined the
importance of the different features, noting a novel
and very useful set of features—the words com-
prising the definitions of the individual words.

8 Future Work

In the future, we plan to focus on the interpretation
of noun compounds with 3 or more nouns, a prob-
lem that includes bracketing noun compounds into
their dependency structures in addition to noun-
noun semantic relation interpretation. Further-
more, we would like to build a system that can
handle longer noun phrases, including preposi-
tions and possessives.

We would like to experiment with including fea-
tures from various other lexical resources to deter-
mine their usefulness for this problem.

Eventually, we would like to expand our data
set and relations to cover proper nouns as well.
We are hopeful that our current dataset and re-
lation definitions, which will be made available
via http://www.isi.edu will be helpful to other re-
searchers doing work regarding text semantics.
