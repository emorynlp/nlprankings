Abstract

We introduce the first dataset for human edits
of machine-generated visual stories and ex-
plore how these collected edits may be used
for the visual story post-editing task. The
dataset, VIST-Edit1, includes 14,905 human-
edited versions of 2,981 machine-generated
visual stories. The stories were generated by
two state-of-the-art visual storytelling models,
each aligned to 5 human-edited versions. We
establish baselines for the task, showing how
a relatively small set of human edits can be
leveraged to boost the performance of large
visual storytelling models. We also discuss
the weak correlation between automatic evalu-
ation scores and human ratings, motivating the
need for new automatic metrics.

1 Introduction

Professional writers emphasize the importance of
editing. Stephen King once put it this way:
“to write is human, to edit is divine.” (King,
2000) Mark Twain had another quote: “Writing
is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong
words.” (Twain, 1876) Given that professionals re-
vise and rewrite their drafts intensively, machines
that generate stories may also benefit from a good
editor. Per the evaluation of the first Visual Story-
telling Challenge (Mitchell et al., 2018), the ability
of an algorithm to tell a sound story is still far from
that of a human. Users will inevitably need to edit
generated stories before putting them to real uses,
such as sharing on social media.

We introduce the first dataset for human edits
of machine-generated visual stories, VIST-Edit,
and explore how these collected edits may be used
for the task of visual story post-editing (see Fig-
ure 1). The original visual storytelling (VIST)
task, as introduced by Huang et al. (2016), takes

a sequence of five photos as input and generates a
short story describing the photo sequence. Huang
et al. also released the VIST dataset, containing
20,211 photo sequences, aligned to human-written
stories. On the other hand, the automatic post-
editing task revises the story generated from vi-
sual storytelling models, given both a machine-
generated story and a photo sequence. Automatic
post-editing treats the VIST system as a black box
that is fixed and not modifiable. Its goal is to
correct systematic errors of the VIST system and
leverage the user edit data to improve story quality.

In this paper, we (i) collect human edits
for machine-generated stories from two different
state-of-the-art models, (ii) analyze what people
edited, and (iii) advance the task of visual story
post-editing. In addition, we establish baselines
for the task, and discuss the weak correlation be-
tween automatic evaluation scores and human rat-
ings, motivating the need for new metrics.

2 Related Work

The visual story post-editing task is related to (i)
automatic post-editing and (ii) stylized visual cap-
tioning. Automatic post-editing (APE) revises
the text generated typically from a machine trans-
lation (MT) system, given both the source sen-
tences and translated sentences. Like the pro-
posed VIST post-editing task, APE aims to correct
the systematic errors of MT, reducing translator
workloads and increasing productivity (Astudillo
et al., 2018). Recently, neural models have been
applied to APE in a sentence-to-sentence man-
ner (Libovickỳ et al., 2016; Junczys-Dowmunt
and Grundkiewicz, 2016), differing from previ-
ous phrase-based models that translate and re-
order phrase segments for each sentence, such
as (Simard et al., 2007; Béchara et al., 2011).
More sophisticated sequence-to-sequence mod-
els with the attention mechanism were also in-
troduced (Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz,
2017; Libovickỳ and Helcl, 2017). While this line
of work is relevant and encouraging, it has not ex-
plored much in a creative writing context. It is
noteworthy that Roemmele et al. previously de-
veloped an online system, Creative Help, for col-
lecting human edits for computer-generated nar-
rative text (Roemmele and Gordon, 2018b). The
collected data could be useful for story APE tasks.

Visual story post-editing could also be consid-
ered relevant to style transfer on image cap-
tions. Both tasks take images and source text (i.e.,
machine-generated stories or descriptive captions)
as inputs and generate modified text (i.e., post-
edited stories or stylized captions). End-to-end
neural models have been applied to the transfer
styles of image captions. For example, StyleNet,
an encoder-decoder-based model trained on paired
images and factual captions together with an unla-
beled stylized text corpus, can transfer descriptive
image captions to creative captions, e.g., humor-
ous or romantic (Gan et al., 2017). Its advanced
version with an attention mechanism, SemStyle,
was also introduced (Mathews et al., 2018). In this
paper, we adopt the APE approach to treat pre-
and post-edited stories as parallel data instead of
the style transfer approach that omits this parallel
relationship during model training.

3 Dataset Construction & Analysis

Obtaining Machine-Generated Visual Stories
This VIST-Edit dataset contains visual stories gen-

struction (not shown to save space) is given and work-
ers are asked to stick with the plot of the original story.

erated by two state-of-the-art models, GLAC and
AREL. GLAC (Global-Local Attention Cascad-
ing Networks) (Kim et al., 2018) achieved the
highest human evaluation score in the first VIST
Challenge (Mitchell et al., 2018). We obtain the
pre-trained GLAC model provided by the authors
via Github and run it on the entire VIST test set
and obtain 2,019 stories. AREL (Adversarial RE-
ward Learning) (Wang et al., 2018) was the earli-
est available implementation online, and achieved
the highest METEOR score on public test set in
the VIST Challenge. We also acquire a small set
of human edits for 962 AREL’s stories generated
using VIST test set, collected by Hsu et al. (2019).

Crowdsourcing Edits For each machine-
generated visual story, we recruit five crowd
workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
to revise it (at $0.12/HIT,) respectively. We
instruct workers to edit the story “as if these were
your photos, and you would like using this story
to share your experience with your friends.” We
also ask workers to stick with the photos of the
original story so that workers would not ignore
the machine-generated story and write a new one
from scratch. Figure 2 shows the interface. For
GLAC, we collect 2,019 × 5 = 10,095 edited
stories in total; and for AREL, 962 × 5 = 4,810
edited stories have been collected by Hsu et
al. (2019).

Data Post-processing We tokenize all stories
using CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) and replace
all people names with generic [male/female] to-
kens. Each of GLAC and AREL set is released
as training, validation, and test following an 80%,
10%, 10% split, respectively.

3.1 What do people edit?

We analyze human edits for GLAC and AREL.
First, crowd workers systematically increase lexi-
cal diversity. We use type-token ratio (TTR), the



6583

ratio between the number of word types and the
number of tokens, to estimate the lexical diversity
of a story (Hardie and McEnery, 2006). Figure 3
shows significant (p<.001, paired t-test) positive
shifts of TTR for both AREL and GLAC, which
confirms the findings in Hsu et al. (2019). Fig-
ure 3 also indicates that GLAC generates stories
with higher lexical diversity than that of AREL.

Figure 3: KDE plot of type-token ratio (TTR) for pre-
/post-edited stories. People increase lexical diversity in
machine-generated stories for both AREL and GLAC.

Second, people shorten AREL’s stories but
lengthen GLAC’s stories. We calculate the aver-
age number of Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags for to-
kens in each story using the python NLTK (Bird
et al., 2009) package, as shown in Table 1. We
also find that the average number of tokens in
an AREL story (43.0, SD=5.0) decreases (41.9,
SD=5.6) after human editing, while that of GLAC
(35.0, SD=4.5) increases (36.7, SD=5.9). Hsu
has observed that people often replace “deter-
miner/article + noun” phrases (e.g., “a boy”) with
pronouns (e.g., “he”) in AREL stories (2019).
However, this observation cannot explain the story
lengthening in GLAC, where each story on av-
erage has an increased 0.9 nouns after editing.
Given the average per-story edit distances (Leven-
shtein, 1966; Damerau, 1964) for AREL (16.84,
SD=5.64) and GLAC (17.99, SD=5.56) are simi-
lar, this difference is unlikely to be caused by de-
viation in editing amount.

per story. (∆: the differences between post- and pre-
edit stories. NUM is omitted because it is nearly 0.
Numbers are rounded to one decimal place.)

Deleting extra words requires much less time
than other editing operations (Popovic et al.,
2014). Per Figure 3, AREL’s stories are much

more repetitive. We further analyze the type-token
ratio for nouns (TTRnoun) and find AREL gener-
ates duplicate nouns. The average TTRnoun of
an AREL’s story is 0.76 while that of GLAC is
0.90. For reference, the average TTRnoun of a
human-written story (the entire VIST dataset) is
0.86. Thus, we hypothesize workers prioritized
their efforts in deleting repetitive words for AREL,
resulting in the reduction of story length.

4 Baseline Experiments

We report baseline experiments on the visual story
post-editing task in Table 2. AREL’s post-editing
models are trained on the augmented AREL train-
ing set and evaluated on the AREL test set of VIST-
Edit, and GLAC’s models are tested using GLAC
sets, too. Figure 4 shows examples of the out-
put. Human evaluations (Table 2) indicate that the
post-editing model improves visual story quality.

4.1 Methods

Two neural approaches, Long short-term memory
(LSTM) and Transformer, are used as baselines,
where we experiment using (i) text only (T) and
(ii) both text and images (T+I) as inputs.

LSTM An LSTM seq2seq model is
used (Sutskever et al., 2014). For the text-only
setting, the original stories and the human-edited
stories are treated as source-target pairs. For
the text-image setting, we first extract the im-
age features using the pre-trained ResNet-152
model (He et al., 2016) and represent each image
as a 2048-dimensional vector. We then apply a
dense layer on image features in order to both
fit its dimension to the word embedding and
learn the adjusting transformation. By placing
the image features in front of the sequence of
text embedding, the input sequence becomes a
matrix ∈ R(5+len)×dim, where len is the text
sequence length, 5 means 5 photos, and dim is
the dimension of the word embedding. The input
sequence with both image information and text
information is then encoded by LSTM, identical
as in the text-only setting.

Transformer (TF) We also use the Transformer
architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) as baseline.
The text-only setup and image feature extraction
are identical to that of LSTM. For Transformer,
the image features are attached at the end of the
sequence of text embedding to form an image-

sition encoding is only applied on text embedding.
The input matrix ∈ R(len+5)×dim is then passed
into the Transformer as in the text-only setting.

4.2 Experimental Setup and Evaluation

Data Augmentation In order to obtain sufficient
training samples for neural models, we pair less-
edited stories with more-edited stories of the same
photo sequence to augment the data. In VIST-Edit,
five human-edited stories are collected for each
photo sequence. We use the human-edited sto-
ries that are less edited – measured by its Normal-
ized Damerau-Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein,
1966; Damerau, 1964) to the original story – as
the source and pair them with the stories that are
more edited (as the target.) This data augmenta-
tion strategy gives us in total fifteen (

training samples given five human-edited stories.

Human Evaluation Following the evaluation
procedure of the first VIST Challenge (Mitchell
et al., 2018), for each visual story, we recruit five
human judges on MTurk to rate it on six aspects (at
$0.1/HIT.) We take the average of the five judg-
ments as the final scores for the story. Table 2
shows the results. The LSTM using text-only in-
put outperforms all other baselines. It improves
all six aspects for stories by AREL, and improves
“Focus” and “Human-like” aspects for stories by
GLAC. These results demonstrate that a relatively
small set of human edits can be used to boost the
story quality of an existing large VIST model. Ta-
ble 2 also suggests that the quality of a post-edited
story is heavily decided by its pre-edited version.
Even after editing by human editors, AREL’s sto-
ries still do not achieve the quality of pre-edited
stories by GLAC. The inefficacy of image features
and Transformer model might be caused by the
small size of VIST-Edit. It also requires further

research to develop a post-editing model in a mul-
timodal context.

5 Discussion

Automatic evaluation scores do not reflect the
quality improvements. APE for MT has been
using automatic metrics, such as BLEU, to bench-
mark progress (Libovickỳ et al., 2016). However,
classic automatic evaluation metrics fail to capture
the signal in human judgments for the proposed
visual story post-editing task. We first use the
human-edited stories as references, but all the au-
tomatic evaluation metrics generate lower scores
when human judges give a higher rating (Table 3.)

Table 3: Average evaluation scores for AREL sto-
ries, using the human-edited stories as references. All
the automatic evaluation metrics generate lower scores
when human judges give a higher rating.

We then switch to use the human-written stories
(VIST test set) as references, but again, all the au-
tomatic evaluation metrics generate lower scores
even when the editing was done by human (Ta-
ble 4.)

Table 5: Spearman rank-order correlation ρ between
the automatic evaluation scores (sum of all six as-
pects) and human judgment. When comparing among
machine-edited stories (­ and °), among pre- and
post-edited stories (® and ±), or among any combina-
tions of them (², ³ and ´), all metrics result in weak
correlations with human judgments.

Table 5 further shows the Spearman rank-order
correlation ρ between the automatic evaluation
scores (sum of all six aspects) and human judg-
ment calculated using different data combination.
In row ¯ of Table 5, the reported correlation ρ of
METEOR is consistent with the findings in Huang
et al. (2016), which suggests that METEOR could
be useful when comparing among stories gener-
ated by the same visual storytelling model. How-
ever, when comparing among machine-edited sto-
ries (row ­ and °), among pre- and post-edited
stories (row ® and ±), or among any combina-
tions of them (row ², ³ and ´), all metrics re-
sult in weak correlations with human judgments.
These results strongly suggest the need of a new
automatic evaluation metric for visual story post-
editing task. Some new metrics have recently been
introduced using linguistic (Roemmele and Gor-

don, 2018a) or story features (Purdy et al., 2018)
to evaluate story automatically. More research is
needed to examine whether these metrics are use-
ful for story post-editing tasks too.

6 Conclusion

VIST-Edit, the first dataset for human edits
of machine-generated visual stories, is intro-
duced. We argue that human editing on machine-
generated stories is unavoidable, and such edited
data can be leveraged to enable automatic post-
editing. We have established baselines for the task
of visual story post-editing, and have motivated
the need for a new automatic evaluation metric.
