Abstract

Large amount of parallel corpora is re-
quired for building Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) systems. We describe
the TransDoop system for gathering trans-
lations to create parallel corpora from on-
line crowd workforce who have familiar-
ity with multiple languages but are not
expert translators. Our system uses a
Map-Reduce-like approach to translation
crowdsourcing where sentence translation
is decomposed into the following smaller
tasks: (a) translation of constituent phrases
of the sentence; (b) validation of qual-
ity of the phrase translations; and (c)
composition of complete sentence trans-
lations from phrase translations. Trans-
Doop incorporates quality control mech-
anisms and easy-to-use worker user in-
terfaces designed to address issues with
translation crowdsourcing. We have eval-
uated the crowd’s output using the ME-
TEOR metric. For a complex domain like
judicial proceedings, the higher scores ob-
tained by the map-reduce based approach
compared to complete sentence translation
establishes the efficacy of our work.

1 Introduction

Crowdsourcing is no longer a new term in the do-
main of Computational Linguistics and Machine
Translation research (Callison-Burch and Dredze,
2010; Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009).
Crowdsourcing - basically where task outsourcing
is delegated to a largely unknown Internet audi-
ence - is emerging as a new paradigm of human
in the loop approaches for developing sophisti-
cated techniques for understanding and generat-
ing natural language content. Amazon Mechanical

Turk(AMT) and CrowdFlower 1 are representative
general purpose crowdsourcing platforms where
as Lingotek and Gengo2 are companies targeted
at localization and translation of content typically
leveraging freelancers.

Our interest is towards developing a crowd-
sourcing based system to enable general, non-
expert crowd-workers generate natural language
content equivalent in quality to that of expert lin-
guists. Realization of the potential of attaining
great scalability and cost-benefit of crowdsourcing
for natural language tasks is limited by the abil-
ity of novice multi-lingual workers generate high
quality translations. We have specific interest in
Indian languages due to the large linguistic diver-
sity as well as the scarcity of linguistic resources in
these languages when compared to European lan-
guages. Crowdsourcing is a promising approach
as many Indian languages are spoken by hundreds
of Millions of people (approximately, Hindi-Urdu
by 500M, Bangla by 200M, Punjabi by over 100M
3) coupled with the fact that representation of In-
dian workers in online crowdsourcing platforms is
very high (close to 40% in Amazon Mechanical
Turk (AMT)).

However, this is a non-trivial task owing to lack
of expertise of novice crowd workers in transla-
tion of content. It is well understood that famil-
iarity with multiple languages might not be good
enough for people to generate high quality transla-
tions. This is compounded by lack of sincerity and
in certain cases, dishonest intention of earning re-
wards disproportionate to the effort and time spent
for online tasks. Common techniques for quality
control like gold data based validation and worker
reputation are not effective for a subjective task

like translation which does not have any task spe-
cific measurements. Having expert linguists man-
ually validate crowd generated content defies the
purpose of deploying crowdsourcing on a large
scale.

In this work, we propose a technique, based
on the Divide-and-Conquer principle. The tech-
nique can be considered similar to a Map-Reduce
task run on crowd processors, where the transla-
tion task is split into simpler tasks distributed to
the crowd (the map stage) and the results are later
combined in a reduce stage to generate complete
translations. The attempt is to make translation
tasks easy and intuitive for novice crowd-workers
by providing translations aids to help them gen-
erate high quality of translations. Our contribu-
tion in this work is a end-to-end, crowdsourcing-
platform-independent, translation crowdsourcing
system that completely automates the translation
crowdsourcing task by (i) managing the transla-
tion pipeline through software components and the
crowd; (ii) performing quality control on work-
ers’ output; and (iii) interfacing with crowdsourc-
ing service providers. The multi-stage, Map-
reduce approach simplifies the translation task for
crowd workers, while novel design of user inter-
face makes the task convenient for the worker and
discourages spamming. The system thus offers the
potential to generate high quality parallel corpora
on a large scale.

We discuss related work in Section 2 and the
multi-staged approach which is central to our sys-
tem in Section 3. Section 4 describes the sys-
tem architecture and workflow, while Section 5
presents important aspects of the user interfaces
in the system. We present our preliminary exper-
iments and observations in Section 6. Section 7
concludes the paper, pointing to future directions.

2 Related Work

Lately, crowdsourcing has been explored as a
source for generating data for NLP tasks (Snow
et al., 2008; Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).
Specifically, it has been explored as a channel for
collecting different resources for SMT - evalua-
tions of MT output (Callison-Burch, 2009), word
alignments in parallel sentences (Gao et al., 2010)
and post-edited versions of MT output (Aikawa et
al., 2012). Ambati and Vogel (2010), Kunchukut-
tan et al. (2012) have shown the feasibility of
crowdsourcing for collecting parallel corpora and

pointed out that quality assurance is a major issue
for successful translation crowdsourcing.

The most popular methods for quality control
of crowdsourced tasks are based on sampling and
redundancy. For translation crowdsourcing, Am-
bati et al. (2010) use inter-translator agreement for
selection of a good translation from multiple, re-
dundant worker translations. Zaidan and Callison-
Burch (2011) score translations using a feature
based model comprising sentence level, worker
level and crowd ranking based features. However,
automatic evaluation of translation quality is diffi-
cult, such automatic methods being either inaccu-
rate or expensive. Post et al. (2012) have collected
Indic language corpora data utilizing the crowd for
collecting translations as well as validations. The
quality of the validations is ensured using gold-
standard sentence translations. Our approach to
quality control is similar to Post et al. (2012), but
we work at the level of phrases.

While most crowdsourcing activities for data
gathering has been concerned with collecting sim-
ple annotations like relevance judgments, there has
been work to explore the use of crowdsourcing
for more complex tasks, of which translation is
a good example. Little et al. (2010) propose that
many complex tasks can be modeled either as iter-
ative workflows (where workers iteratively build
on each other’s works) or as parallel workflows
(where workers solve the tasks in parallel, with the
best result voted upon later). Kittur et al. (2011)
suggest a map-and-reduce approach to solve com-
plex problems, where a problem is decomposed
into smaller problems, which are solved in the map
stage and the results are combined in the reduce
stage. Our method can be seen as an instance
of the map-reduce approach applied to translation
crowdsourcing, with two map stages (phrase trans-
lation and translation validation) and one reduce
stage (sentence combination).

3 Multi-Stage Crowdsourcing Pipeline

Our system is based on a multi-stage pipeline,
whose central idea is to simplify the translation
task into smaller tasks. The high level block di-
agram of the system is shown in Figure 1. Source
language documents are sentencified using stan-
dard NLP tokenizers and sentence splitters. Ex-
tracted sentences are then split into phrases us-
ing a standard chunker and rule-based merging
of small chunks. This step creates small phrases

176



Figure 1: Multistage crowdsourced translation

from complex sentences which can be easily and
independently translated. This leads to a crowd-
sourcing pipeline, with three stages of tasks for the
crowd: Phrase Translation (PT), Phrase Transla-
tion Validation (PV), Sentence Composition (SC).
A group of crowd workers translate source lan-
guage phrases, the translations are validated by a
different group of workers and finally a third group
of workers put the phrase translation together to
create target language sentences. The validation
is done by workers by providing ratings on a k-
point scale. This kind of divide and conquer ap-
proach helps to tackle the complexity of crowd-
sourcing translations since: (1) the tasks are sim-
pler for workers; (2) uniformity of smaller tasks
brings about efficiency as in any industrial assem-
bly line; (3) pricing can be controlled for each
stage depending on the complexity; and (4) quality
control can be performed better for smaller tasks.

4 System Architecture

Figure 2 shows the architecture of TransDoop,
which implements the 3-stage pipeline. The major
design considerations were: (i) translation crowd-
sourcing pipeline should be independent of spe-
cific crowdsourcing platforms; (ii) support multi-
ple crowdsourcing platforms; (iii) customize job
parameters like pricing, quality control method
and task design; and (iv) support multiple lan-
guages and domains.

The core component in the system is the
Crowdsourcing Engine. The engine manages the
execution of the crowdsourcing pipeline, lifecycle
of jobs and quality control of submitted tasks. The
Engine exposes its capabilities through the Re-
quester API, which can be used by clients for
setting up, customizing and monitoring transla-
tion crowdsourcing jobs and controlling their exe-
cution. These capabilities are made available to

requesters via the Requester Portal. In order
to make the crowdsourcing engine independent
of any specific crowdsourcing platform, platform
specific Connectors are developed. The Crowd-
sourcing system makes the tasks to be crowd-
sourced available through the Connector API.
The connectors are responsible for polling the en-
gine for tasks to be crowdsourced, pushing the
tasks to crowdsourcing platforms, hosting worker
interfaces for the tasks and pushing the results
back to the engine after they have been completed
by workers on the crowdsourcing platform. Cur-
rently the system supports the AMT crowdsourc-
ing platform.

Figure 3 depicts the lifecycle of a translation
crowdsourcing job. The requester initiates a trans-
lation job for a document (a set of sentences). The
Crowdsourcing Engine schedules the job for exe-
cution. It first splits each sentence into phrases.
For the job, PT tasks are created and made avail-
able through the Connector API. The connector
for the specified platform periodically polls the
Crowdsourcing Engine via the Connector API.
Once the connector has new PT tasks for crowd-
sourcing, it interacts with the crowdsourcing plat-
form to request crowdsourcing services. The con-
nector monitors the progress of the tasks and on
completion provides the results and execution sta-
tus to the Crowdsourcing Engine. Once all the PT
tasks for the job are completed, the crowdsourcing
Engine initiates the PV task to obtain validations
for the translations. The Quality Control system
kicks in when all the PV tasks for the job have
been completed.

The quality control (QC) relies on a combina-
tion of sampling and redundancy. Each PV task
has a few gold-standard phrase translation pairs,
which is used to ensure that the validators are hon-
estly doing their tasks. The judgments from the

177

good validators are used to determine the quality
of the phrase translation, based on majority voting,
average rating, etc. using multiple judgments col-
lected for each phrase translation. If any phrase
validations or translations are incorrect, then the
corresponding phrases/translations are again sent
to the PT/PV stage as the case may be. This will
continue until all phrase translations in the job are
correctly translated or a pre-configured number of
iterations are done.

Once phrase translations are obtained for all
phrases in a sentence, the Crowdsourcing Engine
creates SC tasks, where the workers are asked
to compose a single correct, coherent translation
from the phrase translation obtained in the previ-
ous stages.

5 User Interfaces

5.1 Worker User Interfaces

This section describes the worker user interfaces
for each stage in the pipeline. These are man-
aged by the Connector and have been designed to
make the task convenient for the worker and pre-
vent spam submissions. In the rest of the section,
we describe the salient features of the PT and SC

UI’s. PV UI is similar to k-scale voting tasks com-
monly found in crowdsourcing platforms.

• Translation UI: Figure 4a shows the trans-
lation UI for the PT stage. The user in-
terface discourages spamming by: (a) dis-
playing source text as images; and (b) alert-
ing workers if they don’t provide a transla-
tion or spend very little time on a task. The
UI also provides transliteration support for
non-Latin scripts (especially helpful for Indic
scripts). A Vocabulary Support, which shows
translation suggestions for word sequences
appearing in the source phrase, is also avail-
able. Suggested translations can be copied to
the input area with ease and speed.

• Sentence Translation Composition UI: The
sentence translation composition UI (shown
in Figure 4b) facilitates composition of sen-
tence translations from phrase translations.
First, the worker can drag and rearrange the
translated phrases into the right order, fol-
lowed by reordering of individual words.
This is important because many Indian lan-
guages have different constituent order ( S-O-
V) with respect to English (S-V-O). Finally,
the synthesized language sentence can be
post-edited to correct spelling, case marking,
inflectional errors, etc. The system also cap-
tures the reordering performed by the worker,
an important byproduct, which can be used
for training reordering models for SMT.

5.2 Requester UI

The system provides a Requester Portal through
which the requester can create, control and mon-
itor jobs and retrieve results. The portal allows
the requester to customize the job during creation
by configuring various parameters: (a) domain
and language pair (b) entire sentence vs multi-
stage translation (c) price for task at each stage
(d) task design (number of tasks in a task group,
etc.) (e) translation redundancy (f) validation qual-
ity parameters. Translation redundancy refers to
the number of translations requested for a source
phrase. Validation redundancy refers to the num-
ber of validations collected for each phrase trans-
lation pair and the redundancy based acceptance
criteria for phrase translations (majority, consen-
sus, threshold, etc.)

6 Experiments and Observations

Using TransDoop, we conducted a set of small-
scale, preliminary translation experiments. We ob-
tained translations for English-Hindi and English-
Marathi language pairs for the Judicial and
Tourism domains. For each experiment, 15 sen-
tences were given as input to the pipeline. For
evaluation, we chose METEOR, a well-known
translation evaluation metric (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005). We compared the results obtained from the
crowdsourcing system with a expert human trans-
lation and the output of Google Translate. We also
compared two expert translations using METEOR
to establish a skyline for the translation accuracy.
Table 1 summarizes the results of our experiments.

The translations with Quality Control and mul-
tistage pipeline are better than Google translations
and translations obtained from the crowd without
any quality control, as evaluated by METEOR.
Multi-stage translation yields better than complete
sentence translation. Moreover, the translation
quality is comparable to that of expert human
translation. This behavior is observed across the
two language pairs and domains. This can be seen
in some examples of crowdsourced translations
obtained through the system which are shown in
Table 2.

Incorrect splitting of sentences can cause diffi-
culties in translation for the worker. For instance,
discontinuous phrases will not be available to the
worker as a single translation unit. In the English
interrogative sentence, the noun phrase splits the
verb phrase, therefore the auxiliary and main verb
could be in different translation units. e.g.

Why did you buy the book?

In addition, the phrase structures of the source

and target languages may not map, making trans-
lation difficult. For instance, the vaala modifier in
Hindi translates to a clause in English. It does not
contain any tense information, therefore the tense
of the English clause cannot be determined by the
worker. e.g.

Lucknow vaalaa ladkaa
could translate to any one of:

the boy who lives/lived/is living in Lucknow
We rely on the worker in sentence composition

stage to correct mistakes due to these inadequacies
and compose a good translation. In addition, the
worker in the PT stage could be provided with the
sentence context for translation. However, there
is a tradeoff between the cognitive load of context
processing versus uncertainty in translation. More
elaborately, to what extent can the cognitive load
be reduced before uncertainty of translation sets
in? Similarly, how much of context can be shown
before the cognitive load becomes pressing?

7 Conclusions

In this system demonstration, we present Trans-
Doop as a translation crowdsourcing system which
has the potential to harness the strength of the
crowd to collect high quality human translations
on a large scale. It simplifies the tedious trans-
lation tasks by decomposing them into several
“easy-to-solve” subtasks while ensuring quality.
Our evaluation on small scale data shows that
the multistage approach performs better than com-
plete sentence translation. We would like to exten-
sively use this platform for large scale experiments
on more language pairs and complex domains like
Health, Parliamentary Proceedings, Technical and
Scientific literature etc. to establish the utility of
