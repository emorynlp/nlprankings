Abstract

We present a probabilistic generative
model for learning semantic parsers from
ambiguous supervision. Our approach
learns from natural language sentences
paired with world states consisting of
multiple potential logical meaning repre-
sentations.
It disambiguates the mean-
ing of each sentence while simultane-
ously learning a semantic parser that maps
sentences into logical form. Compared
to a previous generative model for se-
mantic alignment,
it also supports full
semantic parsing. Experimental results
on the Robocup sportscasting corpora in
both English and Korean indicate that
our approach produces more accurate se-
mantic alignments than existing methods
and also produces competitive semantic
parsers and improved language genera-
tors.

Introduction

1
Most approaches to learning semantic parsers that
map sentences into complete logical forms (Zelle
and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins,
2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Wong and
Mooney, 2007b; Lu et al., 2008) require fully-
supervised corpora that provide full formal logi-
cal representations for each sentence. Such cor-
pora are expensive and difﬁcult to construct. Sev-
eral recent projects on “grounded” language learn-
ing (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen and Mooney,
2008; Chen et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2009) exploit
more easily and naturally available training data
consisting of sentences paired with world states

consisting of multiple potential semantic repre-
sentations. This setting is partially motivated by a
desire to model how children naturally learn lan-
guage in the context of a rich, ambiguous percep-
tual environment.

In particular, Chen and Mooney (2008) in-
troduced the problem of learning to sportscast
by simply observing natural language commen-
tary on simulated Robocup robot soccer games.
The training data consists of natural language
(NL) sentences ambiguously paired with logical
meaning representations (MRs) describing recent
events in the game extracted from the simulator.
Most sentences describe one of the extracted re-
cent events; however, the speciﬁc event to which
it refers is unknown. Therefore, the learner has
to ﬁgure out the correct matching (alignment) be-
tween NL and MR before inducing a semantic
parser or language generator. Based on an ap-
proach introduced by Kate and Mooney (2007),
Chen and Mooney (2008) repeatedly retrain both
a supervised semantic parser and language gener-
ator using an iterative algorithm analogous to Ex-
pectation Maximization (EM). However, this ap-
proach is somewhat ad hoc and does not exploit
a well-deﬁned probabilistic generative model or
real EM training.

On the other hand, Liang et al. (2009) in-
troduced a probabilistic generative model for
learning semantic correspondences in ambigu-
ous training data consisting of sentences paired
with observed world states. Compared to Chen
and Mooney (2008), they demonstrated improved
alignment results on Robocup sportscasting data.
However, their model only produces an NL–MR
alignment and does not learn either an effective

544

semantic parser or language generator.
In addi-
tion, they use a combination of a simple Markov
model and a bag-of-words model when generating
natural language for MRs, therefore, they do not
model context-free linguistic syntax.

Motivated by the limitations of these previ-
ous methods, we propose a new generative align-
ment model that includes a full semantic pars-
ing model proposed by Lu et al. (2008). Our
approach is capable of disambiguating the map-
ping between language and meanings while also
learning a complete semantic parser for mapping
sentences to logical form. Experimental results
on Robocup sportscasting show that our approach
outperforms all previous results on the NL–MR
matching (alignment) task and also produces com-
petitive performance on semantic parsing and im-
proved language generation.

2 Related Work
The conventional approach to learning seman-
tic parsers (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Ge and
Mooney, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Zettle-
moyer and Collins, 2007; Zettlemoyer and
Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2007b; Lu et
al., 2008) requires detailed supervision unambigu-
ously pairing each sentence with its logical form.
However, developing training corpora for these
methods requires expensive expert human labor.

Chen and Mooney (2008) presented methods
for grounded language learning from ambigu-
ous supervision that address three related tasks:
NL–MR alignment, semantic parsing, and natu-
ral language generation. They solved the prob-
lem of aligning sentences and meanings by iter-
atively retraining an existing supervised seman-
tic parser, WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2007b) or
KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006), or an existing
supervised natural-language generator, WASP−1
(Wong and Mooney, 2007a). During each iter-
ation, the currently trained parser (generator) is
used to produce an improved NL–MR alignment
that is used to retrain the parser (generator) in the
next iteration. However, this approach does not
use the power of a probabilistic correspondence
between an NL and MRs during training.

On the other hand, Liang et al. (2009) pro-
posed a probabilistic generative approach to pro-

duce a Viterbi alignment between NL and MRs.
They use a hierarchical semi-Markov generative
model that ﬁrst determines which facts to dis-
cuss and then generates words from the predi-
cates and arguments of the chosen facts. They re-
port improved matching accuracy in the Robocup
sportscasting domain. However, they only ad-
dressed the alignment problem and are unable to
parse new sentences into meaning representations
or generate natural language from logical forms.
In addition, the model uses a weak bag-of-words
assumption when estimating links between NL
segments and MR facts. Although it does use a
simple Markov model to order the generation of
the different ﬁelds of an MR record, it does not
utilize the full syntax of the NL or MR or their
relationship.

Chen et al. (2010) recently reported results
on utilizing the improved alignment produced by
Liang et al. (2009)’s model to initialize their own
iterative retraining method. By combining the ap-
proaches, they produced more accurate NL–MR
alignments and improved semantic parsers.

Motivated by this prior research, our approach
combines the generative alignment model of
Liang et al. (2009) with the generative semantic
parsing model of Lu et al. (2008) in order to fully
exploit the NL syntax and its relationship to the
MR semantics. Therefore, unlike Liang et al.’s
simple Markov + bag-of-words model for gener-
ating language, it uses a tree-based model to gen-
erate grammatical NL from structured MR facts.

3 Background
This section describes existing models and algo-
rithms employed in the current research. Our
model is built on top of the generative semantic
parsing model developed by Lu et al. (2008). Af-
ter learning a probabilistic alignment and parsing
model, we also used the WASP and WASP−1 sys-
tems to produce additional parsing and generation
results. In particular, since our current system is
incapable of effectively generating NL sentences
from MR logical forms, in order to demonstrate
how our matching results can aid NL generation,
we use WASP−1 to learn a generator. This follows
the experimental scheme of Chen et al. (2010),
which demonstrated that an improved NL–MR

matching from Liang et al. (2009) results in better
overall parsing and generation. Finally, our over-
all generative model uses the IGSL (Iterative Gen-
eration Strategy Learning) method of Chen and
Mooney (2008) to initially estimate the prior prob-
ability of each event-type generating a natural-
language comment.

3.1 Generative Semantic Parsing
Lu et al. (2008) introduced a generative seman-
tic parsing model using a hybrid-tree framework.
A hybrid tree is deﬁned over a pair, (w, m), of a
natural-language sentence and its logical meaning
representation. The tree expresses a correspon-
dence between word segments in the NL and the
grammatical structure of the MR. In a hybrid tree,
MR production rules constitute the internal nodes,
while NL words (or phrases) constitute the leaves.
A sample hybrid tree from the English Robocup
data is given in Figure 1.

A generative model based on hybrid trees is de-
ﬁned as follows: starting from a root semantic
category, the model generates a production of the
MR grammar, and then subsequently generates a
mixed hybrid pattern of NL words and child se-
mantic categories. This process is repeated un-
til all leaves in the hybrid tree are NL words (or
phrases). Each generation step is only dependent
on the parent step, thus, generation is assumed to
be a Markov process.

Lu et al. (2008)’s generative parsing model es-
timates the joint probability P (T , w, m), which
represents the probability of generating a hybrid
tree T with NL w, and MR m. This probability
is computed as the product of the probabilities of
the steps in the generative process. Since there are

multiple ways to construct a hybrid tree given a
pair of NL and MR, the data likelihood of the pair
(w, m) given by the learned model is calculated
by summing P (T , w, m) over all the possible hy-
brid trees for NL w and MR m.
The model is normally trained in a fully su-
pervised setting using NL–MR pairs. In order to
learn from ambiguous supervision, we extend this
model to include an additional generative process
for selecting the subset of available MRs used to
generate NL sentences.

3.2 WASP and WASP−1
WASP (Word-Alignment-based Semantic Parsing)
is a semantic parsing system that uses syntax-
based statistical machine translation techniques. It
induces a probabilistic synchronous context-free
grammar (PSCFG) for generating corresponding
NL–MR pairs. Since a PSCFG is symmetric
with respect to the two languages it generates,
the same learned model can be used for both se-
mantic parsing (mapping NL to MR) and natural
language generation (mapping MR to NL), Since
there is no prespeciﬁed formal grammar for the
NL, the WASP−1 system learns an n-gram lan-
guage model for the NL side and uses it to choose
the most probable NL translation for a given MR
using a noisy-channel model.

IGSL

3.3
Chen and Mooney (2008) introduced the IGSL
method for determining which event types a hu-
man commentator is more likely to describe in
natural language. This is sometimes called strate-
gic generation or content selection, the process of
choosing what to say; as opposed to tactical gen-
eration, which determines how to say it.
IGSL
uses a method analogous to EM to train on am-
biguously supervised data and iteratively improve
probability estimates for each event type, speci-
fying how likely each MR predicate is to elicit
a comment. The algorithm alternates between
two processes: calculating the expected proba-
bility of an NL–MR matching based on the cur-
rently learned estimates, and updating the prob-
ability of each event type based on the expected
match counts. IGSL was shown to be quite effec-
tive at predicting which events in a Robocup game

model, we use IGSL probability scores as initial
priors for our event selection model.

4 Evaluation Dataset
In our experiments, we use the Robocup
sportscasting data produced by Chen et al. (2010),
which includes both English and Korean com-
mentaries. The data was collected by having both
English and Korean speakers commentate the ﬁ-
nal games from the RoboCup simulation soccer
league for each year from 2001 through 2004. Ta-
ble 1 presents some statistics on this sportscasting
data. To construct the ambiguous training data,
each NL commentary sentence is paired with MRs
for all extracted simulation events that occurred in
the previous 5 seconds (an average of 2.5 events).
Figure 2 shows a sample trace from the
Robocup English data. Each NL commentary sen-
tence normally has several possible MR matches
that occurred within the 5-second window, in-
dicated by edges between the NL and MR.
Bold edges represent gold standard matches con-
structed solely for evaluation purposes. Note that
not every NL has a gold matching MR. This oc-
curs because the sentence refers to unrecognized
or undetected events or situations or because the
matching MR lies outside the 5-second window.

5 Generative Model
Like Liang et al. (2009)’s generative alignment
model, our model is designed to estimate P (w|s),
where w is an NL sentence and s is a world state
containing a set of possible MR logical forms that
can be matched to w. However, our approach
is intended to support both determining the most
likely match between an NL and its MR in its
world state, and semantic parsing, i.e. ﬁnding the

data.

most probable mapping from a given NL sentence
to an MR logical form.

Our generative model consists of two stages:
• Event selection: P (e|s), chooses the event e

in the world state s to be described.

• Natural language generation: P (w|e), mod-
els the probability of generating natural-
language sentence w from the MR speciﬁed
by event e.

5.1 Event selection model
The event selection model speciﬁes the probabil-
ity distribution for picking an event that is likely
to be commented upon amongst the multiple MR
logical forms in the world state s. The probabil-
ity of picking an event is assumed to depend only
on its event type as given by the predicate of its
MR. For example, the MR pass(pink10, pink11)
has event type pass and arguments pink10 and
pink11.

Our model is similar to Liang et al. (2009)’s
record choice model, but we only model their no-
tion of salience, denoting that some event types
are more likely to be described than others. We do
not model their notion of coherence, which mod-
els the order of event types in the commentary. We
found that for sportscasting the order of described
events depends only on the sequence of events in
the game and does not exhibit any additional de-
tectable pattern due to linguistic preferences.

The probability of picking an event e of type te
is denoted by p(te). If there are multiple events
of type t in a world state s, then an event of type
t is selected uniformly from the set s(t) of events

5.2 Natural language generation model

The natural-language generation model deﬁnes
the probability distribution of NL sentences given
an MR speciﬁed by the previously selected event.
We use Lu et al. (2008)’s generative model for this
step, in which:

P (w|e) = X∀T over (w,m)

P (T , w|m)

(2)

where m is the MR logical form deﬁned by event
e and T is a hybrid tree deﬁned over the NL–MR
pair (w, m).
The probability P (T , w|m) is calculated using
the generative semantic parsing model of Lu et al.
(2008) using the joint probability of the NL–MR
pair (w, m), i.e. the inside probability of gener-
ating (w, m). The likelihood of a sentence w is
then the sum over all possible hybrid trees deﬁned
by the NL–MR pair (w, m). 1

The natural language generation model covers
the roles of both the ﬁeld choice model and word
choice models of Liang et al. (2009). Since our
event selection model only chooses an event based
on its type, the order of its arguments still needs
to be addressed. However, Lu et al.’s generative
model includes ordering the MR arguments (as
speciﬁed by MR production rules) as well as the
generation of NL words and phrases to express
these arguments. Thus, it is unnecessary to sepa-
rately model argument ordering in our approach.2

1Lu et al. (2008) propose 3 models for generative seman-
tic parsing: unigram, bigram, and mixgram (interpolation be-
tween the two). We used the bigram model, where the gen-
eration of a hybrid-tree component (NL word or semantic
category) depends on the previously generated component as
well as the parent MR production. The bigram model always
performed the best on all tasks in our experimental evalua-
tion.

2We also tried using a Markov model to order arguments
like Liang et al. (2009), but preliminary experimental results
showed that this additional component actually decreased
performance rather than improving it.

6 Learning and Inference
This composite generative model is trained using
conventional EM methods. The process is similar
to Lu et al. (2008)’s, an inside-outside style al-
gorithm using dynamic programming to generate
a hybrid tree from the NL–MR pair (w, m), ex-
cept our model’s estimation process additionally
deals with calculating expected counts under the
posterior P (e|w, s; θ) in the E-step and normaliz-
ing the counts to optimize parameters. The whole
process is quite efﬁcient; training time takes about
30 minutes to run on sportscasts of three games in
either English or Korean.

Unfortunately, we found that EM tended to get
stuck at local maxima with respect to learning the
event-type selection probabilities, p(t). There-
fore, we also tried initializing these parameters
with the corresponding strategic generation values
learned by the IGSL method of Chen and Mooney
(2008). Since IGSL was shown to be quite effec-
tive at predicting which event types were likely to
be described, the use of IGSL priors provides a
good starting point for our event selection model.
Our model is built on top of Lu et al. (2008)’s
generative semantic parsing model, which is also
trained in several steps in its best-performing ver-
sion.3 Thus, the overall model is vulnerable to
getting stuck in local optima when running EM
across these multiple steps. We also tried using
random restarts with different initialization of pa-
rameters, but initializing with IGSL priors per-
formed the best in our experimental evaluation.

7 Experimental Evaluation
We evaluated our proposed model on the Robocup
sportscasting data described in Section 4. Our ex-
perimental results cover 3 tasks: NL–MR match-
ing, semantic parsing, and tactical generation.
Following Chen and Mooney (2008), the exper-
iments were conducted using 4-fold (leave one
game out) cross validation. Since the corpus con-
tains data for four separate games, each fold uses
3 games for training and the remaining game for

3The bigram model of Lu et al. (2008), which is the one
used in this paper, must be trained using parameters previ-
ously learned for the IBM Model 1 and unigram model in
order to exhibit the best performance. We followed the same
training scheme in our version.

548

testing for semantic parsing and tactical genera-
tion. Matching performance is measured in train-
ing data, since the goal is to disambiguate this
data. All results are averaged across these 4 folds.
We also use the same performance metrics
as Chen and Mooney (2008). The accuracy of
matching and semantic parsing are measured us-
ing F-measure, the harmonic mean of precision
and recall, where precision is the fraction of the
system’s annotations that are correct, and recall
is the fraction of the annotations from the gold-
standard that the system correctly produces. Gen-
eration is evaluated using BLEU score (Papineni
et al., 2002) between generated sentences and ref-
erence NL sentences in the test set. We com-
pare our results to previous results from Chen and
Mooney (2008) and Chen et al. (2010) and to
matching results on Robocup data from Liang et
al. (2009).

7.1 NL–MR Matching
The goal of matching is to ﬁnd the most probable
NL–MR alignment for ambiguous examples con-
sisting of an NL sentence and multiple potential
MR logical forms. In Robocup sportscasting, the
MRs for a given sentence correspond to all game
events that occur within a 5-second window prior
to the NL comment. Not all NL sentences have a
matching MR in this window, but most do. Dur-
ing testing, an NL w is matched to an MR m if
and only if the learned semantic parser produces
m as the most probable parse of w. Thus, our
model does not force every NL to match an MR.
If the most probable semantic parse of a sentence
does not match any of the possible recent events,
it is simply left unmatched. Matching is evaluated
against the gold-standard matches supplied with
the data, which are used for evaluation purposes
only. The gold matching data is never used during
training.

Table 2 shows the detailed results for both
English and Korean data.4 Our best approach
outperforms all previous methods for both En-
glish and Korean by quite large margins. Note

4Since the Korean data was not yet available for use by
either Chen and Mooney (2008) or Liang et al. (2009), we
present the results reported by Chen et al. (2010) for these
methods.

that initializing our EM training with IGSL’s es-
timates improves performance signiﬁcantly, and
this approach outperforms Chen et al. (2010)’s
best method, which also uses IGSL.

In particular, our proposed model outperforms
the generative alignment model of Liang et al.
(2009), indicating that the extra linguistic infor-
mation and MR grammatical structure used by Lu
et al. (2008)’s generative language model make
our overall model more effective than a simple
Markov + bag-of-words model for language gen-
eration.

7.2 Semantic Parsing
Semantic parsing is evaluated by determining how
accurately NL sentences in the test set are cor-
rectly mapped to their meaning representations.
Results are presented in Table 3.5
6 For our
model, we report results using the parser learned
directly from the ambiguous supervision, as well

WASPER-GEN, and that of Chen et al. (2010) is for WASPER
with Liang et al.’s matching initialization for English and for

for Korean.

as results for training a supervised parser (both
WASP and Lu et al. (2009)’s) on the NL–MR
matching produced by our model. We also present
results for training Lu et al.’s parser and WASP on
Liang et al.’s NL–MR matchings.

Our initial learned semantic parser does not per-
form better than the best results reported by Chen
et al. (2010), but it is clearly better than the ini-
tial results of Chen and Mooney (2008). Train-
ing WASP and Lu et al.’s supervised parser on
our method’s highly accurate set of disambiguated
NL–MR pairs improved the results. Retraining Lu
et al.’s parser gave the best overall results for En-
glish, and retraining WASP gave the second high-
est results for Korean, only failing to beat the very
best results of Chen et al. (2010). It is somewhat
surprising that simply retraining on the hardened
set of most probable NL–MR matches gives bet-
ter results than the parser trained using EM, which
actually exploits the uncertainty in the underly-
ing matches. Further investigations of this phe-
nomenon are indicated.

Comparing with the corresponding results for
training WASP and Lu et al.’s supervised parser
on the NL–MR matchings produced by Liang et
al.’s alignment method, it is clear that our match-
ings produce more accurate semantic parsers ex-
cept when training WASP on English.

7.3 Tactical Generation
Tactical generation is evaluated based on how
well the learned model generates accurate NL sen-
tences from MR logical forms. Without integrat-
ing a language model for the NL, the existing
generative model is not very effective for tactical
generation. Lu et al. (2009) introduced an effec-
tive language generator for the hybrid tree frame-
work using a Tree-CRF model; however, we did
not have access to this system. Therefore, for
tactical generation, we used the publicly avail-
able WASP−1 system (Wong and Mooney, 2007a)
trained on disambiguated NL–MR matches. This
approach also allows direct comparison with the
results of Chen and Mooney (2008) and Chen et
al. (2010), who also used WASP−1 for tactical
generation. Our objective is to show that the more
accurate matchings produced by our generative
model can improve tactical generation.

The results are shown in Table 4.7 8 Overall,
WASP−1 trained on the NL–MR matching from
our alignment model performs better than all pre-
vious methods. In particular, using the matchings
from our method to train WASP−1 produces bet-
ter tactical generators than using matchings from
Liang et al.’s approach.

7.4 Discussion
Overall, our model performs particularly well at
matching NL and MRs under ambiguous supervi-
sion, and the difference is larger for English than
Korean. However, improved matching results do
not necessarily translate into signiﬁcantly better
semantic parsers. For English, the improvement
in matching is almost 10 percentage points in F-
measure, but the semantic parsing result trained
with this more accurate matching shows only 1
point improvement.

Compared to Liang et al. (2009), our more ac-
curate (i.e. higher F-measure) matchings provide
a clear improvement in both semantic parsing and
tactical generation. The only exception is English
parsing using WASP, which seems to be due to
some misleading noise in our alignments. WASP
seems to be affected more than Lu et al.’s system
by such extraneous noise. However, in tactical
generation, this extraneous noise does not seem to
lead to worse performance, and our approach al-
ways gives the best results. As discussed by Chen
and Mooney (2008) and Chen et al. (2010), tac-
tical generation is somewhat easier than seman-
tic parsing in that semantic parsing needs to learn
7The best result of Chen and Mooney (2008) is for
WASPER-GEN, and that of Chen et al. (2010) is for WASPER
with Liang et al.’s matching initialization for English and for
WASER-GEN with Liang et al. initialization for Korean.

results with IGSL initialization.

to map a variety of synonymous natural-language
expressions to the same meaning representation,
while tactical generation only needs to learn one
way to produce a correct natural language descrip-
tion of an event. This difference in the nature of
semantic parsing and tactical generation may be
the cause of the different trends in the results.

8 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented a novel generative model capa-
ble of probabilistically aligning natural-language
sentences to their correct meaning representa-
tions given the ambiguous supervision provided
by a grounded language acquisition scenario. Our
model is also capable of simultaneously learning
to semantically parse NL sentences into their cor-
responding meaning representations. Experimen-
tal results in Robocup sportscasting show that the
NL–MR matchings inferred by our model are sig-
niﬁcantly more accurate than those produced by
all previous methods. Our approach also learns
competitive semantic parsers and improved lan-
guage generators compared to previous methods.
In particular, we showed that our alignments pro-
vide a better foundation for learning accurate se-
mantic parsers and tactical generators compared
to those of Liang et al. (2009), whose genera-
tive model is limited by a simple bag-of-words as-
sumption.

In the future, we plan to test our model on
more complicated data with higher degrees of am-
biguity as well as more complex meaning repre-
sentations. One immediate direction is evaluat-
ing our approach on the datasets of weather fore-
casts and NFL football articles used by Liang et al.
(2009). However, our current model does not sup-
port matching multiple meaning representations
to the same natural-language sentence, and needs
to be extended to allow multiple MRs to generate
a single NL sentence.
