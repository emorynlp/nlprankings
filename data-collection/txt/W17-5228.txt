Abstract

The paper describes experiments on esti-
mating emotion intensity in tweets using
a generalized regressor system. The sys-
tem combines lexical, syntactic and pre-
trained word embedding features, trains
them on general regressors and finally
combines the best performing models to
create an ensemble. The proposed sys-
tem stood 3rd out of 22 systems in the
leaderboard of WASSA-2017 Shared Task
on Emotion Intensity.

1 Introduction

Twitter, a micro-blogging and social networking
site has emerged as a platform where people ex-
press themselves and react to events in real-time.
It is estimated that nearly 500 million tweets are
sent per day 1. Twitter data is particularly inter-
esting because of its peculiar nature where people
convey messages in short sentences using hash-
tags, emoticons, emojis etc. In addition, each
tweet has meta data like location and language
used by the sender. It’s challenging to analyze this
data because the tweets might not be grammati-
cally correct and the users tend to use informal and
slang words all the time. Hence, this poses an in-
teresting problem for NLP researchers. Any ad-
vances in using this abundant and diverse data can
help understand and analyze information about a
person, an event, a product, an organization or a
country as a whole. Many notable use cases of the
twitter can be found here2.

Along the similar lines, The Task 1 of WASSA-
2017 (Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez, 2017c)
poses a problem of finding emotion intensity of

four emotions namely anger, fear, joy, sadness
from tweets. In this paper, we describe our ap-
proach and experiments to solve this problem. The
rest of the paper is laid out as follows: Section
2 describes the system architecture, Section 3 re-
ports results and inference from different exper-
iments, while Section 4 points to ways that the
problem can be further explored.

2 System Description

2.1 Preprocessing
The preprocessing step modifies the raw tweets
before they are passed to feature extraction.
Tweets are processed using tweetokenize tool3.
Twitter specific features are replaced as follows:
username handles to USERNAME, phone numbers
to PHONENUMBER, numbers to NUMBER, URLs
to URL and times to TIME. A continuous sequence
of emojis is broken into individual tokens. Finally,
all tokens are converted to lowercase.

2.2 Feature Extraction
Many tasks related to sentiment or emotion anal-
ysis depend upon affect, opinion, sentiment, sense
and emotion lexicons. These lexicons associate
words to corresponding sentiment or emotion met-
rics. On the other hand, the semantic meaning
of words, sentences, and documents are preserved

and compactly represented using low dimensional
vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013) instead of one hot
encoding vectors which are sparse and high di-
mensional. Finally, there are traditional NLP fea-
tures like word N-grams, character N-grams, Part-
Of-Speech N-grams and word clusters which are
known to perform well on various tasks.

Based on these observations, the feature ex-
traction step is implemented as a union of differ-
ent independent feature extractors (featurizers) in
a light-weight and easy to use Python program
EmoInt 4. It comprises of all features available
in the baseline model (Mohammad and Bravo-
Marquez, 2017a) 5 along with additional feature
extractors and bi-gram support. Fourteen such fea-
ture extractors have been implemented which can
be clubbed into 3 major categories:

• Lexicon Features
• Word Vectors
• Syntax Features

Lexicon Features: AFINN (Nielsen, 2011)
word list are manually rated for valence with an
integer between -5 (Negative Sentiment) and +5
(Positive Sentiment). Bing Liu (Hu and Liu, 2004)
opinion lexicon extract opinion on customer re-
views. +/-EffectWordNet (Choi and Wiebe, 2014)
by MPQA group are sense level lexicons. The
NRC Affect Intensity (Mohammad, 2017) lexi-
cons provide real valued affect intensity. NRC
Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad
and Turney, 2010) contains 8 sense level asso-
ciations (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise,
sadness, joy, and disgust) and 2 sentiment level
associations (negative and positive). Expanded
NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Bravo-
Marquez et al., 2016) expands the NRC word-
emotion association lexicon for twitter specific
language. NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon (Mo-
hammad and Kiritchenko, 2015) contains emotion
word associations computed on emotion labeled
twitter corpus via Hashtags. NRC Hashtag Sen-
timent Lexicon and Sentiment140 Lexicon (Mo-
hammad et al., 2013) contains sentiment word as-
sociations computed on twitter corpus via Hash-
tags and Emoticons. SentiWordNet (Baccianella
et al., 2010) assigns to each synset of WordNet

AffectiveTweets

three sentiment scores: positivity, negativity, ob-
jectivity. Negation lexicons collections are used to
count the total occurrence of negative words. In
addition to these, SentiStrength (Thelwall et al.,
2010) application which estimates the strength of
positive and negative sentiment from tweets is also
added.

Word Vectors: We focus primarily on the word
vector representations (word embeddings) created
specifically using the twitter dataset. GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) is an unsupervised learn-
ing algorithm for obtaining vector representations
for words. 200-dimensional GloVe embeddings
trained on 2 Billion tweets are integrated. Edin-
burgh embeddings (Bravo-Marquez et al., 2015)
are obtained by training skip-gram model on Edin-
burgh corpus (Petrovic et al., 2010). Since tweets
are abundant with emojis, Emoji embeddings (Eis-
ner et al., 2016) which are learned from the emoji
descriptions have been used. Embeddings for each
tweet are obtained by summing up individual word
vectors and then dividing by the number of tokens
in the tweet.

Syntactic Features: Syntax specific features
such as Word N-grams, Part-Of-Speech N-grams
(Owoputi et al., 2013), Brown Cluster N-grams
(Brown et al., 1992) obtained using TweetNLP 6

project have been integrated into the system.
The final feature vector is the concatenation of

all the individual features. For example, we con-
catenate average word vectors, sum of NRC Af-
fect Intensities, number of positive and negative
Bing Liu lexicons, number of negation words and
so on to get final feature vector. The scaling of
final features is not required when used with gra-
dient boosted trees. However, scaling steps like
standard scaling (zero mean and unit normal) may
be beneficial for neural networks as the optimizers
work well when the data is centered around origin.

A total of fourteen different feature extractors
have been implemented, all of which can be en-
abled or disabled individually to extract features
from a given tweet.

2.3 Regression

The dev data set (Mohammad and Bravo-
Marquez, 2017b) in the competition was small
hence, the train and dev sets were merged to per-
form 10-fold cross validation. On each fold, a
model was trained and the predictions were col-

6http://www.cs.cmu.edu/˜ark/TweetNLP/

206



lected on the remaining dataset. The predictions
are averaged across all the folds to generalize the
solution and prevent over-fitting. As described in
Section 2.2, different combinations of feature ex-
tractors were used. After performing feature ex-
traction, the data was then passed to various re-
gressors Support Vector Regression, AdaBoost,
RandomForestRegressor, and, BaggingRegressor
of sklearn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Finally, the
chosen top performing models had the least error
on evaluation metrics namely Pearson’s Correla-
tion Coefficient and Spearman’s rank-order corre-
lation.

2.4 Parameter Optimization

In order to find the optimal parameter values
for the EmoInt system, an extensive grid search
was performed through the scikit-Learn frame-
work over all subsets of the training set (shuf-
fled), using stratified 10-fold cross validation and
optimizing the Pearson’s Correlation score. Best
cross-validation results were obtained using Ad-
aBoost meta regressor with base regressor as XG-
Boost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) with 1000 es-
timators and 0.1 learning rate. Experiments and
analysis of results are presented in the next sec-
tion.

3 Results and Analysis

3.1 Experimental Results

As described in Section 2.2 various syntax features
were used namely, Part-of-Speech tags, brown
clusters of TweetNLP project. However, these
didn’t perform well in cross validation. Hence,
they were dropped from the final system. While
performing grid-search as mentioned in Section
2.4, keeping all the lexicon based features same,
choice of combination of emoji vector and word
vectors are varied to minimize cross validation
metric. Table 1 describes the results for exper-
iments conducted with different combinations of
word vectors. Emoji embeddings (Eisner et al.,
2016) give better results than using plain GloVe
and Edinburgh embeddings. Edinburgh embed-
dings outperform GloVe embeddings in Joy and
Sadness category but lag behind in Anger and
Fear category. The official submission comprised
of the top-performing model for each emotion cat-
egory. This system ranked 3rd for the entire test
dataset and 2nd for the subset of the test data
formed by taking every instance with a gold emo-

tion intensity score greater than or equal to 0.5.
Post competition, experiments were performed on
ensembling diverse models for improving the ac-
curacy. An ensemble obtained by averaging the re-
sults of the top 2 performing models outperforms
all the individual models.

3.2 Feature Importance
The relative feature importance can be assessed
by the relative depth of the feature used as a de-
cision node in the tree. Features used at the top
of the tree contribute to the final prediction deci-
sion of a larger fraction of the input samples. The
expected fraction of the samples they contribute
to can thus be used as an estimate of the relative
importance of the features. By averaging the mea-
sure over several randomized trees, the variance of
the estimate can be reduced and used as a measure
of relative feature importance. In Figure 2 fea-
ture importance graphs are plotted for each emo-
tion to infer which features are playing the major
role in identifying emotional intensity in tweets.
+/-EffectWordNet (Choi and Wiebe, 2014), NRC
Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, Sentiment140 Lexi-
con (Mohammad et al., 2013) and NRC Hashtag
Emotion Lexicon (Mohammad and Kiritchenko,
2015) are playing the most important role.

3.3 System Limitations
It is important to understand how the model per-
forms in different scenarios. Table 2 analyzes
when the system performs the best and worst for
each emotion. Since the features used are mostly
lexicon based, the system has difficulties in cap-
turing the overall sentiment and it leads to ampli-
fying or vanishing intensity signals. For instance,
in example 4 of fear louder and shaking lexicons
imply fear but overall sentence doesn’t imply fear.
A similar pattern can be found in the 4th exam-
ple of Anger and 3rd example of Joy. The sys-
tem has difficulties in understanding of sarcastic
tweets, for instance, in the 3rd tweet of Anger the
user expressed anger but used lol which is used in
a positive sense most of the times and hence the
system did a bad job at predicting intensity. The
system also fails in predicting sentences having
deeper emotion and sentiment which humans can
understand with a little context. For example, in
sample 4 of sadness, the tweet refers to post travel
blues which humans can understand. But with lit-
tle context, it is difficult for the system to accu-
rately estimate the intensity. The performance is

indicators to provide a reasonable estimate.

4 Future Work & Conclusion

The paper studies the effectiveness of various af-
fect lexicons word embeddings to estimate emo-
tional intensity in tweets. A light-weight easy to
use affect computing framework (EmoInt) to fa-
cilitate ease of experimenting with various lexicon
features for text tasks is open-sourced. It provides
plug and play access to various feature extractors
and handy scripts for creating ensembles.

Few problems explained in the analysis section
can be resolved with the help of sentence embed-
dings which take the context information into con-
sideration. The features used in the system are
generic enough to use them in other affective com-
puting tasks on social media text, not just tweet
data. Another interesting feature of lexicon-based
systems is their good run-time performance during
prediction, future work to benchmark the perfor-
mance of the system can prove vital for deploying
in a real-world setting.
