Abstract 

Mapping phrases between languages as 
translation of each other by using an intermediate 
language (pivot language) may generate 
translation pairs that are wrong. Since a word or a 
phrase has different meanings in different 
contexts, we should map source and target 
phrases in an intelligent way. We propose a 
pruning method based on the context vectors to 
remove those phrase pairs that connect to each 
other by a polysemous pivot phrase or by weak 
translations. We use context vectors to implicitly 
disambiguate the phrase senses and to recognize 
irrelevant phrase translation pairs. 
Using the proposed method a relative 
improvement of 2.8 percent in terms of BLEU 
score is achieved. 

 

1 Introduction 
Parallel corpora as an important component of a 
statistical machine translation system are 
unfortunately unavailable for all pairs of 
languages, particularly in low resource languages 
and also producing it consumes time and cost. 
So, new ideas have been developed about how to 
make a MT system which has lower dependency 
on parallel data like using comparable corpora 
for improving performance of a MT system with 
small parallel corpora or making a MT system 
without parallel corpora. Comparable corpora 
have segments with the same translations. These 
segments might be in the form of words, phrases 
or sentences. So, this extracted information can 
be added to the parallel corpus or might be used 
for adaption of the language model or translation 
model. 
Comparable corpora are easily available 
resources. All texts that are about the same topic 
can be considered as comparable corpora. 
Another idea for solving the scarce resource 

problem is to use a high resource language as a 
pivot to bridge between source and target 
languages. In this paper we use the bridge 
technique to make a source-target system and we 
will prune the phrase table of this system. In 
Section 2, the related works of the bridge 
approach are considered, in Section 3 the 
proposed approach will be explained and it will 
be shown how to prune the phrase table using 
context vectors, and experiments on German-
English-Farsi systems will be presented in 
Section 4. 

2 Related Works 
There are different strategies of bridge 
techniques to make a MT system. The simplest 
way is to build two MT systems in two sides: one 
system is source-pivot and the other is pivot-
target system, then in the translation stage the 
output of the first system is given to the second 
system as an input and the output of the second 
system is the final result. The disadvantage of 
this method is its time consuming translation 
process, since until the first system’s output is 
not ready; the second system cannot start the 
translation process. This method is called 
cascading of two translation systems. 

In the other approach the target side of the 
training corpus of the source-pivot system is 
given to the pivot-target system as its input. The 
output of the pivot-target system is parallel with 
the source side of the training corpus of the 
source-pivot system. A source-to-target system 
can be built by using this noisy parallel corpus 
which in it each source sentence is directly 
translated to a target sentence. This method is 
called the pseudo corpus approach. 
  Another way is combining the phrase tables of 
the source-pivot and pivot-target systems to 
directly make a source-target phrase table. This 
combination is done if the pivot phrase is 

318



identical in both phrase tables. Since one phrase 
has many translations in the other language, a 
large phrase table will be produced. This method 
is called combination of phrase tables approach. 

Since in the bridge language approach two 
translation systems are used to make a final 
translation system, the errors of these two 
translation systems will affect the final output. 
Therefore in order to decrease the propagation of 
these errors, a language should be chosen as 
pivot which its structure is similar to the source 
and target languages. But even by choosing a 
good language as pivot there are some other 
errors that should be handled or decreased such 
as the errors of ploysemous words and etc. 

For making a MT system using pivot language 
several ideas have been proposed. Wu and Wang 
(2009) suggested a cascading method which is 
explained in Section 1. 

Bertoldi (2008) proposed his method in 
bridging at translation time and bridging at 
training time by using the cascading method and 
the combination of phrase tables. 

Bakhshaei (2010) used the combination of 
phrase tables of source-pivot and pivot-target 
systems and produced a phrase table for the 
source-target system. 

Paul (2009) did several experiments to show 
the effect of pivot language in the final 
translation system. He showed that in some cases 
if training data is small the pivot should be more 
similar to the source language, and if training 
data is large the pivot should be more similar to 
the target language. In Addition, it is more 
suitable to use a pivot language that its structure 
is similar to both of source and target languages. 

Saralegi (2011) showed that there is not 
transitive property between three languages. So 
many of the translations produced in the final 
phrase table might be wrong. Therefore for 
pruning wrong and weak phrases in the phrase 
table two methods have been used. One method 
is based on the structure of source dictionaries 
and the other is based on distributional similarity.  

Rapp (1995) suggested his idea about the 
usage of context vectors in order to find the 
words that are the translation of each other in 
comparable corpora. 

In this paper the combination of phrase tables 
approach is used to make a source-target system. 
We have created a base source-target system just 
similar to previous works. But the contribution of 
our work compared to other works is that here 
we decrease the size of the produced phrase table 
and improve the performance of the system. Our 

pruning method is different from the method that 
Saralegi (2011) has used. He has pruned the 
phrase table by computing distributional 
similarity from comparable corpora or by the 
structure of source dictionaries. Here we use 
context vectors to determine the concept of 
phrases and we use the pivot language to 
compare source and target vectors. 

3 Approach 
For the purpose of showing how to create a 
pruned phrase table, in Section 3.1 we will 
explain how to create a simple source-to-target 
system. In Section 3.2 we will explain how to 
remove wrong and weak translations in the 
pruning step. Figure 1 shows the pseudo code of 
the proposed algorithm. 

In the following we have used these 
abbreviations: f, e stands for source and target 
phrases. pl, src-pl, pl-trg, src-trg respectively 
stand for pivot phrase, source-pivot phrase table, 
pivot-target phrase table and source-target 
phrase table.  

3.1 Creating source-to-target system 
At first, we assume that there is transitive 
property between three languages in order to 
make a base system, and then we will show in 
different ways that there is not transitive property 
between three languages.

            p(e|f) =p(pl|f)*p(e|pl) and add (e,f) to src-

For each e in Es calculate similarity of its context 
vector with f context vector 
     Select k top similar as translations of f 
      delete other translations of f in src-trg 

319



For each phrase f in src-pl phrase table, all the 
phrases pl which are translations of f, are 
considered. Then for each of these pls every 
phrase e from the pl-trg phrase table that are 
translations of pl, are found. Finally f is mapped 
to all of these es in the new src-trg phrase table. 

The probability of these new phrases is 
calculated using equation (1) through the 
algorithm that is shown in figure 1. 

( | ) ( | ) ( | )p e f p pl f p e pl= ×            (1)  
A simple src-trg phrase table is created by 

this approach. Pl phrases might be ploysemous 
and produce target phrases that have different 
meaning in comparison to each other. The 
concept of some of these target phrases are 
similar to the corresponding source phrase and 
the concept of others are irrelevant to the source 
phrase.  

The language model can ignore some of these 
wrong translations. But it cannot ignore these 
translations if they have high probability. 

Since the probability of translations is 
calculated using equation (1), therefore wrong 
translations have high probability in three cases: 
first when p(pl|f) is high, second when p(e|pl) is 
high and third when p(pl|f) and p(e|pl) are high. 

In the first case pl might be a good translation 
for f and refers to concept c, but pl and e refer to 
concept 𝑐′ so mapping f to e as a translation of 
each other is wrong. The second case is similar 
to the first case but e might be a good translation 
for pl. The third case is also similar to the first 
case, but pl is a good translation for both f and e. 

The pruning method that is explained in 
Section 3.2, tries to find these translations and 
delete them from the src-trg phrase table. 

3.2 Pruning method 
To determine the concept of each phrase (p) in 
language L at first a vector (V) with length N is 
created. Each element of V is set to zero and N is 
the number of unique phrases in language L. 

In the next step all sentences of the corpus in 
language L are analyzed. For each phrase p if p 
occurs with 𝑝′ in the same sentence the element 
of context vector 𝑉 that corresponds to 𝑝′ is 
pulsed by 1. This way of calculating context 
vectors is similar to Rapp (1999), but here the 
window length of phrase co-occurrence is 
considered a sentence. Two phrases are 
considered as co-occurrence if they occur in the 
same sentence. The distance between them does 
not matter. In other words phrase 𝑝 might be at 
the beginning of the sentence while 𝑝′ being at 

the end of the sentence, but they are considered 
as co-occurrence phrases. 
    For each source (target) phrase its context 
vector should be calculated within the source 
(target) corpus as shown in figure 1. 

The number of unique phrases in the source 
(target) language is equal to the number of 
unique source (target) phrases in the src-trg 
phrase table that are created in the last Section.  

So, the length of source context vectors is m 
and the length of target context vectors is n. 
These variables (m and n) might not be equal. In 
addition to this, source vectors and target vectors 
are in two different languages, so they are not 
comparable. 

One method to translate source context vectors 
to target context vectors is using an additional 
source-target dictionary. But instead here, source 
and target context vectors are translated to pivot 
context vectors. In other words if source context 
vectors have length m and target context vectors 
have length n, they are converted to pivot 
context vectors with length z. The variable z is 
the number of unique pivot phrases in src-pl or 
pl-trg phrase tables.  

To map the source context vector 
𝑆(𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝑚) to the pivot context vector, we 
use a fixed size vector 𝑉1𝑧. Elements of vector 
𝑉1𝑧 = (𝑣1,𝑣2, … , 𝑣𝑧) are the unique phrases 
extracted from src-pl or pl-trg phrase tables. 

𝑉1𝑧 = (𝑣1,𝑣2, … , 𝑣𝑧) = (0, 0, … , 0) 
 In the first step 𝒗𝒊s are set to 0. For each 

element, 𝑠𝑖, of vector S if 𝑠𝑖 > 0 it will be 
translated to k pivot phrases. These phrases are 
the output of k-best translations of 𝑠𝑖 by using 
the src-pl phrase table.

For each element 𝑣′of 𝑉1′𝑘 its corresponding 

element 𝑣 of 𝑉1𝑧 which are equal, will be found, 
then the amount of 𝑣 will be increased by 𝑠𝑖. 

∀ 𝑣′  ∈  𝑉1′𝑘 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑑 (𝑣 ∈  𝑉1𝑧) ∋ 𝑣 = 𝑣′ 
𝑣𝑎𝑙(𝑣) ← 𝑣𝑎𝑙(𝑣) + 𝑠𝑖 

Using K-best translations as middle phrases is 
for reducing the effect of translation errors that 
cause wrong concepts. This work is done for 
each target context vector. Source and target 
context vectors will be mapped to identical 
length vectors and are also in the same language 
(pivot language).Now source and target context 
vectors are comparable, so with a simple 
similarity metric their similarity can be 
calculated. 

Here we use cosine similarity. The similarity 
between each source context vector and each 

320



target context vector that are translations of the 
source phrase in src-trg, are calculated. For 
each source phrase, the N-most similar target 
phrases are kept as translations of the source 
phrase. These translations are also similar in 
context. Therefore this pruning method deletes 
irrelevant translations form the src-trg phrase 
table. The size of the phrase table is decreased 
very much and the system performance is 
increased. Reduction of the phrase table size is 
considerable while its performance is increased. 

4 Experiments 
In this work, we try to make a German-Farsi 

system without using parallel corpora. We use 
English language as a bridge between German 
and Farsi languages because English language is 
a high resource language and parallel corpora of 
German-English and English-Farsi are available. 

We use Moses0F1 (Koehn et al., 2007) as the MT 
decoder and IRSTLM1F2 tools for making the 
language model. Table 1 shows the statistics of 
the corpora that we have used in our 
experiments. The German-English corpus is from 
Verbmobil project (Ney et al., 2000). We 
manually translate 22K English sentences to 
Farsi to build a small Farsi-English-German 
corpus. Therefore, we have a small English-
German corpus as well. 

With the German-English parallel corpus and 
an additional German-English dictionary with 
118480 entries we have made a German-English 
(De-En) system and with English-Farsi parallel 
corpus we have made a German-Farsi (En-Fa) 
system. The BLEU score of these systems are 
shown in Table 1. 

Now, we create a translation system by 
combining phrase tables of De-En and En-Fa 
systems. Details of creating the source-target 
system are explained in Section 3.1. The size of 
this phrase table is very large because of 
ploysemous and some weak translations.

English-Farsi 22,000  31.6 

Table 1. Information of two parallel systems that 
are used in our experiments. 
 

The size of the phrase table is about 55.7 MB. 
Then, we apply the pruning method that we

explained in Section 3.2. With this method only 
the phrases are kept that their context vectors are 
similar to each other. For each source phrase the 
35-most similar target translations are kept. The 
number of phrases in the phrase table is 
decreased dramatically while the performance of 
the system is increased by 2.8 percent BLEU. 
The results of these experiments are shown in 
Table 2. The last row in this table is the result of 
using small parallel corpus to build German-
Farsi system. We observe that the pruning 
method has gain better results compared to the 
system trained on the parallel corpus. This is 
maybe because of some translations that are 
made in the parallel system and do not have 
enough training data and their probabilities are 
not precise. But when we use context vectors to 
measure the contextual similarity of phrases and 
their translations, the impact of these training 
samples are decreased. In Table 3, two wrong 
phrase pairs that pruning method has removed 
them are shown.

In Table 4, we extend the experiments with 
two other methods to build German- 
Farsi system using English as bridging language. 
We see that the proposed method obtains 
competitive result with the pseudo parallel 
method.

Now, we run a series of significance tests to 
measure the superiority of each method. In the 
first significance test, we set the pruned system 
as our base system and we compare the result of 
the pseudo parallel corpus system with it, the 
significance level is 72%. For another 
significance test we set the combined phrase 
table system without pruning as our base system 
and we compare the result of the pruned system 
with it, the significance level is 100%. In the last 
significance test we set the combined phrase 
table system without pruning as our base system 
and we compare the result of the pseudo system 
with it, the significance level is 99%. Therefore, 
we can conclude the proposed method obtains 
the best results and its difference with pseudo 
parallel corpus method is not significant. 

5 Conclusion and future work 
With increasing the size of the phrase table, the 
MT system performance will not necessarily 
increase. Maybe there are wrong translations 
with high probability which the language model 
cannot remove them from the best translations. 
By removing these translation pairs, the 
produced phrase table will be more consistent, 
and irrelevant words or phrases are much less. In 
addition, the performance of the system will be 
increased by about 2.8% BLEU. 
In the future work, we investigate how to use the 
word alignments of the source-to-pivot and 
pivot-to-target systems to better recognize good 
translation pairs.
