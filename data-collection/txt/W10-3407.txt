Abstract 

This paper presents a cross-linguistic 

analysis of the largest dictionaries cur-

rently existing for Romanian, French, and 

German, and a new, robust and portable 

method for Dictionary Entry Parsing 

(DEP), based on Segmentation-

Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) configura-

tions. The SCD configurations are ap-

plied successively on each dictionary en-

try to identify its lexicographic segments 

(the first SCD configuration), to extract 

its sense tree (the second configuration), 

and to parse its atomic sense definitions 

(the third one). Using previous results on 

DLR (The Romanian Thesaurus – new 

format), the present paper adapts and ap-

plies the SCD-based technology to other 

four large and complex thesauri: DAR 

(The Romanian Thesaurus – old format), 

TLF (Le Trésor de la Langue Française), 

DWB (Deutsches Wörterbuch – 

GRIMM), and GWB (Göthe-

Wörterbuch). This experiment is illu-

strated on significantly large parsed en-

tries of these thesauri, and proved the fol-

lowing features: (1) the SCD-based me-
thod is a completely formal grammar-

free approach for dictionary parsing, with 

efficient (weeks-time adaptable) model-

ing through sense hierarchies and parsing 

portability for a new dictionary. (2) SCD-

configurations separate and run sequen-

tially and independently the processes of 

lexicographic segment recognition, sense 

tree extraction, and atomic definition  

 

parsing. (3) The whole DEP process with 

SCD-configurations is optimal. (4) SCD-

configurations, through sense marker 

classes and their dependency hyper-

graphs, offer an unique instrument of lex-

icon construction comparison, sense con-

cept design and DEP standardization. 

1 Introduction 

The general idea behind parsing a large dictio-

nary can be reduced to transforming a raw text 

entry into an indexable linguistic resource. Thus, 

for each dictionary entry, a structured representa-

tion of its senses has to be created, together with 

a detailed description of the entry’s form: i.e. 

morphology, syntax, orthography, phonetics, lex-

ical semantics, etymology, usage, variants etc.  

The aim of this paper is to present an efficient 

dictionary entry parsing (DEP) method, based on 

Segmentation-Cohesion-Dependency (SCD) con-

figurations (Curteanu, 2006), applied on a set of 

five large and complex dictionaries: DLR (The 

Romanian Thesaurus – new format), DAR (The 

Romanian Thesaurus – old format), TLF (Le 

Trésor de la Langue Française), DWB 

(Deutsches Wörterbuch – GRIMM), and GWB 

(Göthe-Wörterbuch).  

The paper is structured in 8 sections: Section 2 

presents the state of the art in DEP, with an em-

phasis on the comparison between the proposed 

method and other dictionary parsing strategies, 

before detailing the SCD-based proposed method 

in Section 3. The following sections present the 

application of the proposed method to the five 

dictionaries. The paper ends with a discussion on 

38



comparative results and development directions 

concerning optimality, portability, standardiza-

tion, and dictionary networks. 

2 Dictionary Entry Parsing 

Natural language text parsing is a complex 

process whose prerequisite essential stage is a 

thorough modeling of the linguistic process to be 

developed, i.e. the structures and relations aimed 

to constitute the final result of the analysis. Simi-

larly, for DEP, the semantics of the lexical struc-

tures, the sense markers, and the hierarchies (de-

pendencies) between sense structures must be 

specified.  

Standard approaches to dictionary entry pars-

ing (referred to from now on as standard DEP), 

such as the one used by (Neff and Boguraev, 

1989), the LexParse system presented in (Hauser 

and Storrer, 1993; Kammerer, 2000; Lemnitzer 

and Kunze, 2005), or lexicographic grammars, as 

those presented in (Curteanu & Amihaesei, 2004; 

Tufis et al., 1999), recognize the sense / subsense 

definitions in a strictly sequential manner, along 

with the incremental building of the entry sense 

tree. The interleaving of the two running 

processes is the main source of errors and ineffi-

ciency for the whole DEP process. 

Both the standard DEP (Figure 1) and our 

proposed method based on SCD-configurations 

(Figure 2) involve the following three running 

cycles and four essential phases for extracting the 

sense-tree structure from a dictionary:  

[A1], [B1] – parsing the lexicographic seg-

ments of an entry; 

[A2], [B2] – parsing the sense-description 

segment of the dictionary entry, at the level of 

explicitly defined senses, until and not including 

the contents of the atomic definitions / senses; at 

this stage, the sense-tree of the sense-description 

segment is built having (sets of) atomic senses / 

definitions in their leaf-nodes.  

[A3], [B3] – parsing the atomic definitions / 

senses. 
Phase_1 := Sense-i Marker Recognition;  

Phase_2 := Sense-i Definition Parsing;  

Phase_3 := Attach Parsed Sense-i Definition 

  to Node-i; 

Phase_4 := Add Node-i to EntrySense-Tree. 
The parsing cycles and phases of existing ap-

proaches, called standard DEP, are summarized 

by the pseudo-code in Fig. 1, where Marker-

Number is the number of markers in the dictio-

nary-entry marker sequence and EntrySegment-

Number is the number of lexicographic segments 

of the parsed entry. 
[A1].  For s from 1 to EntrySegmentNumber  

  If(Segment-s = Sense-Segment) 

[A2].   For i from 0 to MarkerNumber  

  Phase_1  Sense-i Marker Recognition;  

  Phase_2  Sense-i Definition Parsing;  
[A3].    If(Success) 

   Phase_3  Attach Parsed Sense-i   

     Defi nition to Node-i; 

   Phase_4  Add Node-i to Entry 

     Sense Tree;  

[/A3].   Else Fail and Stop. 

[/A2].  EndFor 

   Output: EntrySenseTree with  

   Parsed Sense Definitions  
   (only if all sense definitions are parsed). 

  Else Segment-s Parsing; 

  Continue 

[/A1]. EndFor 

 Output: Entry parsed segments, including the  
 Sense-Segment (only if all definitions in the  

 Sense-Segment are parsed). 

Fig. 1. Standard dictionary entry parsing 

The main drawback of the classical, standard 

DEP, is the embedding of the parsing cycles, 

[A1] [A2] [A3] ... [/A3] [/A2] [/A1], derived 

from the intuitive, but highly inefficient parsing 

strategy based on the general Depth-First search-

ing. After presenting the SCD-based dictionary 

parsing method, section 3.2. compares the pars-

ing cycles and phases of standard DEP to the 

ones of SCD-based DEP.  

3 Parsing with SCD Configurations  

The SCD configuration(s) method is a 

procedural, recognition-generation computa-

tional device, that is distinct from the traditional 

and cumbersome formal grammars, being able to 

successfully replace them for several tasks of 

natural language parsing, including text free 

parsing (Curteanu, 2006) and thesauri parsing 

(Curteanu et al., 2008). For SCD-based parsing, 

the semantics and the linguistic modeling of the 

text to be analyzed should be clearly specified at 

each parsing level, and implemented within the 

following components of each SCD 

configuration (hereafter, SCD-config):  

 A set of marker classes: a marker is a 
boundary for a specific linguistic category 

(e.g. A., I., 1., a)., etc.). Markers are 

joined into marker classes, with respect to 

39



their functional similarity (e.g. {A., B., C., 

…}, {1., 2., 3., …}, {a)., b)., …});  

 A hypergraph-like hierarchy that estab-
lishes the dependencies among the marker 

classes;  

 A searching (parsing) algorithm. 
Once an SCD configuration is defined, parsing 

with the SCD configuration implies identifying 

the markers in the text to be parsed, constructing 

the sequences of markers and categories, recog-

nizing the marked text structures (spans within 

the bounding markers) corresponding to the SCD 

configuration semantics, and classifying them 

according to the marker sequences within the 

pre-established hierarchy assigned to that SCD 

configuration. The last step settles the dependen-

cies and correlations among the parsed textual 

structures. Identifying the lexicographic seg-

ments of an entry, the syntactic and semantic 

structure of each segment, the senses, definitions 

and their corresponding markers, is the result of 

an in-depth lexical semantics analysis. Designing 

the classes and the hypergraph structure of their 

dependencies are essential cognitive aspects of 

working with SCD configurations, and need to 

be pre-established for each dictionary.  

Within the parsing process, each SCD confi-

guration, i.e. marker classes, hierarchy, and 

searching algorithm, is completely commanded 

by its attached semantics. The semantically-

driven parsing process, either for free or specia-

lized texts, consists in a number of SCD configu-

rations applied sequentially (in cascade), each 

one on a different semantic level. The semantic 

levels (each one driving an SCD configuration) 

are subsuming each other in a top-down, mono-

tonic manner, starting with the most general se-

mantics of the largest text span, until the most 

specific level.  

3.1 SCD Configurations for DEP  

The SCD-based process for DEP consists in three 

SCD configurations, applied sequentially on the 

levels and sublevels of the dictionary entry, 

where each level should be monotonic at the lex-

ical-semantics subsumption relation.  

The task of applying the SCD configurations 

to DEP requires knowing the semantics of the 

corresponding classes of sense and definition 

markers, together with their hierarchical repre-

sentation. 

The first SCD configuration (SCD-config1) is 

devoted to the task of obtaining the partition of 

the entry lexicographic segments (Hauser & 

Storrer, 1993). Since usually there are no depen-

dency relations between lexicographic segments, 

SCD-config1 is not planned to establish the de-

pendency relations (cycle [A1] in Fig. 1, or cycle 

[B1] in Fig. 2).  

The second important task of DEP is to parse 

each lexicographic segment according to its spe-

cific semantics and linguistic structure. The most 

prominent lexicographic segment of each entry is 

the sense-description one, the central operation 

being the process of extracting the sense tree 

from the segment. This is the purpose of the 

second SCD configuration (denoted 

SCD-config2), corresponding exactly to the 

DSSD parsing algorithm in (Curteanu et al., 

2008), which, for the DLR sense trees, has a pre-

cision of 91.18%. In order to refine the lexical-

semantics of primary senses, one has to descend, 

under secondary senses, into the definitions and 

definition examples, which constitute the text 

spans situated between two sequentially-related 

nodes of the parsed sense tree. This SCD confi-

guration is represented as cycle [B2] in Fig. 2. 

The third step of DEP parsing (cycle [B3] in 

Fig. 2) is represented by the configuration 

SCD-config3, needed to complete the DEP. 

SCD-config3 consists in a specific set of marker 

classes for the segmentation at dictionary defini-

tions, the hypergraph-like hierarchy of the 

classes of markers for these sense definitions, 

and the parsing algorithm to establish the depen-

dencies among atomic senses / definitions. As a 

prerequisite groundwork, an adequate modeling 

of the sense definitions is needed and the seg-

mentation of definitions is implemented as an 

essential step to establish the dependency-by-

subsumption among the sense types of the consi-

dered thesaurus. The final result of the entry 

parsing process should be the sequential applica-

tion of the SCD-config1, SCD-config2, and 

SCD-config3 configurations.  

3.2 A Structural Analysis: Standard DEP vs. 
SCD Configurations  

A pilot experiment of parsing with SCD configu-

rations was its application to the DLR thesaurus 

parsing (Curteanu et al., 2008); the process of 

sense tree building has been completely detached 

40



and extracted from the process of sense definition 

parsing. 

The sense-tree parsing with SCD-based DEP 

cycles and phases is summarized in pseudo-code 

in Fig. 2 and comparative Table 1 below.

  Else Continue

 Output: Entry parsed segments, not including the  

 Sense-Segment;

   Node-i;  
  Phase_4  Add Node-i to EntrySenseTree;  

   Standby on Sense-i Definition Parsing;  

[/B2]. EndFor 

 Output: EntrySenseTree (with unparsed sense  

 definitions).  

  Node-k = Root(EntrySenseTree); 

[B3]. While not all nodes in EntrySenseTree are  

   visited  

  Phase_2  Sense-k Definition Parsing;  

   If(Success) 

  Phase_3  Attach Parsed Sense-k Definition to  

   Node-k;  
  Else Attach Sense-k Parsing Result to Node-k;  

   Node-k = getNextDepth 

   FirstNode(EntrySenseTree) 

  Continue 

[/B3]. EndWhile. 

 Output: EntrySenseTree (with parsed or unparsed  

definitions). 

 Output: Entry parsed segments, including the  

 Sense-Segment.

Table 1: Dictionary parsing phases in  

standard DEP and SCD-based DEP  
 

Table 1 presents the ordering of the dictionary 

parsing phases in the standard DEP strategy (the 

four phases are embedded) and the SCD-based 

DEP strategy (the phases are organized in a li-

nearly sequential order). 

Since the process of sense tree construction 

(cycle Phase_1 + Phase_4) has been made com-

pletely detachable from the parsing of the (atom-

ic) sense definitions (cycle Phase_2 + Phase_3), 

the whole SCD-based DEP process is much more 

efficient and robust. An efficiency feature of the 

SCD-based parsing technique is that, working 

exclusively on sense marker sequences, outputs 

of [B2] and [B3] cycles in Fig. 2 (i.e. sense trees) 

are obtained either the sense definition parsing 

process succeeds or not, either correct or not! 

These properties of the new parsing method 

with SCD configurations have been effectively 

supported by the parsing experiments on large 

Romanian, French, and German dictionaries. 

4 Romanian DLR Parsing  

The study of the application of SCD-

configuration to DEP started with the analysis of 

the DLR parsing (Curteanu et al., 2008). Fig. 3 

presents the hierarchy of SCD-config2 for DLR 

sense marker classes,

devoted to sense tree parsing. The dashed ar-

rows point to the upper or lower levels of DLR 

sense marker hierarchy, from the literal enume-

ration layer-embedded level. The continuous-

dashed arrows in Fig. 3 point downwards from 

the higher to the lower priority levels of DLR 

marker class hypergraph. Because of its special 

representation characteristics, the literal enume-

ration is illustrated on a layer attached to the hie-

rarchy level (dashed line) to which it belongs, on 

each of the sense levels.  

A detailed description of the DLR sense tree 

extraction with SCD-config2 (denoted as DSSD 

algorithm) is found in (Curteanu et al., 2008). 

4.1 DLR Parsing: Problems and Results  

The three SCD-configurations establish the de-

pendencies among DLR senses (SCD-config1-2) 

and definitions (SCD-config3). However, DLR is 

encoded by default inheritance rules of senses 

(definitions), acting on all the node levels of the 

sense / definition trees. 

The sense tree parser (output of SCD-config2) 

was tested on more than 500 dictionary entries of 

large and medium sizes. The success rate was 

91.18%, being computed as a perfect match be-

tween the output of the program and the gold 

standard. Furthermore, it is worth noting that an 

entry with only one incorrect parse (i.e. one node 

in the sense tree attached incorrectly) was consi-

dered to be erroneously parsed in its entirety, an 

approach which disregards all the other correctly 

attached nodes in that entry.  

A first source of parsing errors is the non-

monotony of the marker values: “A. [B. missing] 

… C. …“; “2. [instead of 1.]... 2. …”; “…a)… b) 

… c) … b) [instead of d)] …”. Another major 

source of parsing errors comes from the inherent 

ambiguity in deciding which is the regent and 

which is the dependent (sub)sense in marker se-

quences as “1. a) b) c) ◊ [◊]…”.  

For evaluating SCD-config3, 52 dictionary en-

tries of various sizes were used as a gold stan-

dard, totaling a number of approximately 2000 

chunks and 22,000 words. The results are given 

in Table 2. Upon further analysis of the evalua-

tion results, the most frequent errors were found 

to be due to faulty sigle (abbreviation of the 

source of examples) segmentation. A detailed 

analysis of the error types for the DLR dictionary 

is discussed in (Curteanu et al., 2009).

Correcting the acquisition of sigles leads to a 

94.43% f-measure for exact match (the number 

of correctly identified sense and definition units) 

and a 98.01% f-measure for overlap (the number 

of correctly classified words in each entry). To 

achieve the DLR parsing process completely, the 

last operation to be executed is to establish the 

dependency relations between atomic senses / 

definitions, under all the sense nodes in the com-

puted sense-tree of the entry. Currently, the DLR 

is parsed almost completely, including at atomic 

senses / definitions, the lexicographic segments 

and sense-trees being obtained with a correctness 

rate above 90% for explicitly marked sense defi-

nitions. 

5 Romanian DAR Parsing  

The structure of the main lexicographical seg-

ments in DAR is outlined below: 

I. The French Translation segment, denoted 

FreSeg, contains the French translations of the 

lemma and the main sense hierarchy of the entry 

word. The translation of the sense structure into 

Romanian and the complete description of the 

sense tree in DAR are in a subsumption relation. 

In some cases, the French translation may not 

exist for specific Romanian lemmas.  

II. The general description segment (RomSeg) 

is composed of several paragraphs and contains 

morphologic, syntactic, semantic, or usage in-

formation on the entry word. RomSeg usually 

starts with the entry word in italics (otherwise, 

the entry word occurs in the first row of the first 

paragraph). 

III. The third segment of a DAR entry, called 

SenseSeg, is the lexical-semantic description of 

the entry word. SenseSeg is the main objective of 

the lexicographic analysis of the entry parsing in 

order to obtain its sense tree. 

IV. The fourth segment of a DAR, NestSeg, 

contains one or more “nests”, which are seg-

ments of text describing morphological, syntac-

tic, phonological, regional, etc. variants of an 

entry, sometimes with an attached description of 

the specific senses. The structure of the DAR 

nest segment is similar to that of a typical DAR 

entry, and the recursive nature of DAR entries 

comes from the sense parsing of nest segments. 

42



V. The fifth segment of DAR entries, denoted 

EtymSeg, contains etymological descriptions of 

the entry word and is introduced by an etymolo-

gy-dash (long dash “–”). Among the five seg-

ments of a DAR entry, the only compulsory ones 

are FreSeg and SenseSeg. The other three seg-

ments are optional in the entry description, de-

pending on each entry word. 

5.1 DAR Marker Classes and Hierarchy 

The priority ordering of DAR marker classes is:  

1.  Capital letters (LatCapLett_Enum): A., B., ... 

2.  Capital roman numerals (LatCap-

Numb_Enum): I., II., ... 

3.  Arabic numerals (ArabNumb_Enum): 1
0
., 2

0
. 

These markers introduce the primary senses, in a 

similar manner to those in DLR. 

4. For introducing secondary senses, DAR uses 

the same sense markers used in DLR for defini-

tions of type MorfDef, RegDef, BoldDef, ItalDef, 

SpecDef, SpSpecDef, and DefExem, and a set of 

markers specific to DAR: ||, |, #, †.  

5. According to the level of the lexical-semantic 

description, DAR uses literal enumeration on 

two levels: (5.a) lowercase Latin letters (LatS-

mallLett_Enum): a.), b.), … (5.b) a LatSmal 

lLett_Enum can have another enumeration, using 

lowercase Greek letters (GreSmallLett_Enum): 

α.), β.), γ.), … 

The hierarchies for sense markers in DAR are 

given in Fig. 4. 

 

5.2 Special problems in DAR parsing 

A first difficulty for parsing the DAR lexico-

graphic segments is the occurrence of the 

New_Paragraph (NewPrg). For NewPrg marker  

 

Fig. 4: Dependency hypergraph for DAR 

 

recognition we used an implicit level of enumera-

tion, LatSmaNum_Enum discriminating the cases 

when NewPrg is (or not) accompanied by anoth-

er type of DAR sense marker.  

The second difficult problem in DAR parsing 

is the process of refining the NewPrg marker 

with literal enumerations (LatSmallLett_Enum), 

which can be in turn refined by an implicit enu-

meration using NewPrg. This has been solved by 

interpreting the sense levels for enumerations 

according to their context.  

Using SCD configurations, we have parsed 37 

DAR entries of large and medium sizes. The re-

sults of the DAR parsing have been evaluated 

manually, and we estimated the parsing precision 

as really promising, taking into account the diffi-

cult problems raised by DAR. The lack of a gold 

standard for DAR entries did not allow perform-

ing an automatic evaluation at this moment.

6 French TLF Parsing  

The French TLF, a very well-organized and 

structured thesaurus, provides both similarities 

and distinctive characteristics in comparison to 

the Romanian DLR. The structure of TLF lex-

icographic segments, obtained with the 

SCD-config1, is relatively simple. A TLF entry 

commences with the sense-description segment, 

optionally (but very frequently) followed by a 

package of “final” segments, introduced by spe-

cific labels, as in the pattern:

As one may notice, some final segments can 

enclose particular sense descriptions, similarly to 

those met in the proper sense-description seg-

ment. The sense markers in TLF resemble to 

those in DLR, but there are also significant dif-

ferences. The dependency hypergraph of the 

TLF marker classes is the following:

Cross-linguistic hints involving TLF entry 

parsing with SCD configurations: (a) A new 

sense marker (compared to DLR) is “–“ (inherit-

ance- dash), aiming to signal the presence of an 

inherited sense. (b) When “–“ occurs after anoth-

er TLF marker, the “–“ role is to inherit a parent 

sense (either regent or not) from the sense-tree. 

(c) When “–“ begins at new paragraph (NewPrg), 

its role is of a intermediary subsense, inheriting 

the meaning of the regent (sub)sense. 

(d) Another new TLF marker is “1., 2., ” 

(indexed, small red-ball), defining the new TLF 

sense concept: Indexed Examples to Definitions 

for the whole entry (denoted IdxDefExem). 

(e) The literal enumeration with Latin small let-

ters (LatSmaLett_Enum) is refined with Greek 

small letters (GreSmaLett_Enum). (f) In TLF, 

only the filled diamond “♦” marker is present (as 

secondary sense); the empty diamond “◊” is 

missing. (g) Some primary senses (“I.”, “A.”) in 

44



TLF receive reversed priorities (Fig. 5) in the 

marker class hierarchy as compared to DLR.  

6.1 TLF Parsing Results  

For TLF, we processed 31 significant entries 

(TLFi, 2010) of medium and large dimensions 

(entries of 5 pages each, A4 format, in average) 

with the parser based on SCD configurations. 

The parsing results have been evaluated manual-

ly, the correctness rate being above 90%. One of 

the reasons of these very promising results for 

TLF parsing may be the regularity and standar-

dization of the TLF entry texts. An automatic, 

precise evaluation of the SCD-based parser was 

not possible since we are missing currently a 

gold-corpus of TLF entries.

7 Lexicographic Segments and Sense 
Markers in German DWB and GWB  

The German DWB entries comprise a complex 

structure of the lexicographic segments, which 

provide a non-uniform and non-unitary composi-

tion (Das Woerterbuch-Netz, 2010). One special 

feature is that DWB and GWB lexicographic 

segments are composed of two parts: a first (op-

tional) root-sense subsegment, and the segment 

body, which contain the explicit sense markers, 

easily recognizable. For DWB, the parsing of 

lexicographic segments is not at all a comfortable 

task since they are defined by three distinct 

means:  

(A) After the root-sense of a DWB entry, or 

after the root-sense of a lexicographic segment, 

(a list of) italicized-and-spaced key-words are 

placed to constitute the label of the lexicographic 

segment that follows. Samples of such key-word 

labels for DWB lexicographic segments are: 

“Form, Ausbildung und Ursprung”, “Formen”, 

“Ableitungen”, 

“Verwandtschaft”,“Verwandtschaft und Form”, 

“Formelles und Etymologisches”, “Gebrauch”, 

“Herkunft”, “Grammatisches”, etc., or, for DWB 

sense-description segment: “Bedeutung und 

Gebrauch” (or just “Bedeutung”). In the example 

below, they are marked in grey.

dem anord. gebrauch): ... 

(B) The second way to specify the DWB cur-

rent lexicographic segments is to use their labels 

as key-words immediately after the primary 

sense markers. 

(C) The third (and most frequent) way to iden-

tify the lexical description segment(s) of a DWB 

entry is simply the lack of a segment label at the 

beginning of the sense description segment. By 

default, after the entry root-sense segment (which 

can be reduced to the Latin translation of the 

German lemma) the sense-description segment 

comes, without any “Bedeutung” label, introduc-

ing explicit sense markers and definitions.  

7.1 German DWB and GWB Dependency 
Hypergraphs. Parsing Results

dependency hypergraphs in Fig.6 and Fig.7), one

eral resemblance hold between DAR

Fig. 7. GWB dependency hypergraph 

 

A number of 17 very large DWB entries have 

been parsed only with SCD-config1 and SCD-

config2. We appreciate on this small but signifi-

cant excerpt of DWB entries that parsing of the 

sense description segment at sense trees is per-

formed with a high precision, but delimitation of 

the lexicographic (sub-)segments and labels is a 

more difficult problem. The lack of a DWB entry 

gold corpus did not allow a precise, automated 

evaluation of the parser.  

8 Directions: Optimal Lexicon Design, 
Standardization, Lexicon Networks  

The special features of parsing with SCD confi-

gurations (SCD-configs) are:  SCD-configs is a 
completely formal grammar-free approach which 

involves simple, efficient (weeks-time adapta-

ble), thus portable modeling and programs.  In 
all currently existing DEP methods, the sense 

tree construction of each entry is, more or less, 

recursively embedded and mixed within the defi-

nition parsing procedures.  SCD-configs pro-
vides a lexical-semantics refinement level on 

each SCD-config.  SCD-configs separate and 
run sequentially, on independent levels (viz. con-

figurations), the processes of lexicographic seg-

ment recognition, sense tree extraction, and 

atomic definition parsing.  This makes the 
whole DEP process with SCD-configs to be op-

timal.  The sense marker classes and their de-
pendency hypergraphs, specific to each thesau-

rus, offer an unique instrument of lexicon con-

46



struction comparison, sense concept design and 

standardization. With the SCD parsing technique, 

one can easily compare the sense categories, 

their marking devices, the complexity and recur-

siveness measure of the sense dependency 

hypergraphs for each thesaurus.  

The cross-linguistic analysis of the five large 

thesauri showed the necessity of a careful lexi-

cal-semantics modeling of each dictionary. 

Equally important, many semantic and lexico-

graphic concepts such as sense markers and defi-

nitions, (indexed) examples to definitions, sense 

and source references etc. can be similar, adapta-

ble, and transferable between corresponding 

SCD-configurations of different thesauri.  

The SCD-configs analysis pointed out the 

need of a more general and adequate terminology 

for the lexical-semantics notions. E.g., compar-

ing the Romanian and French thesauri with the 

German ones, we decided that, while preserving 

the definition type labels MorfDef, DefExem, 

SpecDef and SpSpecDef, we should change the 

RegDef into GlossDef, BoldDef into IdiomDef, 

ItalDef into CollocDef, and add the TLF IdxDe-

fExem (an indexed DefExem) to the sense con-

cept set.  

The future experiments will continue with new 

thesauri parsing: Russian, Spanish, Italian, but 

the true challenge shall be oriented towards Chi-

nese / Japanese thesauri, aiming to establish a 

thorough lexical-semantics comparison and a 

language-independent, portable DEP technology 

based on SCD configurations. A further devel-

opment would be to align the Romanian thesauri 

sense and definition types to TEI P5 standards 

(XCES, 2007), and to design an optimal and 

cross-linguistic compatible network of Romanian 

electronic dictionaries, similar to a very good 

project of dictionary network, i.e. the German 

Woerterbuch-Netz (with links to TLFi entries 

too), whose twelve component lexicons include 

DWB and GWB.
