Abstract

Automatic evaluation metrics are fundamen-
tally important for Machine Translation, al-
lowing comparison of systems performance
and efficient training. Current evaluation met-
rics fall into two classes: heuristic approaches,
like BLEU, and those using supervised learn-
ing trained on human judgement data. While
many trained metrics provide a better match
against human judgements, this comes at the
cost of including lots of features, leading to
unwieldy, non-portable and slow metrics. In
this paper, we introduce a new trained met-
ric, ROSE, which only uses simple features
that are easy portable and quick to compute.
In addition, ROSE is sentence-based, as op-
posed to document-based, allowing it to be
used in a wider range of settings. Results show
that ROSE performs well on many tasks, such
as ranking system and syntactic constituents,
with results competitive to BLEU. Moreover,
this still holds when ROSE is trained on hu-
man judgements of translations into a different
language compared with that use in testing.

1 Introduction

Human judgements of translation quality are very
expensive. For this reason automatic MT evalu-
ation metrics are used to as an approximation by
comparing predicted translations to human authored
references. An early MT evaluation metric, BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002), is still the most commonly
used metric in automatic machine translation evalu-
ation. However, several drawbacks have been stated
by many researchers (Chiang et al., 2008a; Callison-
Burch et al., 2006; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), most

notably that it omits recall (substituting this with a
penalty for overly short output) and not being easily
applied at the sentence level. Later heuristic metrics
such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and
TER (Snover et al., 2006) account for both precision
and recall, but their relative weights are difficult to
determine manually.

In contrast to heuristic metrics, trained met-
rics use supervised learning to model directly hu-
man judgements. This allows the combination
of different features and can better fit specific
tasks, such as evaluation focusing more on flu-
ency/adequacy/relative ranks or post editing effort.
Previous work includes approaches using classifica-
tion (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001), regression (Alber-
cht and Hwa, 2008; Specia and Gimenez, 2010), and
ranking (Duh, 2008). Most of which achieved good
results and better correlations with human judg-
ments than heuristic baseline methods.

Overall automatic metrics must find a balance be-
tween several key issues: a) applicability to differ-
ent sized texts (documents vs sentences), b) easy
of portability to different languages, c) runtime re-
quirements and d) correlation with human judge-
ment data. Previous work has typically ignored at
least one of these issues, e.g., BLEU which applies
only to documents (A), trained metrics (Albercht
and Hwa, 2008; Specia and Gimenez, 2010) which
tend to ignore B and C.

This paper presents ROSE, a trained metric which
is loosely based on BLEU, but seeks to further sim-
plify its components such that it can be used for sen-
tence level evaluation. This contrasts with BLEU
which is defined over large documents, and must

123



be coarsely approximated to allow sentence level
application. The increased flexibility of ROSE al-
lows the metric to be used in a wider range of situ-
ations, including during decoding. ROSE is a linear
model with a small number of simple features, and
is trained using regression or ranking against human
judgement data. A benefit of using only simple fea-
tures is that ROSE can be trivially ported between
target languages, and that it can be run very quickly.
Features include precision and recall over different
sized n-grams, and the difference in word counts
between the candidate and the reference sentences,
which is further divided into content word, func-
tion word and punctuation. An extended versions
also includes features over Part of Speech (POS) se-
quences.

The paper is structured as follows: Related work
on metrics for statistical machine translation is de-
scribed in Section 2. Four variations of ROSE and
their features will be introduced in Section 3. In sec-
tion 4 we presents the result, showing how ROSE
correlates well with human judgments on both sys-
tem and sentence levels. Conclusions are given at
the end of the paper.

2 Related Work

The defacto standard metric in machine translation
is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). This measures
n-gram precision (n normally equal to 1,2,3,4) be-
tween a document of candidate sentences and a
set of human authored reference documents. The
idea is that high quality translations share many n-
grams with the references. In order to reduce re-
peatedly generating the same word, BLEU clips the
counts of each candidate N-gram to the maximum
counts of that n-gram that in references, and with
a brevity penalty to down-scale the score for out-
put shorter than the reference. In BLEU, each n-
gram precision is given equal weight in geometric
mean, while NIST (Doddington and George, 2002)
extended BLEU by assigning more informative n-
grams higher weight.

However, BLEU and NIST have several draw-
backs, the first being that BLEU uses a geometric
mean over all n-grams which makes BLEU almost
unusable for sentence level evaluations 1. Secondly,

1Note that various approximations exits (Lin and Och, 2004;

BLEU and NIST both use the brevity penalty to re-
place recall, but Banerjee and Lavie (2005) in exper-
iments show that the brevity penalty is a poor sub-
stitute for recall.

Banerjee and Lavie (2005) proposed a METEOR
metric, which that uses recall instead of the BP.
Callison-Burch et al. (2007; Callison-Burch et al.
(2008) show that METEOR does not perform well in
out of English task. This may because that Stemmer
or WordNet may not available in some languages,
which unable to model synonyms in these cases. In
addition, the performance also varies when adjusting
weights in precision and recall.

Supervised learning approaches have been pro-
posed by many researchers (Corston-Oliver et al.,
2001; Duh, 2008; Albercht and Hwa, 2008; Spe-
cia and Gimenez, 2010). Corston-Oliver et al.
(2001) use a classification method to measure ma-
chine translation system quality at the sentence level
as being human-like translation (good) or machine
translated (bad). Features extracted from references
and machine translation include heavy linguistic fea-
tures (requires parser).

Quirk (2004) proposed a linear regression model
which is trained to match translation quality. Alber-
cht and Hwa (2008) introduced pseudo-references
when data driven regression does not have enough
training data. Most recently, Specia and Gimenez
(2010) combined confidence estimation (without
reference, just using the source) and reference-based
metrics together in a regression framework to mea-
sure sentence-level machine translation quality.

Duh (2008) compared the ranking with the re-
gression, with the results that with same feature set,
ranking and regression have similar performance,
while ranking can tolerate more training data noise.

3 Model

ROSE is a trained automatic MT evaluation metric
that works on sentence level. It is defined as a linear
model, and its weights will be trained by Support
Vector Machine. It is formulated as

S = −→w ·f(−→c ,−→r ) (1)

where −→w is the feature weights vector, f(−→c ,−→r ) is
the feature function which takes candidate transla-

124



tion (−→c ) and reference (−→c ), and returns the feature
vector. S is the response variable, measuring the
‘goodness’ of the candidate translation. A higher
score means a better translation, although the mag-
nitude is not always meaningful.

We present two different method for training:
a linear regression approach ROSE-reg, trained to
match human evaluation score, and a ranking ap-
proach ROSE-rank to match the relative ordering of
pairs of translations assigned by human judge. Un-
like ROSE-reg, ROSE-rank only gives relative score
between sentences, such as A is better than B. The
features that used in ROSE will be listed in section
3.1, and the regression and ranking training are de-
scribed in section 3.2

3.1 ROSE Features

Features used in ROSE listed in Table 1 include
string n-gram matching, Word count and Part of
Speech (POS). String N-gram matching features, are
used for measure how closely of the candidate sen-
tence resembles the reference. Both precision and
recall are considered. Word count features measure
length differences between the candidate and refer-
ence, which is further divided into function words,
punctuation and content words. POS features are
defined over POS n-gram matches between the can-
didate and reference.

3.1.1 String Matching Features
The string matching features include n-gram pre-

cision, n-gram recall and F1-measure. N-gram
precision measures matches between sequence of
words in the candidate sentence compared to the ref-
erences,

Pn =

∑
n-gram∈−→c Count(n-gram)Jn-gram ∈ −→r K∑

n-gram∈−→c Count(ngram)
(2)

where Count are the occurrence counts of n-grams
in the candidate sentence, the numerator measures
the number of predicted n-grams that also occur in
the reference.

Recall is also used in ROSE, so clipping was
deemed unnecessary in precision calculation, where
the repeating words will increasing precision but at
the expense of recall. F-measure is also included,
which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

n=1...4

Table 1: ROSE Features. The first column is the feature
number. The dashed line separates the core features from
the POS extended features.

With there are multiple references, the n-gram preci-
sion error uses the same strategy as BLEU: n-grams
in candidate can match any of the references. For
recall, ROSE will match the n-grams in each refer-
ence separately, and then choose the recall for the
reference with minimum error.

3.1.2 Word Count Features
The word count features measure the length dif-

ference between a candidate sentence and reference
sentence. In a sentence, content words are more in-
formative than function words (grammatical words)
and punctuation. Therefore, the number of content
word candidate is a important indicator in evalua-
tion. In this case, besides measuring the length at
whole sentences, we also measure difference in the
number of function words, punctuation and content
words. We normalise by the length of the refer-
ence which allows comparability between short ver-
sus long sentences. In multiple reference cases we
choose the ratio that is closest to 1.

3.1.3 Part of Speech Features
The string matching features and word count fea-

tures only measure similarities on the lexical level,
but not over sentence structure or synonyms. To add
this capability we also include Part of Speech (POS)
features which work similar to the String Matching
features, but using POS instead of words. The fea-

125



tures measure precision, recall and F-measure over
POS n-grams (n=1...4). In addition, we also include
features that mixed string and POS.

The string/POS mixed feature is used for handling
synonyms. One problem in string n-gram match-
ing is not being able to deal with the synonyms be-
tween the candidate translation and the reference.
One approach for doing so is to use an external re-
source such as WordNet (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005),
however this would limit the portability of the met-
ric. Instead we use POS as a proxy. In most of
the cases, synonyms share the same POS, so this
can be rewarded by forming n-grams over a mix-
ture of tokens and POS. During the matching pro-
cess, both words and its POS shall be considered, if
either matches between reference and candidate, the
n-gram matches will be counted.

Considering the example in table 2, candidate 1
has better translation than candidate 2 and 3. If only
the string N-gram matching is used, that will give the
same score to candidate 1, 2 and 3. The n-gram pre-
cision scores obtained by all candidate sentences in
this example are: 2-gram = 1, 3-gram = 0. However,
we can at least distinguish candidate 1 is better than
candidate 3 if string POS mixed precision is used ,
n-gram precision for candidate 1 will be: 2-gram =
2, 3-gram = 1, which ranks candidate 1 better than
candidate 3.

candidate 1: A/DT red/ADJ car/NN
candidate 2: A/DT red/ADJ rose/NN
candidate 3: A/DT red/ADJ red/ADJ

Table 2: Evaluation Example

3.2 Training

The model was trained on human evaluation data
in two different ways, regression and ranking.These
both used SVM-light (Joachims, 1999). In the rank-
ing model, the training data are candidate translation
and their relative rankings were ranked by human
judge for a given input sentence. The SVM finds
the minimum magnitude weights that are able to cor-
rectly rank training data which is framed as a series

of constraints reflecting all pairwise comparisons. A
soft-margin formulation is used to allow training er-
rors with a penalty (Joachims, 2002). For regres-
sion, the training data is human annotation of post-
edit effort (this will be further described in section
4.1). The Support vector Regression learns weights
with minimum magnitude that limit prediction er-
ror to within an accepted range, again with a soft-
margin formulation (Smola and Schlkopf, 2004).

A linear kernel function will be used, because
non-linear kernels are much slower to use and are
not decomposable. Our experiments showed that the
linear kernel performed at similar accuracy to other
kernel functions (see section 4.2).

4 Experimental Setup

Our experiments test ROSE performance on docu-
ment level with three different Kernel functions: lin-
ear, polynomial and radial basis function. Then we
compare four variants of ROSE with BLEU on both
sentence and system (document) level.

The BLEU version we used here is NIST Open
MT Evaluation tool mteval version 13a, smooth-
ing was disabled and except for the sentence level
evaluation experiment. The system level evalua-
tion procedure follows WMT08 (Callison-Burch et
al., 2008), which ranked each system submitted on
WMT08 in three types of tasks:

• Rank: Human judges candidate sentence rank
in order of quality. On the document level, doc-
uments are ranked according to the proportion
of candidate sentences in a document that are
better than all of the candidates.

• Constituent: The constituent task is the same
as for ranking but operates over chosen syntac-
tic constituents.

• Yes/No: WMT08 Yes/No task is to let human
judge decide whether the particular part of a
sentence is acceptable or not. Document level
Yes/No ranks a document according to their
number of YES sentences

Spearman’s rho correlation was used to measure
the quality of the metrics on system level. Four tar-
get languages (English, German, French and Span-
ish) were used in system level experiments. ROSE-

126



reg and ROSE-rank were tested in all target lan-
guage sets, but ROSE-regpos was only tested in the
into-English set as it requires a POS tagger. On the
sentence level, we compare sentences ranking that
ranked by metrics against human ranking. The eval-
uation quality was examined by Kendall’s tau cor-
relation, and tied results from human judges were
excluded.

4.1 Data

Training data used for ROSE is from WMT10
(Callison-Burch et al., 2010) human judged sen-
tences. A regression model was trained by sentences
with human annotation for post editing effort. The
three levels used in WMT10 are ‘OK’, ‘EDIT’ and
‘BAD’, which we treat as response values of 3, 2
and 1. In total 2885 sentences were used in the re-
gression training. The ranking model was trained by
sentences with human annotating sentence ranking,
and tied results are allowed in training. In this exper-
iment, 1675 groups of sentences were used for train-
ing, and each group contains five sentences, which

are manually ranked from 5 (best) to 1 (worst). In or-
der to test the ROSE’s ability to adapt the language
without training data, ROSE was only trained with
English data.

The testing data on sentence level used in this
paper is human ranked sentences from WMT09
(Callison-Burch et al., 2009). Tied rankings were re-
moved, leaving 1702 pairs. We only consider trans-
lations into English sentences. On system level, the
testing data are the submissions for ’test2008’ test
set in WMT08 (Callison-Burch et al., 2008). ROSE,
and BLEU were compared with human ranked sub-
mitted system in ‘RANK’, ‘CONSTITUENT’ and
‘YES/NO’ tasks.

English punctuation and 100 common function
words list of four languages in this experiment were
generated. English POS was tagged by NLTK (Bird
and Loper, 2004).

4.2 Results and Discussion

Table 3 shows the results of ROSE-reg with three
different SVM Kernel functions. Performance are
similar among three different Kernel functions.
However, the linear kernel is the fastest and simplest
and there is no overall winner. Therefore, linear Ker-
nel function was used in ROSE.

The results of Kendall’s tau on sentence level
evaluation are shown in Table 4. According to Ta-
ble 4 ROSE-rank has the highest score in all ver-
sions of ROSE. The score is close to the smoothed
version of BLEU. Results also showed adding POS
feature helped in improving accuracy in the regres-
sion model, but not in ranking, The reason for this is
not clear, but it may be due to over fitting.

Table 5 and Table 6 are the Spearman’s rho in sys-
tem ranking. Table 5 is the task evaluation for trans-
lation into English. ROSE-rank performed the best
in the system ranking task. Also, ROSE-regpos is
the best in the syntactic constituents task. This may
because of ROSE-rank is a ranking based metric and
ROSE-regpos incorporates POS that contains more
linguistic information. Table 6 shows the results of
evaluating translations from English. According to
the table, ROSE performs less accurately than for
the into-English tasks, but overall the ROSE scores
are similar to those of BLEU.

5 Conclusion

We presented the ROSE metric to make up for sev-
eral drawbacks of BLEU and other trained metrics.
Features including string matching, words ratio and
POS were combined by the supervised learning ap-
proach. ROSE’s overall performance was close to
BLEU on system level and sentence level. However,
it is better on tasks ROSE was specifically trained,
such as ROSE-rank in the system level ranking task
and ROSE-regpos in the syntactic constituents task.
Results also showed that when training data is not
available in the right language ROSE produces rea-
sonable results.

Smoothed BLEU slightly outperformed ROSE in
sentence evaluation. This might be due to the train-
ing data not being expert judgments, and conse-
quently very noisy. In further work, we shall mod-
ify the training method to better tolerate noise. In
addition, we will modify ROSE by substitute less
informative features with more informative features
in order to improve its performance and reduce over
fitting.
