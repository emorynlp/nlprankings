Abstract
In this paper we apply the multi-way de-
composition method PARAFAC in order to
detect the most prominent sound changes
in dialect variation. We investigate various
phonetic patterns, both in stressed and un-
stressed syllables. We proceed from regu-
lar sound correspondences which are auto-
matically extracted from the aligned tran-
scriptions and analyzed using PARAFAC.
This enables us to analyze simultaneously
the co-occurrence patterns of all sound
correspondences found in the data set and
determine the most important factors of
the variation. The first ten dimensions are
examined in more detail by recovering the
geographical distribution of the extracted
correspondences. We also compare dia-
lect divisions based on the extracted cor-
respondences to the divisions based on the
whole data set and to the traditional schol-
arship as well. The results show that PAR-
AFAC can be successfully used to detect
the linguistic basis of the automatically
obtained dialect divisions.

1 Introduction

Dialectometry is a multidisciplinary field that uses
quantitative methods in the analysis of dialect
data. From the very beginning, most of the re-
search in dialectometry has been focused on the
identification of dialect groups and development
of methods that would tell us how similar (or dif-
ferent) one variety is when compared to the neigh-
boring varieties. Dialect data is usually analyzed
on the aggregate level by summing up the differ-
ences between various language varieties into a
single number. The main drawback of aggregate
analyses is that it does not expose the underlying
linguistic structure, i.e. the specific linguistic ele-
ments that contributed to the differences between

the dialects. In recent years there have been sev-
eral attempts to automatically extract linguistic
basis from the aggregate analysis, i.e. to determine
which linguistic features are responsible for which
dialect divisions. Although interesting for dialect-
ology itself, this kind of research is very important
in the investigation of sound variation and change,
both on the synchronic and diachronic level.

The paper is structured as follows. In the next
section, we discuss a number of earlier approaches
to the problem of identifying underlying linguistic
structure in dialect divisions. In section 3, we give
a description of the dialect data used in this re-
search. Section 4 then describes the methodology
of our method, explaining our data representation
using tensors, our three-way factorization method,
and the design of our data set. In section 5, the res-
ults of our method are discussed, examining the
values that come out of our factorization method
in a number of ways. Section 6, then, draws con-
clusions and gives some pointers for future work.

2 Previous work

In order to detect the linguistic basis of dialect
variation Nerbonne (2006) applied factor analysis
to the results of the dialectometric analysis of
southern American dialects. The analysis is based
on 1132 different vowels found in the data. 204
vowel positions are investigated, where a vowel
position is, e.g., the first vowel in the word ’Wash-
ington’ or the second vowel in the word ’thirty’.
Factor analysis has shown that 3 factors are most
important, explaining 35% of the total amount of
variation. However, this approach is based only on
vowel positions in specific words.

Prokić (2007) extracted the 10 most frequent
non-identical sound correspondences from the
aligned word transcriptions. Based on the relative
frequency of each of these correspondences each
site in the data set was assigned a correspondence
index. Higher value of this index indicates sites

46



where the presence of a certain sound is domin-
ant with respect to some sound alternation. Al-
though successful in describing some important
sound alternations in the dialect variation, it ex-
amines only the 10 most frequent sound alterna-
tions without testing patterns of variation between
different sound correspondences.

Shackleton (2007) applies principal compon-
ent analysis (PCA) to a group of self constructed
articulation-based features. All segments found in
the data are translated into vectors of numerical
features and analyzed using PCA. Based on the
component scores for features, different groups
of varieties (in which a certain group of features
is present) are identified. We note that the main
drawback of this approach is the subjectivity of the
feature selection and segment quantification.

Wieling and Nerbonne (2009) used a bipart-
ite spectral graph partitioning method to simul-
taneously cluster dialect varieties and sound cor-
respondences. Although promising, this method
compares the pronunciation of every site only to
the reference site, rather than comparing it to all
other sites. Another drawback of this method is
that it does not use any information on the frequen-
cies of sound correspondences, but instead em-
ploys binary features to represent whether a cer-
tain correspondence is present at a certain site or
not.

In this paper we present an approach that tries
to overcome some of the problems described in
the previous approaches. It proceeds from auto-
matically aligned phonetic transcriptions, where
pronunciations of every site are compared to the
corresponding pronunciations for all other sites.
Extracted sound correspondences are analyzed us-
ing the multi-way decomposition method PARA-
FAC. The method allows us to make generaliza-
tions over multi-way co-occurrence data, and to
look simultaneously at the co-occurrence patterns
of all sound correspondences found in the data set.

3 Data description

The data set used in this paper consists of phon-
etic transcriptions of 152 words collected at 197
sites evenly distributed all over Bulgaria. It is part
of the project Buldialect – Measuring Linguistic
unity and diversity in Europe. Phonetic transcrip-
tions include various diacritics and suprasegment-
als, making the total number of unique phones in

the data set 95: 43 vowels and 52 consonants.1

The sign for primary stress is moved to a cor-
responding vowel, so that there is a distinction
between stressed and unstressed vowels. Vowels
are also marked for their length. Sonorants /r/ and
/l/ have a mark for syllabicity and for stress in case
they are syllabic. Here we list all phones present
in the data set:
"A, e, i, "e, @, "E, 7, "6, A, I, o, "o, u, "A:, U, "u:, "7, "@,
"a, "i, "I, "e:, E, "O, "2, "i:, "u, e:, 1, "1, "o:, "E:, "7:, u:, A:,
y, "a:, a, o:, 7:, "U, "y, "I:, j, g, n, nj, é, r, w, x, rj, h,

Each of the 152 words in the data set shows
phonetic variation, with some words displaying
more than one change. There are in total 39 dif-
ferent dialectal features that are represented in the
data set, with each of the features being present in
a similar number of words. For example, the re-
flexes of Old Bulgarian vowels that show dialect
variation are represented with the same or nearly
the same number of words. A more detailed de-
scription of all features can be found in Prokić et
al. (2009). For all villages only one speaker was
recorded. In the data set, for some villages there
were multiple pronunciations of the same word. In
this reasearch we have randomly picked only one
per every village.

4 Methodology

4.1 Tensors

Co-occurrence data (such as the sound corres-
pondences used in this research) are usually rep-
resented in the form of a matrix. This form is per-
fectly suited to represent two-way co-occurrence
data, but for co-occurrence data beyond two
modes, we need a more general representation.
The generalization of a matrix is called a tensor.
A tensor is able to encode co-occurrence data of
any n modes. Figure 1 shows a graphical com-
parison of a matrix and a tensor with three modes
– although a tensor can easily be generalized to
more than three modes.

Tensor operations come with their own algeb-
raic machinery. We refer the interested reader to
Kolda and Bader (2009) for a thorough and in-
sightful introduction to the subject.

4.2 PARAFAC
In order to create a succinct and generalized
model, the co-occurrence data are often ana-
lyzed with dimensionality reduction techniques.
One of the best known dimensionality reduction
techniques is principal component analysis (PCA,
Pearson (1901)). PCA transforms the data into a
new coordinate system, yielding the best possible
fit in a least squares sense given a limited num-
ber of dimensions. Singular value decomposition
(SVD) is the generalization of the eigenvalue de-
composition used in PCA (Wall et al., 2003).

To be able to make generalizations among the
three-way co-occurrence data, we apply a statist-
ical dimensionality reduction technique called par-
allel factor analysis (PARAFAC, Harshman (1970);
Carroll and Chang (1970)), a technique that has
been sucessfully applied in areas such as psycho-
logy and bio-chemistry. PARAFAC is a multilinear
analogue of SVD. The key idea is to minimize the
sum of squares between the original tensor and the
factorized model of the tensor. For the three mode
case of a tensor T ∈ RD1×D2×D3 this gives the
objective function in 1, where k is the number of
dimensions in the factorized model and ◦ denotes
the outer product.

(1)

The algorithm results in three matrices, indic-
ating the loadings of each mode on the factorized
dimensions. The model is represented graphically
in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 visualizes the fact
that the PARAFAC decomposition consists of the
summation over the outer products of n (in this
case three) vectors. Figure 3 represents the three
resulting matrices that come out of the factoriza-
tion, indicating the loadings of each mode on the

factorized dimensions. We will be using the latter
representation in our research.

Computationally, the PARAFAC model is fitted
by applying an alternating least-squares algorithm.
In each iteration, two of the modes are fixed and
the third one is fitted in a least squares sense. This
process is repeated until convergence.2

4.3 Sound correspondences
In order to detect the most important sound vari-
ation within Bulgarian dialects, we proceed from
extracting all sound correspondences from the
automatically aligned word transcriptions. All
transcriptions were pairwise aligned using the
Levenshtein algorithm (Levenshtein, 1965) as im-
plemented in the program L04.3 The Leven-
shtein algorithm is a dynamic programming al-
gorithm used to measure the differences between
two strings. The distance between two strings is
the smallest number of insertions, deletions, and
substitutions needed to transform one string to the
other. In this work all three operations were as-
signed the same value, namely 1. The algorithm is
also directly used to align two sequences. An ex-
ample showing two aligned pronunciations of the
word vъlna /v7lna/ ‘wool’ is given in Figure 4.4

the Tensor Toolbox for sparse tensor calculations (Bader and
Kolda, 2009).

4For some pairs of transcriptions there are two or more

possible alignments, i.e. alignments that have the same cost.
In these cases we have randomly picked only one of them.

all corresponding non-identical sounds. For ex-
ample, from the aligned transcriptions in Figure 4
we would extract the following sound pairs: ["7]-
["A], [-]-[l], [A]-[@]. The hyphen (‘-’) stands for a
missing (i.e. inserted or deleted) sound, and in fur-
ther analyses it is treated the same as any sound
in the data set. For each pair of corresponding
sounds from the data set we counted how often it
appeared in the aligned transcriptions for each pair
of villages separately. In total we extracted 907
sound correspondences and stored the information
on each of them in a separate matrix. Every matrix
records the distances between each two villages
in the data set, measured as the number of times
a certain phonetic alternation is recorded while
comparing pronunciations from these sites.

Since we are interested in analyzing all sound
correspondences simultaneously, we merged the
information from all 907 two-mode matrices into
a three-mode tensor n×n×v, where n represents
the sites in the data set, and v represents the sound
alternations. By arranging our data in a cube in-
stead of a matrix, we are able to look into several
sets of variables simultaneously. We are especially
interested in the loadings for the third mode, that
contains the values for the sound correspondences.

5 Results

In order to detect the most prominent sound cor-
respondences we analyzed the three-mode tensor
described in the previous section using a PARAFAC
factorization with k = 10 dimensions. In Table 5

we present only the first five dimensions extracted
by the algorithm. The final model fits 44% of the
original data. The contribution of the first extrac-
ted dimension (dim1) to the final fit of the model
is the largest – 23.81 per cent – while the next four
dimensions contribute to the final fit with similar
percentages: dim2 with 10.63 per cent, dim3 with
9.50 per cent, dim4 with 9.26 per cent, and dim5
with 9.09 per cent. Dimensions six to ten contrib-
ute in the range from 8.66 per cent to 6.98 per cent.

For every dimension we extracted the twenty
sound correspondences with the highest scores. In
the first dimension we find 11 pairs involving vow-
els and 9 involving consonant variation. The three
sound correspondences with the highest scores
are the [A]-[@], [o]-[u], and [e]-[i] alternations.
This finding corresponds well with the traditional
scholarly views on Bulgarian phonetics (Wood
and Pettersson, 1988; Barnes, 2006) where we find
that in unstressed syllables mid vowels [e] and [o]
raise to neutralize with the high vowels [i] and [u].
The low vowel [a] raises to merge with [@].

For every sound alternation we also check their
geographical distribution. We do so by applying
the following procedure. From the aligned pairs
of transcriptions we extract corresponding pairs of
sounds for every alternation. We count how many
times each of the two sounds appears in the tran-
scriptions for every village. Thus, for every pair of
sound correspondences, we can create two maps
that show the distribution of each of the sounds
separately. On the map of Bulgaria these values

are represented using a gradual color, which en-
ables us to see not only the geographic distribution
of a certain sound but also how regular it is in a
given sound alternation. The highest scoring sites
are coloured black and the lowest scoring sites are
coloured white.

In Figure 5 we see the geographical distribu-
tion of the first three extracted correspondences.
The first two alternations [A]-[@] and [o]-[u] have
almost the same geographical distribution and di-
vide the country into west and east. While in the
west there is a clear presence of vowels [A] and [o],
in the east those vowels would be pronounced as
[@] and [u]. The division into east and west corres-
ponds well with the so-called jat line, which is,
according to traditional dialectologists (Stojkov,
2002) the main dialect border in Bulgaria. On the
maps in Figure 5 we represent it with the black line
that roughly divides Bulgaria into east and west.
The third correspondence follows a slightly dif-
ferent pattern: mid vowel [e] is present not only
west of the jat line, but also in the southern part
of the country, in the region of Rodopi mountains.
In the central and northeastern areas this sound is

pronounced as high vowel [i]. For all three sound
correspondences we see a clear two-way division
of the country, with almost all sites being charac-
terized by one of the two pronunciations, which,
as we shall see later, is not always the case due
to multiple reflections of some sounds at certain
positions.

We also note that the distribution of the sound
correspondences that involve soft consonants and
their counterparts have the same east-west dis-
tribution (see Figure 6). In the first dimension
we find the following consonants and their pal-
atal counterparts [n], [d], [l], [v] and [r], but be-
cause of space limitations we show maps only
for three correspondences. The east-west division
also emerges with respect to the distribution of the
[A]-[7] and ["e]-["A] sounds.

Unlike the correspondences mentioned before,
the [S]-[C], [

>
Ù]-[

>
ťC], and [Z]-[ý] pairs are defining

the south part of the country as a separate zone.
As shown on the maps in Figure 7, the southern
part of the country (the region of Rodopi moun-
tains) is characterized by a soft pronunciation of
[S], [

>
Ù] and [Z]. In traditonal literature on Bul-

garain dialectology (Stojkov, 2002), we also find
that soft pronunciation of [S], [

>
Ù] and [Z] is one of

the most important phonetic features of the variet-
ies in the Rodopi zone. Based on the correspond-
ences extracted in the first dimension, this area
is also defined by the presence of the vowel ["E]
in stressed syllables (["e]-["E] and ["A]-["E] corres-
pondences).

In some extracted correspondences, only one of
the sounds has a geographically coherent distri-
bution, like in the case of the [7]-[e] pair where
[e] is found in the west and south, while the [7]
sound is only sporadically present in the central
region. This kind of asymmetrical distribution is
also found with respect to the pair [A]-[7].

Most of the sound correspondences in the first
dimension either divide the country along the jat
line or separate the Rodopi area from the rest of the
varieties. The only two exceptions are the [-]-[j]
and ["7]-["O] pairs. They both define the southwest
area as a separate zone, while the northwest shares
its pronunciation of the sound in question with the
eastern part of the country.

We use the first 20 correspondences from the
first dimension and perform k-means clustering in
order to check which dialect areas would emerge
based on this limited set of sound correspond-

50

ences. The results of the 2-way, 3-way and 4-way
clustering are given in Figure 8.

In two-way clustering the algorithm detects an
east-west split approximately along the jat line,
slightly moved to the east. This fully corres-
ponds to the traditional dialectology but also to
the results obtained using Levenshtein algorithm
on the whole data set where only east, west and
south varieties could be asserted with great con-
fidence (Prokić and Nerbonne, 2008). In Figure 9
we present the dialect divisions that we get if the
distances between the sites are calculated using
whole word transcriptions instead of only the 20
most prominent sound correspondences. We no-
tice a high correspondence between the two ana-
lyses at the two- and three-level division. On the
level of four and more groups, the two analyses
start detecting different groups. In the analysis
based on 20 sound correspondences, southern dia-

lects are divided into smaller and smaller groups,
while in the analysis based on the whole data set,
the area in the west – near the Serbian border –
emerges as the fourth group. This is no surprise, as
the first 20 extracted correspondences do not con-
tain any sounds typical only for this western area.

In order to compare two divisions of sites, we
calculated the adjusted Rand index (Hubert and
Arabie, 1985). The adjusted Rand index (ARI) is
used in classification for comparing two different
partitions of a finite set of objects. It is based on
the Rand index (Rand, 1971), one of the most pop-
ular measures for comparing the degree to which
partitions agree (in classification). Value 1 of the
ARI indicates that two classifications match per-
fectly, while value 0 means that two partitions do
not agree on any pair of points. For both two-
level and three-level divisions of the sites the ARI
for two classifications is 0.84. We also compared

both of the classifications to the classification of
the sites done by Stojkov (2002). For the classi-
fication based on the first dimension extracted by
PARAFAC, ARI is 0.73 for two-way and 0.64 for
the three-way division. ARI score for the clas-
sification based on whole word transcriptions is
0.69 for two-way and 0.62 for three-way. As in-
dicated by ARI the two classifications correspond
with a high degree to each other, but to the tra-
ditional classification as well. We note that two-
way classification based on the extracted sound
correspondences corresponds higher to the tradi-
tional classification than classification that takes
all sounds into account.

We conclude that the sound correspondences
detected by PARAFAC form the linguistic basis
of the two-way and three-way divisions of Bul-
garian dialect area. Using the PARAFAC method
we are able to detect that the most important sound

changes on which two-way division is based are
[o]-[u], [A]-[@] and palatal pronunciation of con-
sonants. In the three-way division of sites done
by k-means, the area in the south of the country
appears as the third most important dialect zone.
In the twenty investigated sound correspondences
we find that the soft pronunciation of [S],[

>
Ù] and

[Z] sounds is typical only for the varieties in this
area. Apart from divisions that divide the country
into west and east, including the southern variet-
ies, we also detect sound correspondences whose
distribution groups together western and southern
areas.

We also analyzed in more depth sound corres-
pondences extracted in other dimensions by the
PARAFAC algorithm. Most of the correspondences
found in the first dimension, also reappear in the
following nine dimensions. Closer inspection of
the language groups obtained using information

52



from these dimensions show that eastern, western
and southern varieties are the only three that are
identified. No other dialect areas were detected
based on the sound correspondences from these
nine dimensions.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have applied PARAFAC in the task
of detecting the linguistic basis of dialect phonetic
variation. The distances between varieties were
expressed as a numerical vector that records in-
formation on all sound correspondences found in
the data set. Using PARAFAC we were able to ex-
tract the most important sound correspondences.
Based on the 20 most important sound correspond-
ences we performed clustering of all sites in the
data set and were able to detect three groups of
sites. As found in traditional literature on Bul-
garian dialects, these three dialects are the main
dialect groups in Bulgaria. Using the aggregate
approach on the same data set, the same three dia-
lects were the only groups in the data that could be
asserted with high confidence. We conclude that
this approach is successful in extracting underly-
ing linguistic structure in dialect variation, while
at the same time overcoming some of the problems
found in the earlier approaches to this problem.

In future work sounds in the data set could be
defined in a more sophisticated way, using some
kind of feature representation. Also, the role of
stress should be examined in more depth, since
there are different patterns of change in stressed
in unstressed syllables. We would also like to ex-
tend the method and examine more than just two
sound correspondences at a time.
