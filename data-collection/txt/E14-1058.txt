Abstract 

The question of data reliability is of first im-
portance to assess the quality of manually an-
notated corpora. Although Cohen’s κ is the 
prevailing reliability measure used in NLP, al-
ternative statistics have been proposed. This 
paper presents an experimental study with four 
measures (Cohen’s κ, Scott’s π, binary and 
weighted Krippendorff ’ s α) on three tasks: 
emotion, opinion and coreference annotation. 
The reported studies investigate the factors of 
influence (annotator bias, category prevalence, 
number of coders, number of categories) that 
should affect reliability estimation. Results 
show that the use of a weighted measure re-
stricts this influence on ordinal annotations. 
They suggest that weighted α is the most reli-
able metrics for such an annotation scheme. 

1 Introduction 

The newly intensive use of machine learning 
techniques as well as the need of evaluation data 
has led Natural Language Processing (NLP) to 
develop large annotated corpora. The interest for 
such enriched language resources has reached 
domains (semantics, pragmatics, affective com-
puting) where the annotation process is highly 
affected by the coders subjectivity. The reliabil-
ity of the resulting annotations must be trusted by 
measures that assess the inter-coders agreement. 
While medecine, psychology, and more gener-
ally content analysis, have considered for years 
the issue of data reliability, NLP has only inves-
tigated this question from the mid 1990s. The 
influential work of Carletta (1996) has led the κ 
statistic (Cohen, 1960) to become the prevailing 
standard for measuring the reliability of corpus 
annotation. Many studies have however ques-
tioned the limitations of the κ statistic and have 
proposed alternative measures of reliability. 
Krippendorff claims that “popularity of κ not-
withstanding, Cohen’s κ is simply unsuitable as 

a measure of the reliability of data” in a paper 
presenting his α coefficient (Krippendorff, 
2008).  

Except for some rare but noticeable studies 
(Arstein and Poesio, 2005), most of these critical 
works restrict to theoretical issues about chance 
agreement estimation or limitations due to vari-
ous statistical biases (Arstein and Poesio, 2008). 
On the opposite, this paper investigates experi-
mentally these questions on three different tasks: 
emotion, opinion and coreference annotation. 
Four measures of reliability will be considered: 
Cohen’s κ (Cohen, 1960), Scott’s π (Scott, 1955) 
and two measures of Krippendorff’s α (Krippen-
dorff, 2004) with different distance.  

 Section 2 gives a comprehensive presentation 
of these metrics. Section 3 details the potential 
methodological biases that should affect the reli-
ability estimation. In section 4, we explain the 
methodology we followed for this study. Lastly, 
experimental results are presented in section 5. 

2 Reliability measures 

Any reliability measure considers the most perti-
nent criterion to estimate data reliability to be 
reproducibility. Reproducibility can be estimated 
by observing the agreement among independent 
annotators (Krippendorff, 2004): the more the 
coders agree on the data they have produced, the 
more their annotations are likely to be repro-
duced by any other set of coders.  

Pure observed agreement is not considered as 
a good estimator since it does not give any ac-
count to the amount of chance that yields to this 
agreement. For instance, a restricted number of 
coding categories should favor chance agree-
ment. What must be estimated is the proportion 
of observed agreement beyond the one that is 
expected by chance:

where Ao is the observed agreement between 
coders and Ae is an estimation of the possible 
chance agreement. Reliability metrics differ by 
the way they estimate this chance agreement. 

Cohen’s κκκκ (Cohen, 1960) defines chance as 
the statistical independence of the use of coding 
categories by the annotators. It postulates that 
chance annotation is governed by prior distribu-
tions that are specific to each coder (annotator 
bias). κ was originally developed for two coders 
and nominal data. (Davies and Fleiss, 1982) has 
proposed a generalization to any number of cod-
ers, while (Cohen, 1968) has defined a weighted 
version of the κ measure that fulfils better the 
need of reliability estimation for ordinal annota-
tions: the disagreement between two ordinal an-
notations is no more binary, but depends on a 
Euclidian distance. This weighted generalization 
restricts however to a two coders scheme (Art-
stein and Poesio, 2008): a weighted version of 
the multi-coders κ statistics is still missing. 

Unlike Cohen’s κ, Scott’s ππππ (Scott, 1955) 
does not aim at modelling annotator bias. It de-
fines chance as the statistical independence of 
the data and the set of coding categories, inde-
pendently from the coders. It considers therefore 
the annotation process and not the behaviour of 
the annotators. Scott’s original proposal con-
cerned only two coders. (Fleiss 1971) gave a 
generalisation of the statistics to any number of 
coders through a measure of pairwise agreement.  

Krippendorff‘s αααα (Krippendorff, 2004) con-
siders chance independently from coders like 
Scott’s π, but data reliability is estimated de-
pending on disagreement instead of agreement: 

(2)  Alpha  = 
e

where Do is the observed disagreement be-
tween coders and De is an estimation of the pos-
sible chance disagreement. Another original as-
pect of this metrics is to allow disagreement es-
timation between two categories through any 
distance measure. This implies that α handles 
directly any number of coders and any kind of 
annotation (nominal or ordinal coding scheme). 
In this paper, we will consider the α statistics 
with a binary as well as a Euclidian distance, in 
order to assess separately the influence of the 
distance measure and the metrics by itself. 

3 Quality criteria for reliability metrics 

There is an abundant literature about the criteria 
of quality a reliability measure should satisfy 

(Hayes, 2007). These works emphasize on two 
important points: 

• A trustworthy measure should provide sta-
ble results: measures must be reasonably 
independent of any factor of influence. 

• The magnitude of the measure must be in-
terpreted in terms of absolute level of reli-
ability: the statistics must come up with 
trustworthy reliability thresholds. 

These questions have mainly been investigated 
from a theoretical point of view. This section 
summarizes the main conclusions that should be 
drawn from these critical studies.  

3.1 Annotator bias and number of coders 

Annotator bias refers to the influence of the idio-
syncratic behavior of the coders. It can be esti-
mated by a bias index which measures the extent 
to which the distribution of categories differs 
from one coder’s annotation to another (Sim and 
Wright, 2005). Annotator bias has an influence 
on the magnitude of the reliability measures 
(Feinstein and Cicchetti,1990). Besides, it con-
cerns the invariance of the measures to the per-
mutation or selection of annotators but also to the 
number of coders. A review of the literature 
shows that theoretical studies on annotator bias 
are not convergent. In particular, opposite argu-
ments have been proposed concerning Cohen’s κ 
(Di Eugenio and Glass 2004, Arstein and Poesio 
2008, Hayes, 2007). This is why we have carried 
on experiments that investigate: 

•  to what extent measures depend on the se-
lection of a specific set of coders (§ 5.3), 

•  to what extent the stability of the measures 
depends on the number of coders (§ 5.4). 
Arstein and Poesio (2005) have shown 
that the greater the number of coders is, 
the lower the annotator bias decreases. 
Our aim is to go further this conclusion: 
we will study whether one measure needs 
fewer coders than another one to converge 
towards an acceptable annotator bias. 

3.2 Category prevalence 

Prevalence refers to the influence on reliability 
estimation of a coding category under which a 
disproportionate amount of annotated data falls. 
It can be estimated by a prevalence index which 
measures the frequency differences of categories 
on cases where the coders agree (Sim and 
Wright, 2005). When the prevalence index is 

551



high, chance-corrected measures are spuriously 
reduced since chance agreement is higher in this 
situation (Brennan and Sliman, 1992; Di Eugenio 
and Glass, 2004). This yields some authors to 
propose corrected coefficients like the PABAK 
measure (Byrt and al., 1993), which is a preva-
lence adjusted and annotator bias adjusted ver-
sion of Cohen’s κ. The influence of prevalence 
will not be investigated here, since no category is 
significantly prevalent in our data. 

3.3 Number of coding categories 

The number of coding categories has an influ-
ence on the reliability measures magnitude: the 
larger the number of categories is, the less the 
coders have a chance to agree. Even if this de-
crease should concern chance agreement too, 
lower reliability estimations are observed with 
high numbers of categories (Brenner and 
Kliebsch, 1996). This paper investigates this in-
fluence by comparing reliability values obtained 
with a 3-categories and a 5-categories coding 
scheme applied on the same data (see § 5.1). 

3.4  Interpreting the magnitude of meas-
ures in terms of effective reliability 

One last question concerns the interpretation of 
the reliability measures magnitude. It has been 
particularly investigated with Cohen’s κ. Carletta 
(1996) advocates 0.8 to be a threshold of good 
reliability, while a value between 0.67 and 0.8 is 
considered sufficient to allow tentative conclu-
sion to be drawn. On the opposite, Krippendorff 
(2004b) claims that this 0.67 cutoff is a pretty 
low standard while Neuendorf (2002) supports 
an even more restrictive interpretation.  

Thus, the definition of relevant levels of reli-
ability remains an open problem. We will see 
how our experiments should draw a methodo-
logical framework to answer this crucial issue. 

4 Experiments: methodology  

4.1 Introduction 

We have conducted experiments on three dif-
ferent annotation tasks in order to guarantee an 
appreciable generality of our findings. The first 
two experiments correspond to an ordinal anno-
tation. They concern the affective dimension of 
language (emotion and opinion annotation). They 
have been conducted with naïve coders to pre-
serve the spontaneity of judgment which is 
searched for in affective computing. 

The third experiment concerns coreference 
annotation. It is a nominal annotation that has 

been designed to be used as a comparison with 
the previous ordinal annotations tasks. 

The corresponding annotated corpora are 
available (TestAccord database) on the french 
Parole_Publique1 corpus repository under a CC-
BY-SA Creative Commons licence. 

4.2 Emotion corpus 

Emotion annotation consists in adding emo-
tional information to written messages or speech 
transcripts. There is no real consensus about how 
an emotion has to be described in an annotation 
scheme. Two main approaches can be found in 
the literature. On the one hand, emotions are 
coded by affective modalities (Scherer, 2005), 
among which sadness, disgust, enjoyment, fear, 
surprise and anger are the most usual (Ekman, 
1999; Cowie and Cornelius, 2003). On the other 
hand, an ordinal classification in a multidimen-
sional space is considered. Several dimensions 
have been proposed among which three are pre-
vailing (Russell, 1980): valence, intensity and 
activation. Activation distinguishes passive from 
active emotional states. Valence describes 
whether the emotional state conveyed by the text 
is positive, negative or neutral. Lastly, intensity 
describes the level of emotion conveyed.  

Whatever the approach, low to moderate inter-
annotator agreements are observed, what ex-
plains that reference annotation must be achieved 
through a majority vote with a significant num-
ber of coders (Schuller and al. 2009). Inter-coder 
agreement is particularly low when emotions are 
coded into modalities (Devillers and al., 2005; 
Callejas and Lopez-Cozar, 2008). This is why 
this study focuses on an ordinal annotation. 

Our works on emotion detection (Le Tallec 
and al., 2011) deal with a specific context: affec-
tive robotics. We consider an affective multimo-
dal interaction between hospitalized children and 
a companion robot. Consequently, this experi-
ment will concern a child-dedicated corpus. Al-
though many works already focused on child 
language (MacWhinney, 2000), no emotional 
child corpus is currently available in French, our 
studied language. We have decided to create a 
little corpus (230 sentences) of fairy tales, which 
are regularly used in works related to child affect 
analysis (Alm and al., 2005; Volkova and al., 
2010). The selected texts come from modern 
fairy tales (Vassallo, 2004; Vanderheyden, 1995) 
which present the interest of being quite confi-
dential. This guarantees that the coders discover

the text during the annotation. We asked 25 sub-
jects to characterize the emotional value con-
veyed by every sentence through a 5-items scale 
of values, ranging from very negative to very 
positive. 

As shown on Table 1, this affective scale en-
compasses valence and intensity dimensions. It 
enables to compare without methodological bias 
an annotation with 3 coding categories (valence: 
negative, positive, neutral) and the original 5-
categories (valence+intensity) annotation. 

A preliminary experiment showed us that 
children meet difficulties to handle a 5-values 
emotional scale. This is why the annotation was 
conducted on the fairy tales corpus with adults 
(11 men/14 women; average age: 31.6 years). All 
the coders have a superior level of education (at 
least, high-school diploma), they did not know 
each other and worked separately during the an-
notation task. Only four of them had a prior ex-
perience in corpus annotation.

Table 1. emotion or opinion annotation schemes 
 
The coders were not trained but were given 

precise annotation guidelines providing some 
explanations and examples on the emotional val-
ues they had to use. They achieved the annota-
tion once, without any restriction on time. They 
had to rely on their own judgment, without con-
sidering any additional information. Sentences 
were given in a random order to investigate an 
out-of-context perception of emotion. We con-
ducted a second experiment where the order of 
the sentences followed the original fairy tale, in 
order to study the influence of the discourse con-
text. The criterion of data significance – at least 
five chance agreements per category – proposed 
by (Krippendorff, 2004) is greatly satisfied for 
the valence annotation (3 categories). It is ap-
proached on the complete annotation where we 
can assure 4 chance agreements per category. 

4.3 Opinion corpus 

The second experiment concerns opinion an-
notation. Emotion detection can be related to a 

certain extent, with opinion mining (or sentiment 
analysis), whose aim is to detect the attitude of 
people in the texts they produce. A basic task in 
opinion mining consists in classifying the polar-
ity of a given text, which should be either a sen-
tence (Wilson and al., 2005), a speech turn or a 
complete document (Turney, 2002). Polarity 
plays the same role as valence does for affect 
analysis: it describes whether the expressed 
judgment is positive, negative, or neutral. One 
should also characterize the sentiment strength 
(Thelwall and al., 2010). This feature can be re-
lated to the notion of intensity used in emotional 
annotation. Both polarity and sentiment strength 
are considered in our annotation task. 

This experiment has been carried out on a cor-
pus of film reviews. The reviews were relatively 
short texts written by ordinary people on dedi-
cated French websites (www.senscritique.com 
and www.allocine.fr). They concerned the same 
French movie. The corpus contains 183 sen-
tences. Its annotation was conducted by the 25 
previous subjects. The methodology is identical 
to the emotion annotation task. The subjects were 
asked to qualify the opinion that was conveyed 
by every sentence of the reviews by means of  
the same scale of values (Table 1). This scale 
encompasses this time the polarity and sentiment 
strength dimensions. Once again, the sentences 
were given in a random order and contextual or-
der respectively. The criterion of data signifi-
cance is satisfied here too. 

On both annotations, experiments with the 
random or the contextual order give similar re-
sults. Results from the contextual annotation will 
be given only when necessary. 

4.4 Coreference corpus 

The last experiment concerns coreference an-
notation. We have developed an annotated cor-
pus (ANCOR) which clusters various types of 
spontaneous and conversational speech. With a 
total of 488,000 lexical units, it is one of the 
largest coreference corpora dedicated to spoken 
language (Muzerelle and al. 2014). Its annotation 
was split into three successive phases: 

• Entity mentions marking, 
• Referential relations marking, 
• Referential relations characterization 

The experiment described in this paper con-
cerns the characterization of the referential rela-
tions. This nominal annotation consists in classi-
fying relations among five different types: 

553



• Direct coreference (DIR) – Coreferent 
mentions are NPs with same lexical heads. 

• Indirect coreference (IND) – These men-
tions are NPs with distinct lexical heads. 

• Pronominal anaphora (PRO) – The subse-
quent coreferent mention is a pronoun. 

• Bridging anaphora (BRI) – The subse-
quent mention does not refer to its antece-
dent but depends on it for its referential in-
terpretation (example: meronymy). 

• Bridging pronominal anaphora (BPA) – 
Bridging anaphora where the subsequent 
mention is a pronoun. This type empha-
sizes metonymies (example: Avoid Cen-
tral Hostel… they are unpleasant) 

The subjects (3 men / 6 women) were adult 
people (average age: 41.2 years) with a high pro-
ficiency in linguistics (researchers in NLP or cor-
pus linguistics). They know each other but 
worked separately during the annotation, without 
any restriction on time. They are considered as 
experts since they participated to the definition 
of the annotation guide. The study was con-
ducted on an extract of 10 dialogues, represent-
ing 384 relations. Krippendorff’s (2004) criterion 
of significance is therefore satisfied here too. 

4.5 Reliability measures 

The experiments have been conducted with four 
chance-balanced reliability measures2 : 

• Multi-κ : multiple coders/binary distance 
Cohen’s κ  (Davies and Fleiss, 1982),  

• Multi-π : multiple coders/binary distance 
Scott’s π  (Fleiss, 1971),  

• αb : Krippendorff’s α with binary distance, 

• α : standard Krippendorff’s α with a 1-
dimension Euclidian distance. 

The use of Euclidian distance is unfounded on 
coreference which handles a nominal annotation. 
Thus, α will not be computed on this last corpus. 
                                                 
2  Experiments were also conducted with Cronbach’αc 
(Cronbach, 1951). This metrics is based on a correlation 
measure. Krippendorff (2009) considers soundly that corre-
lation coefficients are inappropriate to estimate reliability. 
Our results show that αc is systematically outperformed by 
the other metrics. In particular, it is highly dependent to 
coder bias. For instance we observed a relative standard 
deviation of αc measures higher than 22% when measuring 
the influence of coders set permuation (§ 5.3, table 5). This 
observation discards Cronbach’αc as a trustworthy measure. 

5 Results   

5.1 Influence of the number of categories 

Our affective coding scheme enables a direct 
comparison between a 3-classes (valence or po-
larity) and a 5-classes annotation. The 3-classes 
scheme clusters the coding categories with the 
same valence or polarity. For instance {-2,-1} 
negative values are clustered in the same cate-
gory which receive the index 1. For the computa-
tion of the weighted α, the distance between 
negative (-1) and positive (1) classes will be 
equal to 2. Table 2 presents the reliability meas-
ures observed on all of the corpora.

Table 2. Reliability measures: emotion and opinion 

random annotation as well as coreference annotation 
 
Several general conclusions can be drawn 

from these figures. At first, low inter-coder 
agreements are observed on affective annotation, 
which is coherent with many other studies (Dev-
illers and al., 2005; Callejas and Lopez-Cozar, 
2008). Non-weighted metrics (multi-κ, multi-π, 
αb) range from 0.29 to 0.58, depending on the 
annotation scheme. This confirms that these an-
notation tasks are prone to high subjectivity. 
Higher levels of agreement may have been ob-
tained if the annotators were trained with super-
vision. As said before, this would have reduced 
the spontaneity of judgment. Furthermore, a 
comprehensive meta-analysis (Bayerl and Paul, 
2011) has shown that no difference may be found 
on data reliability between experts and novices. 

The reliability measures given by the weighted 
version of Krippendorff’s α on the two affective 
tasks are significantly higher: α values range 
from 0.57 to 0.80, which suggests a rather suffi-
cient reliability. These results are not an artifact. 
They come from better disagreement estimation. 
For instance, the difference between a positive 

554



and a negative annotation is more serious than 
between the positive and the neutral emotion, 
what a weighted metrics accounts for.  

Satisfactory measures are found on the con-
trary on the coreference task (0.69 with every 
metric). This result was expected, since a large 
part of the annotation decisions are based on ob-
jective (syntactic or semantic) considerations.  

Whatever the experiment you consider, multi-
κ, multi-π and αb coefficients present very close 
values (identical until the 3rd decimal). A similar 
observation was made by (Arstein and Poesio, 
2005) with 18 coders. This validates the theoreti-
cal hypothesis on the convergence of individual-
distribution and single-distribution measures 
when the number of coders increases. Our ex-
periments show that annotator bias is moderate 
with 25 coders when inter-coders agreement is 
rather low (affective tasks), while 9 coders are 
enough to guarantee a low annotator bias when 
data reliability is higher (coreference task). 

Lastly, the comparison between the two anno-
tation schemes (3 or 5 classes) in affective tasks 
provides some indications on the influence of the 
number of coding categories on reliability esti-
mation3. As expected (see § 3.3), multi-κ, multi-π 
and αb values increase significantly when the 
number of classes decreases.  

On the contrary, weighted α is significantly 
less affected by the increase of the number of 
categories. The α value remains unchanged on 
the emotional corpus and its variation restricts to 
0.05 on the opinion task. It seems that the use of 
a Euclidian distance counterbalances the higher 
risk of disagreement when the number of catego-
ries grows. Such an independence of the number 
of coding categories is an interesting property for 
a reliability measure, which has never been re-
ported as far as we know.

Finally, Table 3 presents as an illustration the 
reliabilities measures we obtained with the con-
textual annotation of the opinion corpus. These 
                                                 
3 The 3-classes coding scheme is a semantic reduction of the 
5-classes one. One should wonder whether the same results 
can be observed with unrelated categories. (Chu-Ren and 
al., 2002) shows indeed that expanding PoS tags with sub-
categories does not increase categorical ambiguity. 

results are fully coherent with the previous ones. 
One should note in addition that reliability meas-
ures are significantly higher on these contextual 
annotations: the context of discourse helps the 
coders to qualify opinions more objectively. 

5.2 Influence of prevalence 

Table 4 presents the distribution of the annota-
tions on the three corpora. (Devillers and al., 
2005; Callejas and Lopez-Cozar, 2008) reported 
that more than 80% of the speech turns are clas-
sified as neutral in their emotional corpora. This 
prevalence was not found on our affective cor-
pora. Positive annotations are nearly as frequent 
as the neutral ones on the emotion task. This ob-
servation is due to the deliberate emotional na-
ture of fairy tales. Likewise, the neutral opinion 
is minority among the film reviews, which aim 
frequently at expressing pronounced judgments. 
Positive opinions are slightly majority on the 
opinion corpus but this prevalence is limited: it 
represents an increase of only 50% of frequency, 
by comparison with a uniform distribution.

alone. There is no indication in the literature that 
the prevalence of two balanced categories has a 
bias on data reliability measure. For all these rea-
sons, we didn't investigate the influence of preva-
lence. Besides, relevant works are questioning 
the importance of the influence of prevalence on 
inter-coders agreement measures (Vach, 2005). 

5.3 Influence of coders set permutation 

“a coefficient for assessing the reliability of data 
must treat coders as interchangeable (Krippen-
dorff, 2004b). We have studied the stability of 
reliability measures computed on any combina-
tion of 10 coders (among 25) on the affective 
corpora, and 4 coders (among 9) on the corefer-

555



ence corpus. The influence of permutation is 
quantified by a measure of relative standard de-
viation (e.g. related to the average value) among 
the sets of coders (Table 5).   

 

Corpus Emotion (fairy tales) 
Metric M-κκκκ M-ππππ ααααb    αααα    
3-classes 7.4% 7.7% 7.6% 6.2%   
5-classes 9.0% 9.1% 9.1% 6.1%   
Corpus Opinion (film reviews)    
3-classes 3.4% 3.3% 3.3% 2.6% 
5-classes 4.0% 4.0% 4.1% 1.7% 
Corpus Coreference (spoken dialogues)    
5-classes 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% n.c. 

 

Table 5. Relative standard deviation of measures on 
any independent sets of coders 

Binary metrics do not differ on this criterion: 
multi-κ, multi-π and αb present very similar re-
sults. On the opposite, the benefit of a Euclidian 
distance of agreement is clear: α is significantly 
less influenced by coders set permutation. 

5.4 Influence of the number of coders 

A good way to limit annotator bias is to enroll an 
important number of annotators. This need is 
unfortunately contradictory with a restriction of 
annotation costs. The estimation of data reliabil-
ity must thereby remain trustworthy with a 
minimal number of coders. As far as we know, 
there is no clear indication in the literature about 
the definition of such a minimal size. 

We have conducted an experiment which in-
vestigates the influence of the number of coders 
on the relevancy of reliability estimation. Con-
sidering N annotations (N=25 for affective anno-
tation and N=9 for coreference annotation), we 
compute all the possible reliability values with 
any subsets of S coders, S varying from 2 to N. 
As an estimation of the trustworthiness of the 
coefficients, the relative standard deviation of the 
reliability values is computed for every size S 
(Figures 1 to 3). The influence of the number of 
coders is obvious: detrimental standard devia-
tions are found with small coders set sizes. This 
finding concerns above all multi-κ, multi-π and 
αb, which present very close behaviors on all 
annotations. One the opposite, the weighted 
α coefficient converges significantly faster to a 
trustworthy reliability measure The comparison 
between αb and α  is enlightening. It shows again 
that the main benefit of Krippendorff’s proposal 
results from its accounting for a weighted dis-
tance in a multi-coders ordinal annotation.

6 Conclusion and perspectives 

Our experiments were conducted on various an-
notation tasks which assure a certain representa-
tiveness of our conclusions: 
 

• Cohen’s κ, Krippendorff‘s α and Scott’s π 
provide close values when they use the 
same measure of disagreement. 

• A convergence of these measures has been 
noticed in the literature when the number 
of coders is high. We observed it even on 
very restricted sets of annotators. 

• The use of a weighted measure (Euclidian 
distance) has several benefits on ordinal 
data. It restricts the influence on reliability 
measure of both the number of categories 
and the number of coders. Unfortunately, 
Cohen’s κ statistics cannot consider a 
weighted distance in a multi-coders 
framework contrary to Krippendorff’s α.  

• There is no benefit of using Krippendorff‘s 
α on nominal data, since a binary distance 
is mandatory on this situation. 

To conclude, the main interest of Krippen-
dorff’s α is thus its ability to integrate any kind 
of distance. In light of our results, the weighted 
version of this coefficient must be preferred 
every time an ordinal annotation with multiple 
coders is considered. 

Our experiments leave open an essential ques-
tion: the objective definition of trustworthy 
thresholds of reliability. We propose to investi-
gate this question in terms of expected modifica-
tions of the reference annotation. A majority vote 
is generally used as a gold standard to create this 
reference with multiple coders. As a preliminary 
experiment, we have compared our reference 
affective annotations (25 coders) with those ob-
tained on any other included set of coders.

Figure 4. Average modifications of the reference ac-
cording to the number of coders. Emotion annotation 

(top) and opinion annotation (bottom) 
 

Figure 4 presents the average percentage of 
modifications of the reference according to the 
number of coders. We wonder to what extent 
these curves can be related to reliability meas-
ures. It seems indeed that the higher the meas-
ures are, the lower the modifications are too. For 
instance, almost all of the coefficients present 
higher or equal reliability values with 3 coding 
categories (Tables 2 & 3), which corresponds to 
lower levels of modifications on Figure 3. Like-
wise, reliability measures are higher on the opin-
ion annotation, where we observe lower modifi-
cations of the reference.  

As a result, we expect results like those pre-
sented on figure 4 to enable a direct interpreta-
tion of reliability measures. For instance, with a 
multi-κ values of 0.41, or a αb value of 0.57 (Ta-
ble 2, 3-classes emotion annotation), one should 
expect around 8% of errors on our reference an-
notation if 10 coders are considered. We plan to 
extend these experiments with simultated syn-
thetic data to characterize precisely the relations 
between absolute reliability measures and ex-
pected confidence in the reference annotation. 
We expect to obtain with simulated annotation a 
sufficient variety of agreement to establish sound 
recommendations on data reliability thresholds. 
We intend to modify randomly human annota-
tions to conduct this simulation.
