Abstract

We investigate the effect of four different
competitive machine translation systems
on post-editor productivity and behaviour.
The study involves four volunteers post-
editing automatic translations of news sto-
ries from English to German. We see sig-
nificant difference in productivity due to
the systems (about 20%), and even bigger
variance between post-editors.

1 Introduction

Statistical machine translation (SMT) has made
considerable progress over the past two decades.
Numerous recent studies have shown productivity
increases with post-editing of MT output over tra-
ditional work practices in human translation (e.g.,
Guerberof, 2009; Plitt and Masselot, 2010; Garcia,
2011; Pouliquen et al., 2011; Skadiņš et al., 2011;
den Bogaert and Sutter, 2013; Vazquez et al.,
2013; Green et al., 2013; Läubli et al., 2013).

The advances in statistical machine translation
over the past years have been driven to a large ex-
tent by frequent (friendly) competitive MT eval-
uation campaigns, such as the shared tasks at the
ACL WMT workshop series (Bojar et al., 2013)
and IWSLT (Cettolo et al., 2013), and the NIST
Open MT Evaluation.1 These evaluations usu-
ally apply a mix of automatic evaluation metrics,
most prominently the BLEU score (Papineni et al.,
2001), and more subjective human evaluation cri-
teria such as correctness, accuracy, and fluency.

How the quality increases measured by auto-
matic metrics and subjective evaluation criteria re-
late to actual increases in the productivity of post-
editors is still an open research question. It is
also not clear yet if some machine translation ap-
proaches — say, syntax-based models — are bet-
ter suited for post-editing than others. These re-
lationships may very well also depend on the lan-
1 http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/openmt.cfm

guage pair in question and the coarse level of MT
quality, from barely good enough for post-editing
to almost perfect.

The pilot study presented in this paper investi-
gates the influence of the underlying SMT system
on post-editing effort and efficiency. The study
focuses on translation of general news text from
English into German, with translations created by
non-professional post-editors working on output
from four different translation systems. The data
generated by this study is available for download.2

We find that the better systems lead to a produc-
tivity gain of roughly 20% and carry out in-depth
analysis of editing behavior. A significant find-
ing is the high variance in work styles between the
different post-editors, compared to the impact of
machine translation systems.

2 Related Work

Koponen (2012) examined the relationship be-
tween human assessment of post-editing efforts
and objective measures such as post-editing time
and number of edit operations. She found that seg-
ments that require a lot of reordering are perceived
as being more difficult, and that long sentences
are considered harder, even if only few words
changed. She also reports larger variance between
translators in post-editing time than in post-editing
operations — a finding that we confirm here as
well.

From a detailed analysis of the types of ed-
its performed in sentences with long versus short
post-edit times, Koponen et al. (2012) conclude
that the observed differences in edit times can be
explained at least in part also by the types of nec-
essary edits and the associated cognitive effort.
Deleting superfluous function words, for exam-
ple, appears to be cognitively simple and takes
little time, whereas inserting translations for un-
translated words requires more cognitive effort

cal post-editing tasks.
Another study by Koponen (2013) showed that
inter-translator variance is lower in a controlled
language setting when translators are given the
choice of output from three different machine
translation systems.

In the realm of machine translation research,
there has been an increasing interest in the use
of MT technology by post-editors. A major push
are the two EU-funded research projects MATE-
CAT3 and CASMACAT4, which are developing an
open source translation and post-editing work-
bench (Federico et al., 2012; Alabau et al., 2013).

At this point, we are not aware of any study that
compares directly the impact of different machine
translation systems on post-editor productivity and
behaviour.

3 Experimental Design

We thus carried out an experiment on an English–
German news translation task, using output from
four different SMT systems, post-edited by fluent
bilingual native speakers of German with no prior
experience in professional translation.

3.1 The Translation Task

The Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
(Bojar et al., 2013) organises an annual evaluation
campaign for machine translation systems. The
subject matter is translation of news stories from
sources such as the New York Times or the BBC.
We decided to use output from systems submit-
ted to this evaluation campaign, not only because

3 http://www.matecat.com/
4 http://www.casmacat.eu/

their output is freely available,5 but also because
it comes with automatic metric scores and human
judgements of the translation quality.

The translation direction we chose was
English–German, partly due to convenience (the
authors of this study are fluent in both languages),
but also because this language pair poses special
challenges to current machine translation technol-
ogy, due to the syntactic divergence of the two
languages.

We selected data from the most recent evalua-
tion campaign. The subset chosen for our post-
editing task comprises 9 different news stories,
originally written in English, with a total of 500
sentences. Details are shown in Table 1.

3.2 Machine Translation Systems
A total of 15 different machine translation systems
participated in the evaluation campaign. We se-
lected four different systems that differ in their ar-
chitecture and use of training data:

• an anonymized popular online translation
system built by a large Internet company
(ONLINE-B)

• the syntax-based translation system of the
University of Edinburgh (UEDIN-SYNTAX;
Nadejde et al., 2013)

• the phrase-based translation system of the
University of Edinburgh (UEDIN-PHRASE;
Durrani et al., 2013)

• the machine translation system of the Univer-
sity of Uppsala (UU; Stymne et al., 2013)

In the 2013 WMT evaluation campaign, the sys-
tems translated a total of 3000 sentences, and their

uation campaign.

UEDIN-SYNTAX 19.4 0.614

UU 16.1 0.361

output was judged with the BLEU score against a
professional reference translation and by subjec-
tive ranking. The scores obtained for the different
systems on the full test set are shown in Table 2.
The first three systems are fairly close in qual-
ity (although the differences in subjective hu-
man judgement scores are statistically significant),
whereas the fourth system (UU) clearly lags be-
hind. The best system ONLINE-B was ranked first
according to human judgement and thus can be
considered state of the art.

From casual observation, the syntax-based sys-
tem UEDIN-SYNTAX succeeds more frequently
in producing grammatically correct translations.
The phrase-based system UEDIN-PHRASE, even
though trained on the same parallel data, has
higher coverage since it does not have the require-
ment that translation rules have to match syntac-
tic constituents in the target language, which we
presume is the main cause behind the lower BLEU
score. The two systems use the same language
model.

System UU is also a phrase based system, with a
decoder that is able to consider the document level
context. It was trained on smaller corpora for both
the translation model and the language model.

We do not have any insight into the system
ONLINE-B, but we conjecture that it is a phrase-
based system with syntactic pre-reordering trained
on much larger data sets, but not optimised to-
wards the news domain.

Notice the inconsistency between BLEU score
and subjective score for the two systems from the
University of Edinburgh. Results from other eval-
uations have also shown (Callison-Burch et al.,
2012) that current automatic evaluation metrics
do not as much as human judges appreciate the
strengths of the syntax-based system, which builds
syntactic structures in the target language dur-
ing translation. Hence, we were particularly in-
terested how the syntax-based system fares with

post-editors.
As mentioned above, the nine documents chosen
for the post-editing task analysed in this paper (cf.
Table 1) were part of the WMT 2013 evaluation
data set. All nine documents had English as the
original source language.

3.3 Post-Editors

We recruited four English-German bilingual, na-
tive German post-editors. Three were students,
staff, or faculty at the University of Edinburgh;
the fourth had been previously employed on a con-
tractual basis for linguistic annotation work.6 The
post-editors had no professional experience with
translation, and differed in language skills.

3.4 Assignment of MT Output

The goal of this study was to investigate how post-
editors’ behaviour and productivity are influenced
by the quality of the underlying machine transla-
tion system. Ideally, we would want to present
output from different systems to the same post-
editor and see how their observable behaviour
changes.

However, a post-editor who has seen the out-
put from one MT system for a sentence will be
at an advantage when post-editing the output from
a second system, by having already spent signif-
icant time understanding the source sentence and
considering the best translation choices.

Hence we used 4 different post-editors, each to
post-edit the output in equal amounts from each of
the 4 machine translation systems under investiga-
tion, so that each post-editor worked on each sen-
tence once and the entire output from all systems
was post-edited once by one of the 4 post-editors.

A concern in this setup is that we never know
if we measure differences in post-editors or differ-
ences in machine translations systems when com-
paring the behaviour for any given sentence.

Therefore, each post-editor was assigned a
translation for each sentence randomly from any
of the machine translation systems. This random
assignment allows us to marginalise out the depen-
dence on the post-editor when assessing statistics
for the different systems.

6 The ordering here does not reflect the order of post-editors
in the discussion later in this paper.

4 Productivity

The primary argument for post-editing machine
translation output as opposed to more traditional
approaches is the potential gain in productivity. If
translation professionals can work faster with ma-
chine translation, then this has real economic ben-
efits. There are also other considerations, for ex-
ample that post-editing might be done by profes-
sionals that are less skilled in the source language
(Koehn, 2010).

We measure productivity by time spent on each
sentence. This is not a perfect measure. When
working on a news story, post-editors tend to
speed up when moving down the story since they
have already solved some reoccurring translation
problems and get more familiar with the context.

4.1 Productivity by MT System
Our main interests is the average translation speed,
broken down by machine translation system. The
columns labelled “mean” in Table 3 show the re-
sults. While the differences are not big for the top
three systems, the syntax-based system comes out
on top.

We used bootstrap resampling to test the speed
differences for statistical significance. Only sys-
tem UU is significantly worse than the others (at
p-level < 0.01), with about 20% lower productiv-
ity.

4.2 Productivity by Post-Editor
Post-editing speed is very strongly influenced by
the post-editor’s skill and effort. Our post-editors
were very diverse, showing large differences in
translation speed. See the columns labelled 1 to
4 in Table 3 for details.

In particular, post-editor 3 took more than three
times as much time as the fastest (PE 1). Accord-
ing to a post-study interview with Post-Editor 3,
there were two reasons for this. First, the post-
editor was feeling a bit “under the weather” dur-

ing the study and found it hard to focus. Second,
(s)he found the texts very difficult to translate and
struggled with idiomatic expressions and cultural
references that (s)he did not understand immedi-
ately.

4.3 Productivity by System and Post-Editor

While the large differences between the post-
editors are unfortunate when the goal is consis-
tency in results, they provide some data on how
post-editors of different skill levels are influenced
by the quality of the machine translation systems.

Table 3 breaks down translation speed by ma-
chine translation system and post-editor. Interest-
ingly, machine translation quality has hardly any
effect on the fast Post-Editor 1, and the lower
MT performance of system UU affects only Post-
Editors 3 and 4. Post-Editor 2 is noticeably faster
with UEDIN-SYNTAX — an effect that cannot be
observed for the other post-editors. The differ-
ences between the other systems are not large for
any of the post-editors.

Statistically significant — as determined by
bootstrap resampling — are only the differences
in post-editing speed for Post-Editor 3 with sys-
tem UU versus ONLINE-B and UEDIN-PHRASE at
p-level < 0.01, and against UEDIN-SYNTAX at p-
level <0.02, and for Post-Editor 4 for UU versus
UEDIN-PHRASE at p-level < 0.05. Note that the
absence of statistical significance in our data has
much to do with the small sample size; more ex-
tensive experiments may be necessary to ensure
more solid findings.

5 Translation Edit Rate

Given the inherent difficulties in obtaining tim-
ing information, we can also measure the impact
of machine translation system quality on post-
editing effort in terms of how much the post-
editors change the machine translation output, as
done, for example in Cettolo et al. (2013).

41



Table 4: Edit rate and types of edits per system

System HTER ins del sub shift wide shift
ONLINE-B 35.7 4.8 7.4 18.9 4.6 5.8

UEDIN-PHRASE 37.9 5.5 7.4 20.0 5.0 6.6
UEDIN-SYNTAX 36.7 4.7 7.6 19.8 4.6 5.7

UU 43.7 4.6 11.4 21.9 5.8 7.2

Table 5: Edit rate and types of edits per post-editor

2 43.1 4.1 10.4 23.1 5.4 6.9
3 37.7 5.9 7.9 18.8 5.0 6.6
4 37.5 4.3 8.5 19.6 5.1 6.4

There are two ways to measure how much the
machine translation output was edited by the post-
editor. One way is to compare the final translation
with the original machine translation output. This
is what we will do in this section. In Section 6,
we will consider which parts of the final transla-
tion were actually changed by the post-editor and
discuss the difference.

5.1 HTER as Quality Measure

The edit distance between machine translation
output and human reference translation can be
measured in the number of insertions, deletions,
substitutions and (phrasal) moves. A metric that
simply counts the minimal number of such edit op-
erations and divides it by the length of the human
reference translation is the translation edit rate,
short TER (Snover et al., 2006).

If the human reference translation is created
from the machine translation output to minimise
the number of edit operations needed for an ac-
ceptable translation, this variant is called human-
mediated TER, or HTER. Note that in our experi-
ment the post-editors are not strictly trying to min-
imise the number of edit operations — they may
be inclined to make additional changes due to ar-
bitrary considerations of style or perform edits that
are faster rather than minimise the number of oper-
ations (e.g., deleting whole passages and rewriting
them).

5.2 Edits by MT System

Table 4 shows the HTER scores — keep in mind
our desiderata above — for the four systems. The
scores are similar to the productivity number, with
the three leading systems close together and the
trailing system UU well behind.

Notably, we draw more statistically significant
distinctions here. While as above, UU is signif-
icantly worse than all other systems (p-level <
0.01), we also find that ONLINE-B is better than
UEDIN-PHRASE (p-level < 0.01).

Hence, HTER is a more sensitive metric than
translation speed. This may be due to the fact
that the time measurements are noisier than the
count of edit operations. But it may also because
HTER and productivity (i.e., time) do not measure
the exactly the same thing. For instance, edits that
require only a few keystrokes may be cognitively
demanding (e.g., terminological choices), and thus
take more time.

We cannot make any strong claim based on
our numbers, but it is worth pointing out that
post-editing UEDIN-SYNTAX was slightly faster
than ONLINE-B (by 0.08 seconds/word), while the
HTER score is lower (by 1 point). A closer look
at the edit operations reveals that the post-edit
of UEDIN-SYNTAX output required slightly fewer
short and long shifts (movements of phrases), but
more substitutions. Intuitively, moving a phrase
around is a more time-consuming task than replac-
ing a word. The benefit of a syntax-based sys-
tem that aims to produce correct syntactic struc-
ture (including word order), may have real benefits
in terms of post-editing time.

5.3 Edits by Post-Editor

Table 5 displays the edit rate broken down by post-
editor. There is little correlation between edit rate
and post-editor speed. While the fastest Post-
Editor 1 produces translations with the smallest
edit rate, the difference to two of the others (in-
cluded the slowest Post-Editor 3) is not large. The

Figure 1: Analysis of the post-editing process: Most editing actions that result in changes in the transla-
tion are adding or deleting of a character by a keystroke. However, notice the cut (17.986 sec) and paste
(19.386 sec) action. Each character can be traced either to the original machine translation output (m), a
typing action of the post-editor (t), or a pasting action of the post-editor (p). This then allows tokens in
the output classified as either original MT (m), typed (t), pasted (not in figure) or partially edited (x).

outlier here is Post-Editor 2, whose output has a
much larger edit rate.

6 Editing Actions

The HTER is an analysis of the product of post-
editing. The final translation is compared to the
original machine translation output. In this sec-
tion, we examine how the process of post-editing
is influenced by the machine translation system.

Our post-editing workbench provides detailed log-
ging of each HCI interaction (key strokes, mouse
clicks, etc.). This allows us to reconstruct how a
translation was generated. See Figure 1 for an ex-
ample how a translated was edited.

ONLINE-B 68.3 28.0 3.3
UEDIN-PHRASE 62.9 31.3 5.2
UEDIN-SYNTAX 65.9 29.1 4.5
UU 56.1 37.9 5.6

6.1 Character Provenance by System

If we follow the editing actions, we can trace the
origin of each letter in the final output: was it part
of the original MT output, was it typed in by the
user, or moved in a cut and paste action? Table 6
breaks down the characters in the final translations

by origin for each system. The numbers corre-
spond to the HTER scores, with a remarkable con-
sistency ranking for typed and pasted characters.

6.2 Token Provenance by System
We perform a similar analysis on the word level,
introducing a fourth type of provenance: words
whose characters are of mixed origin, i.e., words
that were partially edited. Table 7 shows the num-
bers for each machine translation system. The sus-
picion from the HTER score that the syntax-based
system UEDIN-SYNTAX requires less movement is
not confirmed by these numbers. There are sig-
nificantly more words moved by pasting (3.4%)
than for ONLINE-B (2.3%). In general, cutting and
pasting is not as common as the HTER score would
suggest: the two types of shifts moved 10.3% and
10.2% of phrases, respectively. It seems that most
words that could be moved are rather deleted and
typed again.

6.3 Behaviour By Post-Editor
The post-editors differ significantly in their be-
haviour, as the numbers in Table 8 illustrate. Post-
Editor 1, who is the fastest, leaves the most char-
acters unchanged (72.9% vs. 57.7–64.4% for the
others). Remarkably, this did not result in a dra-
matically lower HTER score (recall: 35.2 vs. 37.5–
43.1 for the others).

Post-Editor 3, while taking the longest time,
does not change the most number of characters.
However, (s)he uses dramatically more cutting and
pasting. Is this activity particularly slow? One
way to check is to examine more closely how the

Table 8: Character provenance by post-editor

Post-Editor MT typed pasted
1 72.9 22.9 3.5
2 57.7 39.4 2.7
3 58.9 29.5 10.7
4 64.4 33.5 1.9

post-editors spread out their actions over time.

7 Editing Activities

Koehn (2009) suggests to divide up the time spent
by translators and post-editors into intervals of the
following types:

• initial pauses: the pause at the beginning of
the translation, if it exists

• end pause: the pause at the end of the trans-
lation, if it exists

• short pause of length 2–6 seconds
• medium pauses of length 6–60 seconds
• big pauses longer than 60 seconds
• various working activities (in our case just

typing and mouse actions)

When we break up the time spent on each activ-
ity and normalise it by the number of words in
the original machine translation output, we get the
numbers in Table 9, per machine translation sys-
tem and post-editor.

The worse quality of the UU system causes
mainly more work activity, big medium pauses.
Each contributes roughly 0.3 seconds per word.
The syntax-based system UEDIN-SYNTAX may
pose fewer hard translation problems (showing up
in initial and big pauses) than the HTER-preferred
ONLINE-B system, but the effect is not strong.

We noted that ONLINE-B has a statistically sig-
nificant better HTER score than UEDIN-PHRASE.
While this is reflected in the additional working
activity for the latter (2.41 sec./word vs. 2.26
sec./word), time is made up in the pauses. Our data
is not sufficiently conclusive to gain any deeper in-
sight here — it is certainly a question that we want
to explore in the future.

The difference in post-editors mirrors some of
the earlier findings: The number of characters and
words changed leads to longer working activity,
but the slow Post-Editor 3 is mainly slowed down
by initial, big and medium pauses, indicating diffi-
culties with solving translation problems, and not
slow cutting and pasting actions. The faster Post-
Editor 1 rarely pauses long and is quick with typ-
ing and mouse movements.

8 Conclusion

We compared how four different machine trans-
lation systems affect post-editing productivity and
behaviour by analysing final translations and user

activity data. The best system under considera-
tion yielded abut 20% better productivity than the
worst, although the three systems on top are not
statistically significantly different in terms of pro-
ductivity.

We noted differences in metrics that measure
productivity and edit distance metrics. The lat-
ter allowed us to draw more statistically significant
conclusions, but may measure something distinct.
Productivity is the main concern of commercial
use of post-editing machine translation, and we
find that better machine translation leads to less
time spent on editing, but more importantly, less
time spent of figuring out harder translation prob-
lems (indicated by pauses of more than six sec-
onds).

Finally, an important finding is that the differ-
ences between post-editors is much larger than the
difference between machine translation systems.
This points towards the importance of skilled post-
editors, but this finding should be validated with
professional post-editors, and not the volunteers
used in this study.
