Abstract

Since larger n-gram Language Model
(LM) usually performs better in Statistical
Machine Translation (SMT), how to con-
struct efficient large LM is an important
topic in SMT. However, most of the ex-
isting LM growing methods need an extra
monolingual corpus, where additional LM
adaption technology is necessary. In this
paper, we propose a novel neural network
based bilingual LM growing method, only
using the bilingual parallel corpus in SMT.
The results show that our method can im-
prove both the perplexity score for LM e-
valuation and BLEU score for SMT, and
significantly outperforms the existing LM
growing methods without extra corpus.

1 Introduction

‘Language Model (LM) Growing’ refers to adding
n-grams outside the corpus together with their
probabilities into the original LM. This operation
is useful as it can make LM perform better through
letting it become larger and larger, by only using a
small training corpus.

There are various methods for adding n-grams
selected by different criteria from a monolingual
corpus (Ristad and Thomas, 1995; Niesler and
Woodland, 1996; Siu and Ostendorf, 2000; Si-
ivola et al., 2007). However, all of these approach-
es need additional corpora. Meanwhile the extra
corpora from different domains will not result in
better LMs (Clarkson and Robinson, 1997; Iyer et
al., 1997; Bellegarda, 2004; Koehn and Schroeder,

2007). In addition, it is very difficult or even im-
possible to collect an extra large corpus for some
special domains such as the TED corpus (Cettolo
et al., 2012) or for some rare languages. There-
fore, to improve the performance of LMs, without
assistance of extra corpus, is one of important re-
search topics in SMT.

Recently, Continues Space Language Model
(CSLM), especially Neural Network based Lan-
guage Model (NNLM) (Bengio et al., 2003;
Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010; Le et al.,
2011), is being actively used in SMT (Schwenk
et al., 2006; Son et al., 2010; Schwenk, 2010;
Schwenk et al., 2012; Son et al., 2012; Niehues
and Waibel, 2012). One of the main advantages
of CSLM is that it can more accurately predic-
t the probabilities of the n-grams, which are not in
the training corpus. However, in practice, CSLM-
s have not been widely used in the current SMT
systems, due to their too high computational cost.

Vaswani and colleagues (2013) propose a
method for reducing the training cost of CSLM
and apply it to SMT decoder. However, they do
not show their improvement for decoding speed,
and their method is still slower than the n-gram
LM. There are several other methods for attempt-
ing to implement neural network based LM or
translation model for SMT (Devlin et al., 2014;
Liu et al., 2014; Auli et al., 2013). However, the
decoding speed using n-gram LM is still state-of-
the-art one. Some approaches calculate the prob-
abilities of the n-grams n-grams before decoding,
and store them in the n-gram format (Wang et al.,
2013a; Arsoy et al., 2013; Arsoy et al., 2014). The
‘converted CSLM’ can be directly used in SMT.
Though more n-grams which are not in the train-

189



ing corpus can be generated by using some of
these ‘converting’ methods, these methods only
consider the monolingual information, and do not
take the bilingual information into account.

We observe that the translation output of a
phrase-based SMT system is concatenation of
phrases from the phrase table, whose probabilities
can be calculated by CSLM. Based on this obser-
vation, a novel neural network based bilingual LM
growing method is proposed using the ‘connecting
phrases’. The remainder of this paper is organized
as follows: In Section 2, we will review the exist-
ing CSLM converting methods. The new neural
network based bilingual LM growing method will
be proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, the exper-
iments will be conducted and the results will be
analyzed. We will conclude our work in Section
5.

2 Existing CSLM Converting Methods

Traditional Backoff N -gram LMs (BNLMs) have
been widely used in many NLP tasks (Zhang and
Zhao, 2013; Jia and Zhao, 2014; Zhao et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2012; Xu and Zhao, 2012; Wang et
al., 2013b; Jia and Zhao, 2013; Wang et al., 2014).
Recently, CSLMs become popular because they
can obtain more accurate probability estimation.

2.1 Continues Space Language Model

A CSLM implemented in a multi-layer neural net-
work contains four layers: the input layer projects
(first layer) all words in the context hi onto the
projection layer (second layer); the hidden layer
(third layer) and the output layer (fourth layer)
achieve the non-liner probability estimation and
calculate the LM probability P (wi|hi) for the giv-
en context (Schwenk, 2007).

CSLM is able to calculate the probabilities of
all words in the vocabulary of the corpus given the
context. However, due to too high computational
complexity, CSLM is mainly used to calculate the
probabilities of a subset of the whole vocabulary
(Schwenk, 2007). This subset is called a short-
list, which consists of the most frequent words in
the vocabulary. CSLM also calculates the sum of
the probabilities of all words not included in the
short-list by assigning a neuron with the help of
BNLM. The probabilities of other words not in the
short-list are obtained from an BNLM (Schwenk,
2007; Schwenk, 2010; Wang et al., 2013a).

Let wi and hi be the current word and history,

respectively. CSLM with a BNLM calculates the
probability P (wi|hi) of wi given hi, as follows:

P (wi|hi) =


Pc(wi|hi)∑
w∈V0 Pc(w|hi)

Ps(hi) if wi ∈ V0

Pb(wi|hi) otherwise
(1)

where V0 is the short-list, Pc(·) is the probabil-
ity calculated by CSLM,

∑
w∈V0 Pc(w|hi) is the

summary of probabilities of the neuron for all the
words in the short-list, Pb(·) is the probability cal-
culated by the BNLM, and

Ps(hi) =
∑
v∈V0

Pb(v|hi). (2)

We may regard that CSLM redistributes the
probability mass of all words in the short-list,
which is calculated by using the n-gram LM.

2.2 Existing Converting Methods

As baseline systems, our approach proposed in
(Wang et al., 2013a) only re-writes the probabil-
ities from CSLM into the BNLM, so it can only
conduct a convert LM with the same size as the o-
riginal one. The main difference between our pro-
posed method in this paper and our previous ap-
proach is that n-grams outside the corpus are gen-
erated firstly and the probabilities using CSLM are
calculated by using the same method as our previ-
ous approach. That is, the proposed new method
is the same as our previous one when no grown
n-grams are generated.

The method developed by Arsoy and colleagues
(Arsoy et al., 2013; Arsoy et al., 2014) adds al-
l the words in the short-list after the tail word of
the i-grams to construct the (i+1)-grams. For ex-
ample, if the i-gram is “I want”, then the (i+1)-
grams will be “I want *”, where “*” stands for any
word in the short list. Then the probabilities of
the (i+1)-grams are calculated using (i+1)-CSLM.
So a very large intermediate (i+1)-grams will have
to be grown1, and then be pruned into smaller
suitable size using an entropy-based LM pruning
method modified from (Stolcke, 1998). The (i+2)-
grams are grown using (i+1)-grams, recursively.

1In practice, the probabilities of all the target/tail words
in the short list for the history i-grams can be calculated by
the neurons in the output layer at the same time, which will
save some time. According to our experiments, the time cost
for Arsoy’s growing method is around 4 times more than our
proposed method, if the LMs which are 10 times larger than
the original one are grown with other settings all the same.

3 Bilingual LM Growing

The translation output of a phrase-based SMT sys-
tem can be regarded as a concatenation of phrases
in the phrase table (except unknown words). This
leads to the following procedure:

Step 1. All the n-grams included in the phrase
table should be maintained at first.

Step 2. The connecting phrases are defined in
the following way.

The wba is a target language phrase starting from
the a-th word ending with the b-th word, and βwbaγ
is a phrase including wba as a part of it, where β and
γ represent any word sequence or none. An i-gram
phrase wk1w

i
k+1 (1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1) is a connecting

phrase2, if :
(1) wk1 is the right (rear) part of one phrase βw

k
1

in the phrase table, or
(2) wik+1 is the left (front) part of one phrase

wik+1γ in the phrase table.
After the probabilities are calculated using C-

SLM (Eqs.1 and 2), we combine the n-grams in
the phrase table from Step 1 and the connecting
phrases from Step 2.

3.1 Ranking the Connecting Phrases

Since the size of connecting phrases is too huge
(usually more than one Terabyte), it is necessary
to decide the usefulness of connecting phrases for
SMT. The more useful connecting phrases can be
selected, by ranking the appearing probabilities of
the connecting phrases in SMT decoding.

Each line of a phrase table can be simplified
(without considering other unrelated scores in the
phrase table) as

f ||| e ||| P (e|f), (3)

where the P (e|f) means the translation probabili-
ty from f(source phrase) to e(target phrase),
which can be calculated using bilingual parallel
training data. In decoding, the probability of a tar-
get phrase e appearing in SMT should be

Pt(e) =
∑

f

Ps(f)× P (e|f), (4)

2We are aware that connecting phrases can be applied to
not only two phrases, but also three or more. However the ap-
pearing probabilities (which will be discussed in Eq. 5 of next
subsection) of connecting phrases are approximately estimat-
ed. To estimate and compare probabilities of longer phrases
in different lengths will lead to serious bias, and the experi-
ments also showed using more than two connecting phrases
did not perform well (not shown for limited space), so only
two connecting phrases are applied in this paper.

where the Ps(f) means the appearing probability
of a source phrase, which can be calculated using
source language part in the bilingual training data.

Using Pt(e)3, we can select the connecting
phrases e with high appearing probabilities as
the n-grams to be added to the original n-
grams. These n-grams are called ‘grown n-
grams’. Namely, we build all the connecting
phrases at first, and then we use the appearing
probabilities of the connecting phrases to decide
which connecting phrases should be selected. For
an i-gram connecting phrase wk1w

i
k+1, where w

k
1 is

part of βwk1 and w
i
k+1 is part of w

i
k+1γ (the βw

k
1

and wik+1γ are from the phrase table), the prob-
ability of the connecting phrases can be roughly
estimated as

Pcon(w
k
1w

i
k+1) =

i−1∑
k=1

(
∑

β

Pt(βw
k
1 )×∑

γ

Pt(w
i
k+1γ)).

(5)

A threshold for Pcon(wk1w
i
k+1) is set, and only

the connecting phrases whose appearing probabil-
ities are higher than the threshold will be selected
as the grown n-grams.

3.2 Calculating the Probabilities of Grown
N -grams Using CSLM

To our bilingual LM growing method, a 5-gram
LM and n-gram (n=2,3,4,5) CSLMs are built by
using the target language of the parallel corpus,
and the phrase table is learned from the parallel
corpus.

The probabilities of unigram in the original n-
gram LM will be maintained as they are. The
n-grams from the bilingual phrase table will be
grown by using the ‘connecting phrases’ method.
As the whole connecting phrases are too huge, we
use the ranking method to select the more useful
connecting phrases. The distribution of different
n-grams (n=2,3,4,5) of the grown LMs are set as
the same as the original LM.

The probabilities of the grown n-grams
(n=2,3,4,5) are calculated using the 2,3,4,5-
CSLM, respectively. If the tail (target) words of
the grown n-grams are not in the short-list of C-
SLM, the Pb(·) in Eq. 1 will be applied to calcu-
late their probabilities.

3This Pt(e) hence provides more bilingual information,
in comparison with using monolingual target LMs only.

191



We combine the n-grams (n=1,2,3,4,5) togeth-
er and re-normalize the probabilities and backof-
f weights of the grown LM. Finally the original
BNLM and the grown LM are interpolated. The
entire process is illustrated in Figure 1.

4 Experiments and Results

4.1 Experiment Setting up
The same setting up of the NTCIR-9 Chinese to
English translation baseline system (Goto et al.,
2011) was followed, only with various LMs to
compare them. The Moses phrase-based SMT
system was applied (Koehn et al., 2007), togeth-
er with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for align-
ment and MERT (Och, 2003) for tuning on the de-
velopment data. Fourteen standard SMT features
were used: five translation model scores, one word
penalty score, seven distortion scores, and one LM
score. The translation performance was measured
by the case-insensitive BLEU on the tokenized test
data.

We used the patent data for the Chinese to En-
glish patent translation subtask from the NTCIR-9
patent translation task (Goto et al., 2011). The par-
allel training, development, and test data sets con-
sist of 1 million (M), 2,000, and 2,000 sentences,
respectively.

Using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002; Stolcke et al.,
2011), we trained a 5-gram LM with the interpo-
lated Kneser-Ney smoothing method using the 1M
English training sentences containing 42M words
without cutoff. The 2,3,4,5-CSLMs were trained
on the same 1M training sentences using CSLM
toolkit (Schwenk, 2007; Schwenk, 2010). The set-
tings for CSLMs were: input layer of the same
dimension as vocabulary size (456K), projection
layer of dimension 256 for each word, hidden lay-
er of dimension 384 and output layer (short-list) of
dimension 8192, which were recommended in the
CSLM toolkit and (Wang et al., 2013a)4.

4Arsoy used around 55 M words as the corpus, including

4.2 Results

The experiment results were divided into four
groups: the original BNLMs (BN), the CSLM
Re-ranking (RE), our previous converting (WA),
the Arsoy’s growing, and our growing methods.
For our bilingual LM growing method, 5 bilingual
grown LMs (BI-1 to 5) were conducted in increas-
ing sizes. For the method of Arsoy, 5 grown LMs
(AR-1 to 5) with similar size of BI-1 to 5 were also
conducted, respectively.

For the CSLM re-ranking, we used CSLM to
re-rank the 100-best lists of SMT. Our previous
converted LM, Arsoy’s grown LMs and bilingual
grown LMs were interpolated with the original
BNLMs, using default setting of SRILM5. To re-
duce the randomness of MERT, we used two meth-
ods for tuning the weights of different SMT fea-
tures, and two BLEU scores are corresponding to
these two methods. The BLEU-s indicated that the
same weights of the BNLM (BN) features were
used for all the SMT systems. The BLEU-i indi-
cated that the MERT was run independently by
three times and the average BLEU scores were
taken.

We also performed the paired bootstrap re-
sampling test (Koehn, 2004)6. Two thousands
samples were sampled for each significance test.
The marks at the right of the BLEU score indicated
whether the LMs were significantly better/worse
than the Arsoy’s grown LMs with the same IDs
for SMT (“++/−−”: significantly better/worse at
α = 0.01, “+/−”: α = 0.05, no mark: not signif-
icantly better/worse at α = 0.05).

From the results shown in Table 1, we can get
the following observations:

(1) Nearly all the bilingual grown LMs outper-
formed both BNLM and our previous converted
LM on PPL and BLEU. As the size of grown LM-
s is increased, the PPL always decreased and the
BLEU scores trended to increase. These indicated
that our proposed method can give better probabil-
ity estimation for LM and better performance for
SMT.

(2) In comparison with the grown LMs in Ar-

84K words as vocabulary, and 20K words as short-list. In this
paper, we used the same setting as our previous work, which
covers 92.89% of the frequency of words in the training cor-
pus, for all the baselines and our method for fair comparison.

5In our previous work, we used the development data to
tune the weights of interpolation. In this paper, we used the
default 0.5 as the interpolation weights for fair comparison.

6We used the code available at http://www.ark.cs.
cmu.edu/MT

soy’s method, our grown LMs obtained better P-
PL and significantly better BLEU with the sim-
ilar size. Furthermore, the improvement of PPL
and BLEU of the existing methods became satu-
rated much more quickly than ours did, as the LMs
grew.

the n-grams Hit (ALH) in SMT decoding for dif-
ferent LMs using the following function

ALH =

where the Pi−gram means the ratio of the i-grams
hit in SMT decoding. There were also positive
correlations between ALH, PPL and BLEUs. The
ALH of bilingual grown LM was longer than that
of the Arsoy’s grown LM of the similar size. In
another word, less back-off was used for our pro-
posed grown LMs in SMT decoding.

4.3 Experiments on TED Corpus

The TED corpus is in special domain as discussed
in the introduction, where large extra monolingual
corpora are hard to find. In this subsection, we
conducted the SMT experiments on TED corpora
using our proposed LM growing method, to eval-
uate whether our method was adaptable to some
special domains.

We mainly followed the baselines of the IWSLT
2014 evaluation campaign7, only with a few mod-
ifications such as the LM toolkits and n-gram or-
der for constructing LMs. The Chinese (CN) to
English (EN) language pair was chosen, using de-
v2010 as development data and test2010 as evalu-
ation data. The same LM growing method was ap-

7https://wit3.fbk.eu/

plied on TED corpora as on NTCIR corpora. The
results were shown in Table 2.

BI-2 49.7M 78.3 13.16
BI-3 73.4M 77.6 13.24

Table 2 indicated that our proposed LM grow-
ing method improved both PPL and BLEU in com-
parison with both BNLM and our previous CSLM
converting method, so it was suitable for domain
adaptation, which is one of focuses of the current
SMT research.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a neural network
based bilingual LM growing method by using the
bilingual parallel corpus only for SMT. The results
show that our proposed method can improve both
LM and SMT performance, and outperforms the
existing LM growing methods significantly with-
out extra corpus. The connecting phrase-based
method can also be applied to LM adaptation.
