Abstract

The availability of corpora annotated with negation information is essential to develop negation
processing systems in any language. However, there is a lack of these corpora even for languages
like English, and when there are corpora available they are small and the annotations are not
always compatible across corpora. In this paper we review the existing corpora annotated with
negation in Spanish with the purpose of first, gathering the information to make it available
for other researchers and, second, analyzing how compatible are the corpora and how has the
linguistic phenomenon of negation been addressed. Our final aim is to develop a supervised
negation processing system for Spanish, for which we need training and test data. Our analysis
shows that it will not be possible to merge the small corpora existing for Spanish due to lack of
compatibility in the annotations.

Title and Abstract in Spanish

Revisión de los corpus españoles anotados con negación

La disponibilidad de corpus anotados con información sobre la negación es esencial para
cualquier idioma, ya que son necesarios para poder desarrollar sistemas capaces de procesar este
fenómeno lingüı́stico. Sin embargo, hay una escasez de corpus anotados con negación, incluso
para idiomas como el inglés, y cuando hay corpus disponibles, en la mayorı́a de los casos son
pequeños y las anotaciones no siempre son compatibles entre ellos. En este trabajo revisamos los
corpus anotados con información sobre la negación en español con el propósito, en primer lugar,
de recopilar la información para que esté disponible para otros investigadores y, en segundo lu-
gar, de analizar la compatibilidad de los corpus y las estructuras de negación que se han anotado.
Nuestro objetivo final es desarrollar un sistema automático para el procesamiento de la negación
en español. Nuestro análisis muestra que no será posible unir los pequeños corpus existentes
actualmente en español debido a la falta de compatibilidad en las anotaciones.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, there is a vast amount of information on the Internet. The large number of sources and the
high volume of texts make it difficult for users to select information of interest. In order to extract fine-
grained information, automatic systems need to be able to process a diversity of linguistic phenomena
such as negation, irony or sarcasm that are used to add extra-propositional meaning. In this study, we
focus on negation.

Negation is a very relevant linguistic phenomenon for most of Natural Language Procesing (NLP)
tasks, such as information extraction, question answering and sentiment analysis, since negation cues act
as operators that can change the meaning of the words that are within their scope by changing the truth
value of propositions (Horn, 1989). Negation is a main linguistic phenomenon whose computational

treatment has not been solved yet, not even for English, due to its complexity and the multiple forms in
which it can appear (syntactic, lexical and morphological). Because of the low frequency of negations as
compared to other phenomena, the impact in the performance of applications is low from a quantitative
perspective, but high from a qualitative view, for example, when processing clinical records. Moreover,
some systems we use regularly do not treat this phenomenon effectively. Not even Google deals properly
with negation in Spanish. The search “pelı́culas que no sean de aventuras”, returns adventure movies,
whereas it should return non adventure movies.

The standard two phases of a negation processing system are: identifying the presence of negation
markers and determining their scope. As in NLP tasks, the availability of corpora annotated with infor-
mation about negation is essential to train algorithms. However, it is not easy to find corpora annotated
with negation, especially in languages other than English. In addition, it is not only necessary that cor-
pora exist, but also that corpora are publicly available for the community to use them, that they are well
documented, and that they contain annotations of quality. Ideally, they should also be large enough to
allow training robust machine learning systems.

There are different catalogs and platforms that provide information about resources and/or access to
them, such as LDC catalog1, ELRA catalog2, LRE Map3, META-SHARE4 and ReTeLe5 catalog. If we
make a query6 in these repositories for Spanish corpora annotated with negation, we only find 1 resource
in ReTeLe catalog, the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus (Jiménez-Zafra et al., 2018). Therefore, we decided
to perform an exhaustive search of resources. In this way, we facilitate the task for researchers interested
in working on this topic by providing a description of the corpora as well as the direct links to get the
data when possible.

In this work, we review the existing Spanish corpora annotated with negation. We focus on Spanish
because i) there are no negation processing systems available, ii) it is the second language with most
native speakers, and iii) it is the third language most used on the Internet. Our final goal is to develop a
supervised negation processing system, for which we need to use annotated corpora. The main purposes
of our review are to analyze how compatible are the Spanish corpora annotated with negation and to find
out whether the annotations account for the complexity of negation in Spanish.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the main features of negation
in Spanish, in Section 3 we present the corpora annotated with negation, in Section 4 we analyzed them,
in Section 5 we propose a solution to the problems found and, finally, we put forward conclusions in
Section 6.

2 Negation in Spanish

Processing negation is not as easy as using a list of negation markers and applying look-up methods.
They can be used to find out potential negation cues but they are not adequate because the presence of a
cue does not imply that it acts as a negation. In the sentence “You bought the car to use it, didn’t you?”
the cue “not” is not used as a negation but it is used to reinforce the first part of the sentence. Moreover,
it is also necessary to identify the scope or part of the sentence affected by the negation and its focus,
the part more prominently negated. If we want to advance in the study of this phenomenon, as for most
of NLP tasks, the availability of annotated corpora is essential to train algorithms. According to existing
resources for English, annotating negation involves the annotation of the following aspects:

• Negation cue: lexical item(s) that modify the truth value of the propositions that are within its scope.
There are different types of negation according to the type of the negation cue used:

– Syntactic negation, if a syntactically independent negation marker is used to express negation
(i.e. no [‘no/not’], nunca [‘never’]).

– Lexical negation, if a word is used whose meaning has a negative component (i.e. negar
[‘deny’], desistir [‘desist’]).

– Morphological negation, if a morpheme is used to express the negation (i.e. i- in ilegal [‘ille-
gal’], in in incoherente [‘incoherent’]). It is also known as affixal negation.

• Scope: the part of the sentence affected by the negation cue (Vincze et al., 2008). The scope can be
continuous or discontinuous.

• Focus: the part of the scope that is most prominently or explicitly negated (Blanco and Moldovan,
2011).

• Negated event: the event that is directly negated by the negation cue, usually a verb, a noun or an
adjective (Kim et al., 2008).

This is just a list of the main aspects that have been annotated for negation. However, each language
has specific linguistic resources to express negation and specific negation structures, which should also
be reflected in the information annotated in corpora. As we will show in Section 4, most existing anno-
tation schemes for Spanish do not account for the complexity of the linguistic structures used to express
negation that are present in texts. This happens mainly because of two reasons: first, annotation of
negation started with the annotation of clinical reports in English (Chapman et al., 2001; Goldin and
Chapman, 2003; Mutalik et al., 2001a), where there is not too much variation of negation structures.
Second, corpora have been created for specific purposes, such as extracting negated clinical events, and
not with the intention of accounting for all the linguistic complexity of the negation phenomenon.

An exception to this is the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus (Jiménez-Zafra et al., 2018; Martı́ et al., 2016).
The guidelines specify a great variety of negation patterns at the syntactic level that we summarize
below. Additionally, the guidelines also specify expressions that involve a negation cue but do not express
negation.

On the one hand, patterns that express negation can be divided into three categories:

1. Simple negation markers, if they are composed of only one single negation marker (i.e. no
[‘no/not’], nunca [‘never’]).

2. Complex negation markers, if negation is expressed using two or more negation markers that can
be continuous (i.e. casi no [‘almost not’], casi nunca [‘hardly ever’]) or discontinuous (i.e. no ...
en absoluto [‘not ... at all’], no ... mucho [‘not ... a lot’]). Complex negation markers are usually
used to reinforce negation or to modulate the value of negation (increase or diminish the degree of
negation).

3. Expressions that do not contain any negation marker: lexicalized complex constructions that ex-
press negation in specific contexts even though they do not contain any negation marker (i.e. en mi
vida [‘in my life’]).

On the other hand, patterns that not express negation can be categorized as follows:

1. Rhetorical negation markers, if a negation marker is used with an emphatic or expletive value, that
is, if it is used to make a sentence more full, intense or harmonious, although it is not necessary to
understand the meaning of the sentence (i.e. Viniste a verlo, ¿no? [‘You came to see him, didn’t
you?’]).

2. Idioms containing negation markers, if an idiom (i.e. ni corta ni perezosa [‘without thinking twice’])
or a lexicalised cue (i.e. hasta que no [‘until’]) contain a negation marker that does not express
negation.



918

3. Negation markers in contrastive constructions, if negation markers are used to counterpose different
ideas, to correct something, to introduce new information or to express obligation, rather than to
express negation (i.e. No hay más solución que comprar una lavadora [‘There is no other solution
than to buy a washing machine’]).

4. Negation markers in comparative constructions, if negation markers are used to compare some
property with something, that is, negation is used to place an entity below or above another entity
on a scale (i.e. No es tan grande como me lo imaginaba [‘It is not as big as I imagined’]).

3 Corpora annotated with negation

In this section, the Spanish corpora annotated with negation are presented7. To the best of our knowledge,
five corpora exist from different domains, although the clinical domain is the predominant one.

3.1 UAM Spanish Treebank
The first Spanish corpus annotated with negation that we are aware of is the UAM Spanish Treebank
(Moreno et al., 2003), which was enriched with the annotation of negation cues and their scopes (San-
doval and Salazar, 2013).

The initial UAM Spanish Treebank consisted of 1,500 sentences extracted from newspaper articles (El
Paı́s Digital and Compra Maestra) that were annotated syntactically. Trees were encoded in a nested
structure, including syntactic category, syntactic and semantic features, and constituent nodes, following
the Penn Treebank model. Later, this version of the corpus was extended with the annotation of negation
and 10.67% of the sentences were found to contain negations (160 sentences).

In this corpus, syntactic negation was annotated but not lexical nor morphological negation. It was
annotated by two experts in corpus linguistics who followed similar guidelines to those of Bioscope
corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008; Vincze, 2010). They included negation cues within the scope as in Bioscope
and NegDDI-DrugBank (Bokharaeian et al., 2014). All the arguments of the negated events were also
included in the scope of negation, including the subject, which was excluded from the scope in active
sentences in Bioscope. There is no information about inter-annotator agreement.

The UAM Spanish Treebank corpus is freely available at http://www.lllf.uam.es/ESP/
Treebank.html. It is in XML format, negation cues are tagged with the label Type=“NEG” and
the scope of negation is tagged with the label Neg=“YES” in the syntactic constituent on which negation
acts.

3.2 IxaMed-GS
The IxaMed-GS corpus (Oronoz et al., 2015) is composed of 75 real electronic health records from
the outpatient consultations of the Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital in Biscay (Spain). It was annotated by
two experts in pharmacology and pharmacovigilance with entities related to diseases and drugs, and
with the relationships between entities indicating adverse drug reaction events. They defined their own
annotation guidelines taken into consideration the issues that should be considered for the design of a
corpus according to Ananiadou and McNaught (2006).

The objective of this corpus was not the annotation of negation but the identification of entities and
events in clinical reports. However, negation and speculation were taken into account in the annotation
process. In the corpus, four entity types were annotated: diseases, allergies, drugs and procedures. For
diseases and allergies, they distinguished between negated entity, speculated entity and entity (for non-
speculative and non-negated entities). 2,362 diseases were annotated, out of which 490 (20.75%) were
tagged as negated diseases and 40 (1.69%) as speculated diseases. 404 allergy entities were identified,
of which 273 (67.57%) were negated and 13 (3.22%), speculated. The quality of the annotation process
was assessed by measuring the inter-annotator agreement, which was 90.53% for entities and 82.86% for
events.

The corpus might be acquired via the EXTRECM project8 by agreeing to some conditions that include
a confidentiality agreement.

3.3 SFU ReviewSP-NEG
The SFU ReviewSP-NEG9 (Jiménez-Zafra et al., 2018) is the first Spanish corpus that includes the event
in the annotation of negation and that takes into account discontinuous negation markers. Moreover, it is
the first corpus where the effect of the negation on the words that are within its scope is annotated, that
is, whether there is a change in the polarity or an increment or reduction of its value. It is an extension
of the Spanish part of the SFU Review corpus (Taboada et al., 2006) and it could be considered as the
counterpart of the SFU Review Corpus with negation and speculation annotations10 (Konstantinova et
al., 2012).

The Spanish SFU Review corpus consists of 400 reviews extracted from the website Ciao.es that
belong to 8 different domains: cars, hotels, washing machines, books, cell phones, music, computers,
and movies. For each domain there are 50 positive and 50 negative reviews, defined as positive or
negative based on the number of stars given by the reviewer (1-2=negative; 4-5=positive; 3-star review
were not included). Later, it was extended to the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus in which each review was
automatically annotated at the token level with POS-tags and lemmas, and manually annotated at the
sentence level with negation cues and their corresponding scopes and events. It is composed of 9,455
sentences, out of which 3,022 sentences (31.97%) contain at least one negation marker.

In this corpus, syntactic negation was annotated but not lexical nor morphological negation, as in
the UAM Spanish Treebank corpus. Unlike this one, annotations on the event and on how negation
affects the polarity of the words within its scope were included. The annotations were performed by two
senior researchers with in-depth experience in corpus annotation who supervised the whole process and
two trained annotators who carried out the annotation task. The Kappa coefficient for inter-annotator
agreement was of 0.97 for negation cues, 0.95 for negated events and 0.94 for scopes.11 A detailed
discussion of the main sources of disagreements can be found in (Jiménez-Zafra et al., 2016).

The guidelines of the Bioscope corpus were taken into account but after a thorough analysis of negation
in Spanish, a typology of Spanish negation patterns was defined (Martı́ et al., 2016). As in Bioscope,
NegDDI-DrugBank and UAM Spanish Treebank, negation markers were included within the scope.
Moreover, the subject was also included within the scope when the word directly affected by negation is
the verb of the sentence, as in ConanDoyle-neg corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2012). The event was
also included in the scope of negation as in ConanDoyle-neg corpus.

The SFU ReviewSP-NEG is publicly available and can be downloaded at http://sinai.ujaen.
es/sfu-review-sp-neg-2/.

3.4 UHU-HUVR
The UHU-HUVR (Cruz Dı́az et al., 2017) is the first Spanish corpus in which affixal negation is anno-
tated. It is composed of 604 clinical reports from the Virgen del Rocı́o Hospital in Seville (Spain). 276
of this clinical documents correspond to radiology reports and 328 to the personal history of anamnesis
reports written in free text.

In this corpus, all types of negation were annotated, syntactic, morphological (affixal negation), and
lexical. It was annotated with negation markers and the negated events by two domain expert annotators
following closely the Thyme corpus guidelines (Styler IV et al., 2014) with some adaptations. In the
anamnesis reports, 1,079 sentences (35.20%) were found to contain negations out of 3,065 sentences.
On the other hand, 1,219 sentences (22.80%) out of 5,347 sentences were annotated with negations
in the radiology reports. The Dice coefficient for inter-annotator agreement was higher than 0.94 for
negation markers and higher than 0.72 for negated events. Most of the disagreements were the result of
a human error, i.e., the annotators missed a word or included a word that did not belong either to the
event or to the marker. However, other cases of disagreement can be explained by the difficulty of the
task and the lack of clear guidance. They encountered the same type of disagreements as Jiménez-Zafra
et al. (2016) when annotating the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus.

due to the detection of an error in the calculation thereof.



920

Authors say that the annotated corpus will be made publicly available, but it is not currently available
probably because of legal and ethical issues.

3.5 IULA Spanish Clinical Record

The IULA Spanish Clinical Record corpus (Marimon et al., 2017) contains 300 anonymized clinical
records from several services of one of the main hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) that was annotated with
negation markers and their scopes. It contains 3,194 sentences, out of which 1,093 (34.22%) were
annotated with negation cues.

In this corpus, syntactic negation and lexical negation were annotated but not morphological negation.
It was annotated with negation cues and their scopes by three computational linguists annotators advised
by a clinician. The inter-annotator agreement Kappa rates were 0.85 between annotators 1 and 2, and
annotators 1 and 3; and 0.88 between annotators 2 and 3. The authors defined their own annotation
guidelines taking into account the currently existing guidelines for corpora in English (Mutalik et al.,
2001b; Szarvas et al., 2008; Morante and Daelemans, 2012). Differently from previous work, they did
not include the negation cue nor the subject in the scope (except when the subject is located after the
verb).

The corpus is publicly available with a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license and it can be downloaded at http:
//eines.iula.upf.edu/brat//#/NegationOnCR_IULA/.

4 Analysis

In order to take an informed decision about which (combination of) corpus can we use to develop a
system, we have performed a detailed analysis. An overview of the information annotated can be found
in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1 presents a summary of the negation aspects annotated in each corpus, the domain of the doc-
uments, the size in number of sentences and the inter-annotator measure used to estimate the agreement.
Table 2 contains the type of negation cues that have been annotated in each corpus and negation types
that have been taken into account.

The years of publication of the corpora show the novelty of the task. The first corpus annotated with
negation in Spanish appeared in 2013, while the others have been compiled in the last two years. Im-
portant aspects of the corpora to be analyzed are the type of documents included, the size, the guidelines
applied, the annotation schemes and the inter-annotator agreement.

Three of the five corpora focus on the clinical domain, which reflects the demands for the treatment
of negation in this domain. Processing negation in clinical documents is crucial because the health of
a patient is at stake, it is not the same to say that a patient has or does not have a disease or that he is
or is not allergic to a compound. Moreover, we observe that there are other domains of interest, such
as product reviews and news. The rating of a film will be totally different if a viewer says “I liked the

movie” or if he says “I did not like the movie”. In the case of news, the impact would be totally different
if it is said “A plane crashed” or if it is said “Finally the plane did not crash”.

As for the size, the available corpora are not very large and, although negation is an important phe-
nomenon for NLP tasks, it is relatively unfrequent. In newspaper articles, only 10.73% of the sentences
contain negation and, in the case of product reviews and clinical reports this value amounts to 31.97%
and 29.22%12, respectively. These percentages show the need of continuing working on the annotation
of negation and its study. Training supervised systems usually relies on the existence of annotated cor-
pora and, consequently, corpus generation is an important part for the development and testing of NLP
techniques.

In relation to the guidelines used, it is noteworthy that there is no uniformity. In the first place, there
are divergences in the negation aspects being annotated (negation cue, scope, event, focus). None of the
corpora contain annotations of the four elements and the focus has been annotated in none of them. Only
the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus contains annotations of three elements (negation cue, scope and event).
The UAM Spanish Treebank and the IULA Spanish Clinical Record corpora have focused on annotating
negation cues and their scopes, and the UHU-UVR on the annotation of negation cues and their events.
In the second place, these elements have not been annotated in the same way:

• Negation cue. As it has been described in Section 2, negation in Spanish is a complex phenomenon.
Depending on the negation cue used, it can be syntactic, lexical or morphological. Moreover there
are different types of negation patterns that express negation (simple negation markers, complex
negation markers and expressions not containing any negation marker) and that do not express
negation (rhetorical negation markers, idioms containing negation markers, negation markers in
contrastive constructions and negation markers in comparative constructions). Only the UHU-UVR
corpus contains annotations about the three types of negation cues (syntactic, lexical and morpho-
logical). The UAM Spanish Treebank and the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpora take only into account
syntactic negation, and the IULA Spanish Clinical Record corpus also considered it along with lex-
ical negation. However, in general, it is not specified whether the complexity of negation has been
taken into account during the annotation process. An exception to this is the SFU ReviewSP-NEG
corpus. The guidelines specify that the different types of negation patterns according to the seman-
tic interpretation have been considered for the annotation of negation at the syntactic level. This

12For clinical reports, it has been considered the average corresponding to the sentences annotated in UHU-HUVR and IULA
Spanish Clinical Record corpora.



922

information has been summarized in Table 2.

• Scope. In the UAM Spanish Treebank and the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpora negation cues were
included within the scope of negation as in Bioscope (Vincze et al., 2008), but in the IULA Spanish
Clinical Record corpus they were not included. On the other hand, in the UAM Spanish Treebank all
the arguments of the negated events, including the subject, were included within the scope of nega-
tion. However, in the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpora, the subject was included within the scope of
negation when the word directly affected by negation is the verb of the sentence, as in ConanDoyle-
neg corpus (Morante and Daelemans, 2012). In the IULA Spanish Clinical Record corpus it was
not included, except when the subject is located after the verb.

• Focus. This element has not been annotated in the existing corpora.

• Negated event. In the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus the event is always included within the scope
of negation, as in Conan Doyle-neg corpus, and it is usually the head of the phrase in which the
negation appears. In the UHU-UVR corpus negated events are annotated if they are clinically
relevant, so not all negated events are annotated.

As for the annotation schemes, there is no a standard one. Each project devices the own scheme
according to the needs of the project, which has consequences in the compatibility of the annotations
across corpora. It is not possible to combine the corpora for machine learning purposes in order to obtain
more training data.

Furthermore, the annotated corpora do not use the same coefficient to measure the inter-annotator
agreement and there is even a corpus for which this measure is not provided. Providing this measure is
very important because it allows to show the reliability of the annotation and the difficulty of the task.

The main purposes of our review was to analyse how compatible are the Spanish corpora annotated
with negation and to find out whether the annotations account for the complexity of negation in Spanish.
We have found that the existing corpora are not compatible, they have not been annotated with the same
purpose and they do not contain annotations for the same negation aspects. Even in those corpora that
contain annotations for the same negation aspect, the annotations have been made based on different
guidelines. In relation to the complexity of negation, only the SFU ReviewSP -NEG guidelines specify
how different negation structures should be annotated. The guidelines of the other corpora do not contain
information about the linguistic structures that have been taken into account.

5 A solution

The result of this analysis opens some questions. The existing annotation schemes are not compatible
because of differences in genre, annotation guidelines, and the aspects of negation that have been anno-
tated (negation cue, scope, event, focus). Therefore, it would be desirable to define a new scheme that
integrates the contents of existing schemes. The scheme should be domain independent and all negation
elements should be annotated in the same way. We are currently working on this. We have proposed a
workshop (NEGES - Workshop on Negation in Spanish13) to advance in the study of this phenomenon
and one of the tasks14 has as goal to reach an agreement on the guidelines to follow. In order to partici-
pate in the task, researchers must analyze the existing guidelines and send a document indicating which
aspects of the guidelines they agree with and which they do not, all duly justified. This information will
be used to discuss the aspects of interest and to try to reach a consensus.

Additionally, we will conduct a study on the feasibility of an automatic conversion of the corpora. It
is a pity that after all the work done and the time invested in the annotation of these corpora, it is not
possible to merge them. We will explore semi-automatic approaches to re-annotate the most corpora
possible.

6 Conclusions

Processing negation is a very important task in NLP because negation can change the truth value of a
proposition. Detecting this is crucial in some tasks such as sentiment analysis or question answering.
Most existing work on the treatment of negation has been carried out for English, but it is necessary to
focus on other languages such as Chinese, Spanish or Arabic.

In this paper, we have presented the existing Spanish corpora annotated with negation information and
we have described the main features of each one. Three of them are centered on the clinical domain
probably because it is one of the areas where the treatment of negation is crucial in order not to extract
false information about clinical conditions. It is worth noting that the first corpus annotated with negation
appeared in 2013, whereas the rest have been compiled in the last two years, which shows the novelty of
the task.

Our analysis shows that it would not be possible to merge the existing corpora in order to obtain a
bigger one to train a machine learning system because of differences in genre, annotation guidelines,
and the aspects of negation that have been annotated. The corpora have not been annotated with the
same purpose and they do not contain annotations for the same negation aspects. Despite the fact that
there have been already several annotation efforts, the community lacks a standard to annotate negation,
contrary to what happens with other phenomena such as semantic roles.

As future work we plan to develop annotation standards to annotate negation in Spanish, in such a way
that they are applicable to different genres and domains, and to analyze the feasibility of an automatic
