Abstract

While the automatic translation of tweets has
already been investigated in different scenar-
ios, we are not aware of any attempt to trans-
late tweets created by government agencies.
In this study, we report the experimental re-
sults we obtained when translating 12 Twitter
feeds published by agencies and organizations
of the government of Canada, using a state-of-
the art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
engine as a black box translation device. We
mine parallel web pages linked from the URLs
contained in English-French pairs of tweets in
order to create tuning and training material.
For a Twitter feed that would have been other-
wise difficult to translate, we report significant
gains in translation quality using this strategy.
Furthermore, we give a detailed account of the
problems we still face, such as hashtag trans-
lation as well as the generation of tweets of
legal length.

1 Introduction

Twitter is currently one of the most popular online
social networking service after Facebook, and is the
fastest-growing, with the half-a-billion user mark
reached in June 2012.1 According to Twitter’s blog,
no less than 65 millions of tweets are published each
day, mostly in a single language (40% in English).
This hinders the spread of information, a situation
witnessed for instance during the Arab Spring.

Solutions for disseminating tweets in different
languages have been designed. One solution con-
sists in manually translating tweets, which of course
is only viable for a very specific subset of the ma-
terial appearing on Twitter. For instance, the non-
profit organization Meedan2 has been founded in or-
der to organize volunteers willing to translate tweets
written in Arabic on Middle East issues. Another
solution consists in using machine translation. Sev-
eral portals are facilitating this,3 mainly by using
Google’s machine translation API.

Curiously enough, few studies have focused on
the automatic translation of text produced within so-
cial networks, even though a growing number of
these studies concentrate on the automated process-
ing of messages exchanged on social networks. See
(Gimpel et al., 2011) for a recent review of some of
them.

Some effort has been invested in translating short
text messages (SMSs). Notably, Munro (2010) de-
scribes the service deployed by a consortium of vol-
unteer organizations named “Mission 4636” during
the earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010.
This service routed SMSs alerts reporting trapped
people and other emergencies to a set of volunteers
who translated Haitian Creole SMSs into English,
so that primary emergency responders could under-
stand them. In Lewis (2010), the authors describe
how the Microsoft translation team developed a sta-
tistical translation engine (Haitian Creole into En-
glish) in as little as 5 days, during the same tragedy.

Jehl (2010) addresses the task of translating En-
glish tweets into German. She concludes that the
proper treatment of unknown words is of the utmost
importance and highlights the problem of producing
translations of up to 140 characters, the upper limit
on tweet lengths. In (Jehl et al., 2012), the authors
describe their efforts to collect bilingual tweets from
a stream of tweets acquired programmatically, and
show the impact of such a collection on developing
an Arabic-to-English translation system.

The present study participates in the effort for the
dissemination of messages exchanged over Twitter
in different languages, but with a very narrow focus,
which we believe has not been addressed specifically
yet: Translating tweets written by government in-
stitutions. What sets these messages apart is that,
generally speaking, they are written in a proper lan-
guage (without which their credibility would pre-
sumably be hurt), while still having to be extremely
brief to abide by the ever-present limit of 140 char-
acters. This contrasts with typical social media texts
in which a large variability in quality is observed
(Agichtein et al., 2008).

Tweets from government institutions can also dif-
fer somewhat from some other, more informal so-
cial media texts in their intended audience and ob-
jectives. Specifically, such tweet feeds often attempt
to serve as a credible source of timely information
presented in a way that engages members of the
lay public. As such, translations should present a
similar degree of credibility, ease of understanding,
and ability to engage the audience as in the source
tweet—all while conforming to the 140 character
limits.

This study attempts to take these matters into ac-
count for the task of translating Twitter feeds emitted
by Canadian governmental institutions. This could
prove very useful, since more than 150 Canadian
agencies have official feeds. Moreover, while only
counting 34 million inhabitants, Canada ranks fifth
in the number of Twitter users (3% of all users) after
the US, the UK, Australia, and Brazil.4 This cer-
tainly explains why Canadian governments, politi-
cians and institutions are making an increasing use
of this social network service. Given the need of

4http://www.techvibes.com/blog/how-
canada-stacks-up-against-the-world-on-
twitter-2012-10-17

Canadian governmental institutions to disseminate
information in both official languages (French and
English), we see a great potential value in targeted
computer-aided translation tools, which could offer
a significant reduction over the current time and ef-
fort required to manually translate tweets.

We show that a state-of-the-art SMT toolkit, used
off-the-shelf, and trained on out-domain data is un-
surprisingly not up to the task. We report in Sec-
tion 2 our efforts in mining bilingual material from
the Internet, which proves eventually useful in sig-
nificantly improving the performance of the engine.
We test the impact of simple adaptation scenarios
in Section 3 and show the significant improvements
in BLEU scores obtained thanks to the corpora we
mined. In Section 4, we provide a detailed account
of the problems that remain to be solved, including
the translation of hashtags (#-words) omnipresent
in tweets and the generation of translations of legal
lengths. We conclude this work-in-progress and dis-
cuss further research avenues in Section 5.

2.1 Bilingual Twitter Feeds

An exhaustive list of Twitter feeds published by
Canadian government agencies and organizations
can be found on the GOV.PoliTWiTTER.ca web
site.5 As of this writing, 152 tweet feeds are listed,
most of which are available in both French and En-
glish, in keeping with the Official Languages Act
of Canada. We manually selected 20 of these feed
pairs, using various exploratory criteria, such as
their respective government agency, the topics being
addressed and, importantly, the perceived degree of
parallelism between the corresponding French and
English feeds.

All the tweets of these 20 feed pairs were gathered
using Twitter’s Streaming API on 26 March 2013.
We filtered out the tweets that were marked by the
API as retweets and replies, because they rarely have
an official translation. Each pair of filtered feeds
was then aligned at the tweet level in order to cre-
ate bilingual tweet pairs. This step was facilitated
by the fact that timestamps are assigned to each
tweet. Since a tweet and its translation are typi-

cally issued at about the same time, we were able to
align the tweets using a dynamic programming al-
gorithm miminizing the total time drift between the
English and the French feeds. Finally, we tokenized
the tweets using an adapted version of Twokenize
(O’Connor et al., 2010), accounting for the hashtags,
usernames and urls contained in tweets.

We eventually had to narrow down further the
number of feed pairs of interest to the 12 most pro-
lific ones. For instance, the feed pair PassportCan6

that we initially considered contained only 54 pairs
of English-French tweets after filtering and align-
ment, and was discarded because too scarce.

The main characteristics of the 12 feed pairs we
ultimately retained are reported in Table 1, for a to-
tal of 8758 tweet pairs. The largest feed, in terms
of the number of tweet pairs used, is that of Health
Canada7 with over 1 489 pairs of retained tweets
pairs at the time of acquisition. For reference, that
is 62% of the 2 395 “raw” tweets available on the
English feed, before filtering and alignment. An ex-
ample of a retained pair of tweets is shown in Fig-
ure 1. In this example, both tweets contain a short-
ened url alias that (when expanded) leads to web-
pages that are parallel. Both tweets also contain so-
called hashtags (#-words): 2 of those are correctly
translated when going from English to French, but
the hashtag #radon is not translated into a hashtag in
French, instead appearing as the plain word radon,
for unknown reasons.

2.2 Out-of-domain Corpora: Parliament
Debates

We made use of two different large corpora in or-
der to train our baseline SMT engines. We used the
2M sentence pairs of the Europarl version 7 corpus.8

This is a priori an out-of-domain corpus, and we did
not expect much of the SMT system trained on this
dataset. Still, it is one of the most popular parallel
corpus available to the community and serves as a
reference.

We also made use of 2M pairs of sentences we
extracted from an in-house version of the Canadian
Hansard corpus. This material is not completely out-
of-domain, since the matters addressed within the
Canadian Parliament debates likely coincide to some
degree with those tweeted by Canadian institutions.
The main characteristics of these two corpora are re-
ported in Table 2. It is noteworthy that while both

corpora contain an equal number of sentence pairs,
the average sentence length in the Europarl corpus is
much higher, leading to a much larger set of tokens.

2.3 In-domain Corpus: URL Corpus

As illustrated in Figure 1, many tweets act as
“teasers”, and link to web pages containing (much)
more information on the topic the tweet feed typi-
cally addresses. Therefore, a natural way of adapt-
ing a corpus-driven translation engine consists in
mining the parallel text available at those urls.

In our case, we set aside the last 200 tweet pairs of
each feed as a test corpus. The rest serves as the url-
mining corpus. This is necessary to avoid testing our
system on test tweets whose URLs have contributed
to the training corpus.

Although simple in principle, this data collection
operation consists in numerous steps, outlined be-
low:

1. Split each feed pair in two: The last 200 tweet
pairs are set aside for testing purposes, the rest
serves as the url-mining corpus used in the fol-
lowing steps.

2. Isolate urls in a given tweet pair using our to-
kenizer, adapted to handle Twitter text (includ-
ing urls).

3. Expand shortened urls. For instance, the url
in the English example of Figure 1 would
be expanded into http://www.hc-sc.
gc.ca/ewh-semt/radiation/radon/
testing-analyse-eng.php, using the
expansion service located at the domain t.co.
There are 330 such services on the Web.

4. Download the linked documents.

5. Extract all text from the web pages, without tar-
geting any content in particular (the site menus,
breadcrumb, and other elements are therefore
retained).

6. Segment the text into sentences, and tokenize
them into words.

7. Align sentences with our in-house aligner.

We implemented a number of restrictions during
this process. We did not try to match urls in cases
where the number of urls in each tweet differed (see
column mis.—mismatches—in Table 1). The col-
umn probs. (problems) in Table 1 shows the count of
url pairs whose content could not be extracted. This
happened when we encountered urls that we could
not expand, as well as those returning a 404 HTTP
error code. We also rejected urls that were identi-
cal in both tweets, because they obviously could not
be translations. We also filtered out documents that
were not in html format, and we removed document
pairs where at least one document was difficult to
convert into text (e.g. because of empty content, or
problematic character encoding). After inspection,
we also decided to discard sentences that counted
less than 10 words, because shorter sentences are
too often irrelevant website elements (menu items,
breadcrumbs, copyright notices, etc.).

This 4-hour long operation (including download)
yielded a number of useful web documents and ex-
tracted sentence pairs reported in Table 1 (columns
URLs and sents respectively). We observed that the
density of url pairs present in pairs of tweets varies
among feeds. Still, for all feeds, we were able to
gather a set of (presumably) parallel sentence pairs.

The validity of our extraction process rests on the
hypothesis that the documents mentioned in each
pair of urls are parallel. In order to verify this, we
manually evaluated (a posteriori) the parallelness of
a random sample of 50 sentence pairs extracted for
each feed. Quite fortunately, the extracted material
was of excellent quality, with most samples contain-
ing all perfectly aligned sentences. Only canadabusi-
ness, LibraryArchives and CanBorder counted a sin-
gle mistranslated pair. Clearly, the websites of the
Canadian institutions we mined are translated with
great care and the tweets referring to them are metic-
ulously translated in terms of content links.

3 Experiments

3.1 Methodology

All our translation experiments were conducted with
Moses’ EMS toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), which in
turn uses gizapp (Och and Ney, 2003) and SRILM
(Stolcke, 2002).

As a test bed, we used the 200 bilingual tweets
we acquired that were not used to follow urls, as de-
scribed in Sections 2.1 and 2.3. We kept each feed
separate in order to measure the performance of our
system on each of them. Therefore we have 12 test
sets.

We tested two configurations: one in which an
out-of-domain translation system is applied (with-
out adaptation) to the translation of the tweets of
our test material, another one where we allowed the
system to look at in-domain data, either at training
or at tuning time. The in-domain material we used
for adapting our systems is the URL corpus we de-
scribed in section 2.3. More precisely, we prepared
12 tuning corpora, one for each feed, each contain-
ing 800 heldout sentence pairs. The same number of
sentence pairs was considered for out-domain tuning
sets, in order not to bias the results in favor of larger
sets. For adaptation experiments conducted at train-
ing time, all the URL material extracted from a spe-
cific feed (except for the sentences of the tuning sets)
was used. The language model used in our experi-
ments was a 5-gram language model with Kneser-
Ney smoothing.

It must be emphasized that there is no tweet mate-
rial in our training or tuning sets. One reason for this
is that we did not have enough tweets to populate our
training corpus. Also, this corresponds to a realistic
scenario where we want to translate a Twitter feed
without first collecting tweets from this feed.

We use the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002)
as well as word-error rate (WER) to measure trans-
lation quality. A good translation system maximizes
BLEU and minimizes WER. Due to initially poor
results, we had to refine the tokenizer mentioned
in Section 2.1 in order to replace urls with serial-
ized placeholders, since those numerous entities typ-
ically require rule-based translations. The BLEU
and WER scores we report henceforth were com-
puted on such lowercased, tokenized and serialized
texts, and did not incur penalties that would have

(unknown tokens), for instance.

3.2 Translation Results

Table 3 reports the results observed for the two main
configurations we tested, in both translation direc-
tions. We show results only for two feeds here:
canadabusiness, for which we collected the largest
number of sentence pairs in the URL corpus, and
DFAIT MAECI for which we collected very little
material. For canadabusiness, the performance of the
system trained on Hansard data is higher than that
of the system trained on Europarl (∆ ranging from
2.19 to 5.28 points of BLEU depending on the con-
figuration considered). For DFAIT MAECI , supris-
ingly, Europarl gives a better result, but by a more
narrow margin (∆ ranging from 0.19 to 1.75 points
of BLEU). Both tweet feeds are translated with
comparable performance by SMT, both in terms
of BLEU and WER. When comparing BLEU per-
formances based solely on the tuning corpus used,
the in-domain tuning corpus created by mining urls
yields better results than the out-domain tuning cor-
pus seven times out of eight for the results shown in
Table 3.

The complete results are shown in Figure 2, show-
ing BLEU scores obtained for the 12 feeds we con-
sidered, when translating from English to French.

Figure 2: BLEU scores measured on the 12 feed pairs we considered for the English-to-French translation direction.
For each tweet test corpus, there are 4 results: a dark histogram bar refers to the Hansard training corpus, while a
lighter grey bar refers to an experiment where the training corpus was Europarl. The “in” category on the x-axis
designates an experiment where the tuning corpus was in-domain (URL corpus), while the “out” category refers to an
out-of-domain tuning set. The out-of-domain tuning corpus is Europarl or Hansard, and always matches the nature of
training corpora.

the system is hardly discernible, which in a sense
is good news, since tuning a system for each feed
is not practical. The Hansard corpus almost always
gives better results, in keeping with its status as a
corpus that is not so out-of-domain as Europarl, as
mentioned above. The results for the reverse trans-
lation direction show the same trends.

In order to try a different strategy than using only
tuning corpora to adapt the system, we also investi-
gated the impact of training the system on a mix of
out-of-domain and in-domain data. We ran one of
the simplest adaptation scenarios where we concate-
nated the in-domain material (train part of the URL
corpus) to the out-domain one (Hansard corpus) for
the two feeds we considered in Table 3. The results
are reported in Table 4.

We measured significant gains both in WER and
BLEU scores in conducting training time versus tun-
ing time adaptation, for the canadabusiness feed (the
largest URL corpus). For this corpus, we observe
an interesting gain of more than 6 absolute points in
BLEU scores. However, for the DFAIT MAECI (the
smallest URL corpus) we note a very modest loss in
translation quality when translating from French and
a significant gain in the other translation direction.
These figures could show that mining parallel sen-
tences present in URLs is a fruitful strategy for adapt-
ing the translation engine for feeds like canadabusi-
ness that display poor performance otherwise, with-
out harming the translation quality for feeds that per-

Unfortunately, it suggests that retraining a system is
required for better performance, which might hinder
the deployment of a standalone translation engine.
Further research needs to be carried out to determine
how many tweet pairs must be used in a parallel URL
corpus in order to get a sufficiently good in-domain
corpus.

4 Analysis

4.1 Translation output

Examples of translations produced by the best sys-
tem we trained are reported in Figure 3. The first
translation shows a case of an unknown French word
(soumissionnez). The second example illustrates

85



a typical example where the hashtags should have
been translated but were left unchanged. The third
example shows a correct translation, except that the
length of the translation (once the text is detok-
enized) is over the size limit allowed for a tweet.
Those problems are further analyzed in the remain-
ing subsections.

4.2 Unknown words

Unknown words negatively impact the quality of
MT output in several ways. First, they typically ap-
pear untranslated in the system’s output (we deemed
most appropriate this last resort strategy). Sec-
ondly, they perturb the language model, which often
causes other problems (such as dubious word order-
ing). Table 5 reports the main characteristics of the
words from all the tweets we collected that were not
present in the Hansard train corpus.

The out-of-vocabulary rate with respect to token
types hovers around 33% for both languages. No
less than 42% (resp. 37%) of the unknown English
(resp. French) token types are actually hashtags. We
defer their analysis to the next section. Also, 15%
(resp. 10%) of unknown English token types are
user names (@user), which do not require transla-
tion.

Table 5: Statistics on out-of-vocabulary token types.

We manually analyzed 100 unknown token types
that were not hashtags or usernames and that did not
contain any digit. We classified them into a num-
ber of broad classes whose distributions are reported
in Table 6 for the French unknown types. A simi-
lar distribution was observed for English unknown
types. While we could not decide of the nature of
21 types without their context of use (line ?type),
we frequently observed English types, as well as
acronyms and proper names. A few unknown types
result from typos, while many are indeed true French

types unseen at training time (row labeled french ),
some of which being very specific (term). Amus-
ingly, the French verbal neologism twitter (to tweet)
is unknown to the Hansard corpus we used.

Table 6: Distribution of 100 unknown French token types
(excluding hashtags and usernames).

4.3 Dealing with Hashtags
We have already seen that translating the text in
hashtags is often suitable, but not always. Typically,
hashtags in the middle of a sentence are to be trans-
lated, while those at the end typically should not be.
A model should be designed for learning when to
translate an hashtag or not. Also, some hashtags are
part of the sentence, while others are just (semantic)
tags. While a simple strategy for translating hash-
tags consists in removing the # sign at translation
time, then restoring it afterwards, this strategy would
fail in a number of cases that require segmenting the
text of the hashtag first. Table 7 reports the per-
centage of hashtags that should be segmented before
being translated, according to a manual analysis we
conducted over 1000 hashtags in both languages we
considered. While many hashtags are single words,
roughly 20% of them are not and require segmenta-
tion.

4.4 Translating under size constraints
The 140 character limit Twitter imposes on tweets is
well known and demands a certain degree of conci-
sion even human users find sometimes bothersome.
For machine output, this limit becomes a challeng-
ing problem. While there exists plain–but inelegant–
workarounds9, there may be a way to produce tweet
translations that are themselves Twitter-ready. (Jehl,

2010) pointed out this problem and reported that
3.4% of tweets produced were overlong, when trans-
lating from German to English. The reverse direc-
tions produced 17.2% of overlong German tweets.
To remedy this, she tried modifying the way BLEU
is computed to penalize long translation during the
tuning process, with BLEU scores worse than sim-
ply truncating the illegal tweets. The second strategy
the author tried consisted in generating n-best lists
and mining them to find legal tweets, with encour-
aging results (for n = 30 000), since the number
of overlong tweets was significantly reduced while
leaving BLEU scores unharmed.

In order to assess the importance of the problem
for our system, we measured the lengths of tweets
that a system trained like hans+canbusiness in Ta-
ble 4 (a mix of in- and out-of-domain data) could
produce. This time however, we used a larger test set

and provides a link to read the remainder. One could also simply
truncate an illegal tweet and hope for the best...

counting 498 tweets. To measure the lengths of their
translations, we first had to detokenize the transla-
tions produced, since the limitation applies to “nat-
ural” text only. For each URL serialized token, we
counted 18 characters, the average length of a (short-
ened) url in a tweet. When translating from French
to English, the 498 translations had lengths ranging
from 45 to 138 characters; hence, they were all legal
tweets. From English to French, however, the trans-
lations are longer, and range from 32 characters to
223 characters, with 22.5% of them overlong.

One must recall that in our experiments, no tweets
were seen at training or tuning time, which explains
why the rate of translations that do not meet the
limit is high. This problem deserves a specific treat-
ment for a system to be deployed. One interest-
ing solution already described by (Jehl, 2010) is to
mine the n-best list produced by the decoder in or-
der to find the first candidate that constitutes a legal
tweet. This candidate is then picked as the trans-
lation. We performed this analysis on the canad-
abusiness output described earlier, from English to
French. We used n =1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500,
1000, 5000, 10000, 30000 and computed the result-
ing BLEU scores and remaining percentage of over-
long tweets. The results are shown in Figure 4. The
results clearly show that the n-best list does contain
alternate candidates when the best one is too long.
Indeed, not only do we observe that the percentage
of remaining illegal tweets can fall steadily (from
22.4% to 6.6% for n = 30 000) as we dig deeper into
the list, but also the BLEU score stays unharmed,
showing even a slight improvement, from an ini-

tial 26.16 to 26.31 for n = 30 000. This counter-
intuitive result in terms of BLEU is also reported
in (Jehl, 2010) and is probably due to a less harsh
brevity penalty by BLEU on shorter candidates.

5 Discussion

We presented a number of experiments where we
translated tweets produced by Canadian govern-
ments institutions and organizations. Those tweets
have the distinguishing characteristic (in the Twitter-
sphere) of being written in proper English or French.
We show that mining the urls mentioned in those
tweets for parallel sentences can be a fruitful strat-
egy for adapting an out-of-domain translation engine
to this task, although further research could show
other ways of using this resource, whose quality
seems to be high according to our manual evalua-
tion. We also analyzed the main problems that re-
main to be addressed before deploying a useful sys-
tem.

While we focused here on acquiring useful cor-
pora for adapting a translation engine, we admit that
the adaptation scenario we considered is very sim-
plistic, although efficient. We are currently inves-
tigating the merit of different methods to adaptation
(Zhao et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2010; Daume III and
Jagarlamudi, 2011; Razmara et al., 2012; Sankaran
et al., 2012).

Unknown words are of concern, and should be

dealt with appropriately. The serialization of urls
was natural, but it could be extended to usernames.
The latter do not need to be translated, but reduc-
ing the vocabulary is always desirable when work-
ing with a statistical machine translation engine.
One interesting subcategories of out-of-vocabulary
tokens are hashtags. According to our analysis,
they require segmentation into words before being
translated in 20% of the cases. Even if they are
transformed into regular words (#radon→radon or
#genderequality→gender equality), however, it is
not clear at this point how to detect if they are used
like normally-occurring words in a sentence, as in
(#radon is harmful) or if they are simply tags added
to the tweet to categorize it.

We also showed that translating under size con-
straints can be handled easily by mining the n-best
list produced by the decoder, but only up to a point.
A remaining 6% of the tweets we analyzed in detail
could not find a shorter version. Numerous ideas
are possible to alleviate the problem. One could for
instance modify the logic of the decoder to penal-
ize hypotheses that promise to yield overlong trans-
lations. Another idea would be to manually in-
spect the strategies used by governmental agencies
on Twitter when attempting to shorten their mes-
sages, and to select those that seem acceptable and
implementable, like the suppression of articles or the
use of authorized abbreviations.

Adapting a translation pipeline to the very specific
world of governmental tweets therefore poses mul-
tiple challenges, each of which can be addressed in
numerous ways. We have reported here the results of
a modest but fertile subset of these adaptation strate-
gies.
