Abstract

Different approaches to high-quality
grammatical error correction have been
proposed recently, many of which have
their own strengths and weaknesses. Most
of these approaches are based on classi-
fication or statistical machine translation
(SMT). In this paper, we propose to com-
bine the output from a classification-based
system and an SMT-based system to
improve the correction quality. We adopt
the system combination technique of
Heafield and Lavie (2010). We achieve an
F0.5 score of 39.39% on the test set of the
CoNLL-2014 shared task, outperforming
the best system in the shared task.

1 Introduction

Grammatical error correction (GEC) refers to the
task of detecting and correcting grammatical er-
rors present in a text written by a second language
learner. For example, a GEC system to correct
English promises to benefit millions of learners
around the world, since it functions as a learning
aid by providing instantaneous feedback on ESL
writing.

Research in this area has attracted much interest
recently, with four shared tasks organized in the
past several years: Helping Our Own (HOO) 2011
and 2012 (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010; Dale et al.,
2012), and the CoNLL 2013 and 2014 shared tasks
(Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014). Each shared task
comes with an annotated corpus of learner texts
and a benchmark test set, facilitating further re-
search in GEC.

Many approaches have been proposed to de-
tect and correct grammatical errors. The most
dominant approaches are based on classification
(a set of classifier modules where each module ad-
dresses a specific error type) and statistical ma-

chine translation (SMT) (formulated as a transla-
tion task from “bad” to “good” English). Other ap-
proaches combine the classification and SMT ap-
proaches, and often have some rule-based compo-
nents.

Each approach has its own strengths and weak-
nesses. Since the classification approach is able to
focus on each individual error type using a sep-
arate classifier, it may perform better on an er-
ror type where it can build a custom-made classi-
fier tailored to the error type, such as subject-verb
agreement errors. The drawback of the classifica-
tion approach is that one classifier must be built
for each error type, so a comprehensive GEC sys-
tem will need to build many classifiers which com-
plicates its design. Furthermore, the classification
approach does not address multiple error types that
may interact.

The SMT approach, on the other hand, natu-
rally takes care of interaction among words in a
sentence as it attempts to find the best overall cor-
rected sentence. It usually has a better coverage
of different error types. The drawback of this ap-
proach is its reliance on error-annotated learner
data, which is expensive to produce. It is not pos-
sible to build a competitive SMT system without a
sufficiently large parallel training corpus, consist-
ing of texts written by ESL learners and the corre-
sponding corrected texts.

In this work, we aim to take advantage of both
the classification and the SMT approaches. By
combining the outputs of both systems, we hope
that the strengths of one approach will offset the
weaknesses of the other approach. We adopt the
system combination technique of (Heafield and
Lavie, 2010), which starts by creating word-level
alignments among multiple outputs. By perform-
ing beam search over these alignments, it tries
to find the best corrected sentence that combines
parts of multiple system outputs.

The main contributions of this paper are as fol-

lows:

• It is the first work that makes use of a system
combination strategy to improve grammatical
error correction;

• It gives a detailed description of methods
and experimental setup for building compo-
nent systems using two state-of-the-art ap-
proaches; and

• It provides a detailed analysis of how one ap-
proach can benefit from the other approach
through system combination.

We evaluate our system combination approach
on the CoNLL-2014 shared task. The approach
achieves an F0.5 score of 39.39%, outperforming
the best participating team in the shared task.

combination. Finally, Section 8 concludes the pa-
per.

2 Related Work

2.1 Grammatical Error Correction
Early research in grammatical error correction fo-
cused on a single error type in isolation. For ex-
ample, Knight and Chander (1994) built an article
correction system for post-editing machine trans-
lation output.

The classification approach has been used to
deal with the most common grammatical mistakes
made by ESL learners, such as article and prepo-
sition errors (Han et al., 2006; Chodorow et al.,
2007; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Gamon,
2010; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011; Rozovskaya and
Roth, 2011; Wu and Ng, 2013), and more recently,
verb errors (Rozovskaya et al., 2014b). Statis-
tical classifiers are trained either from learner or
non-learner texts. Features are extracted from the
sentence context. Typically, these are shallow fea-
tures, such as surrounding n-grams, part-of-speech
(POS) tags, chunks, etc. Different sets of fea-
tures are employed depending on the error type
addressed.

The statistical machine translation (SMT) ap-
proach has gained more interest recently. Earlier

work was done by Brockett et al. (2006), where
they used SMT to correct mass noun errors. The
major impediment in using the SMT approach for
GEC is the lack of error-annotated learner (“par-
allel”) corpora. Mizumoto et al. (2011) mined a
learner corpus from the social learning platform
Lang-8 and built an SMT system for correcting
grammatical errors in Japanese. They further tried
their method for English (Mizumoto et al., 2012).

Other approaches combine the advantages of
classification and SMT (Dahlmeier and Ng,
2012a) and sometimes also include rule-based
components. Note that in the hybrid approaches
proposed previously, the output of each compo-
nent system might be only partially corrected for
some subset of error types. This is different from
our system combination approach, where the out-
put of each component system is a complete cor-
rection of the input sentence where all error types
are dealt with.

State-of-the-art performance is achieved by
both the classification (Dahlmeier et al., 2012;
Rozovskaya et al., 2013; Rozovskaya et al.,
2014a) and the SMT approach (Felice et al., 2014;
Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014),
which motivates us to attempt system output com-
bination from both approaches.

2.2 System Combination

System combination is the task of combining the
outputs of multiple systems to produce an out-
put better than each of its individual component
systems. In machine translation (MT), combin-
ing multiple MT outputs has been attempted in
the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
(Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Bojar et al., 2011).

One of the common approaches in system com-
bination is the confusion network approach (Rosti
et al., 2007b). In this approach, a confusion net-
work is created by aligning the outputs of multi-
ple systems. The combined output is generated by
choosing the output of one single system as the
“backbone”, and aligning the outputs of all other
systems to this backbone. The word order of the
combined output will then follow the word order
of the backbone. The alignment step is critical in
system combination. If there is an alignment er-
ror, the resulting combined output sentence may
be ungrammatical.

Rosti et al. (2007a) evaluated three system com-
bination methods in their work:

952



• Sentence level This method looks at the com-
bined N-best list of the systems and selects
the best output.

• Phrase level This method creates new hy-
potheses using a new phrase translation ta-
ble, built according to the phrase alignments
of the systems.

• Word level This method creates a graph by
aligning the hypotheses of the systems. The
confidence score of each aligned word is then
calculated according to the votes from the hy-
potheses.

Combining different component sub-systems
was attempted by CUUI (Rozovskaya et al.,
2014a) and CAMB (Felice et al., 2014) in the
CoNLL-2014 shared task. The CUUI system em-
ploys different classifiers to correct various error
types and then merges the results. The CAMB
system uses a pipeline of systems to combine the
outputs of their rule based system and their SMT
system. The combination methods used in those
systems are different from our approach, because
they combine individual sub-system components,
by piping the output from one sub-system to an-
other, whereas we combine the outputs of whole
systems. Moreover, our approach is able to com-
bine the advantages of both the classification and
SMT approaches. In the field of grammatical error
correction, our work is novel as it is the first that
uses system combination to improve grammatical
error correction.

3 The Component Systems

We build four individual error correction systems.
Two systems are pipeline systems based on the
classification approach, whereas the other two are
phrase-based SMT systems. In this section, we
describe how we build each system.

3.1 Pipeline
We build two different pipeline systems. Each sys-
tem consists of a sequence of classifier-based cor-
rection steps. We use two different sequences of
correction steps as shown in Table 1. As shown
by the table, the only difference between the two
pipeline systems is that we swap the noun number
and the article correction step. We do this because
there is an interaction between noun number and
article correction. Swapping them generates sys-
tem outputs that are quite different.

Step Pipeline 1 (P1) Pipeline 2 (P2)
1 Spelling Spelling
2 Noun number Article
3 Preposition Preposition
4 Punctuation Punctuation
5 Article Noun number
6 Verb form, SVA Verb form, SVA

Table 1: The two pipeline systems.

We model each of the article, preposition, and
noun number correction task as a multi-class clas-
sification problem. A separate multi-class confi-
dence weighted classifier (Crammer et al., 2009)
is used for correcting each of these error types. A
correction is only made if the difference between
the scores of the original class and the proposed
class is larger than a threshold tuned on the devel-
opment set. The features of the article and prepo-
sition classifiers follow the features used by the
NUS system from HOO 2012 (Dahlmeier et al.,
2012). For the noun number error type, we use
lexical n-grams, ngram counts, dependency rela-
tions, noun lemma, and countability features.

For article correction, the classes are the arti-
cles a, the, and the null article. The article an
is considered to be the same class as a. A sub-
sequent post-processing step chooses between a
and an based on the following word. For prepo-
sition correction, we choose 36 common English
prepositions as used in (Dahlmeier et al., 2012).
We only deal with preposition replacement but not
preposition insertion or deletion. For noun number
correction, the classes are singular and plural.

Punctuation, subject-verb agreement (SVA),
and verb form errors are corrected using rule-
based classifiers. For SVA errors, we assume that
noun number errors have already been corrected
by classifiers earlier in the pipeline. Hence, only
the verb is corrected when an SVA error is de-
tected. For verb form errors, we change a verb into
its base form if it is preceded by a modal verb, and
we change it into the past participle form if it is
preceded by has, have, or had.

The spelling corrector uses Jazzy, an open
source Java spell-checker1. We filter the sugges-
tions given by Jazzy using a language model. We
accept a suggestion from Jazzy only if the sugges-
tion increases the language model score of the sen-
tence.

3.2 Statistical Machine Translation
The other two component systems are based
on phrase-based statistical machine translation
(Koehn et al., 2003). It follows the well-
known log-linear model formulation (Och and
Ney, 2002):

ê = arg max
e

P (e|f)

= arg max
e

exp

(
M∑

m=1

λmhm(e, f)

)
(1)

where f is the input sentence, e is the corrected
output sentence, hm is a feature function, and λm
is its weight. The feature functions include a trans-
lation model learned from a sentence-aligned par-
allel corpus and a language model learned from a
large English corpus. More feature functions can
be integrated into the log-linear model. A decoder
finds the best correction ê that maximizes Equa-
tion 1 above.

The parallel corpora that we use to train
the translation model come from two different
sources. The first corpus is NUCLE (Dahlmeier et
al., 2013), containing essays written by students at
the National University of Singapore (NUS) which
have been manually corrected by English instruc-
tors at NUS. The other corpus is collected from
the language exchange social networking website
Lang-8. We develop two versions of SMT sys-
tems: one with two phrase tables trained on NU-
CLE and Lang-8 separately (S1), and the other
with a single phrase table trained on the concate-
nation of NUCLE and Lang-8 data (S2). Multiple
phrase tables are used with alternative decoding
paths (Birch et al., 2007). We add a word-level
Levenshtein distance feature in the phrase table
used by S2, similar to (Felice et al., 2014; Junczys-
Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014). This feature
is not included in S1.

4 System Combination

We use MEMT (Heafield and Lavie, 2010) to
combine the outputs of our systems. MEMT uses
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) to perform
alignment of each pair of outputs from the compo-
nent systems. The METEOR matcher can identify
exact matches, words with identical stems, syn-
onyms, and unigram paraphrases.

MEMT uses an approach similar to the confu-
sion network approach in SMT system combina-
tion. The difference is that it performs alignment

on the outputs of every pair of component systems,
so it does not need to choose a single backbone.
As MEMT does not choose any single system out-
put as its backbone, it can consider the output of
each component system in a symmetrical manner.
This increases word order flexibility, as choosing
a single hypothesis as the backbone will limit the
number of possible word order permutations.

After creating pairwise alignments using ME-
TEOR, the alignments form a confusion network.
MEMT will then perform a beam search over this
graph to find the one-best hypothesis. The search
is carried out from left to right, one word at a time,
creating a partial hypothesis. During beam search,
it can freely switch among the component sys-
tems, combining the outputs together into a sen-
tence. When it adds a word to its hypothesis, all
the words aligned to it in the other systems are also
marked as “used”. If it switches to another input
sentence, it has to use the first “unused” word in
that sentence. This is done to make sure that ev-
ery aligned word in the sentences is used. In some
cases, a heuristic could be used to allow skipping
over some words (Heafield et al., 2009).

During beam search, MEMT uses a few features
to score the hypotheses (both partial hypotheses
and full hypotheses):

• Length The number of tokens in a hypoth-
esis. It is useful to normalize the impact of
sentence length.

• Language model Log probability from a lan-
guage model. It is especially useful in main-
taining sentence fluency.

• Backoff The average n-gram length found in
the language model.

• Match The number of n-gram matches be-
tween the outputs of the component systems
and the hypothesis, counted for small order
n-grams.

The weights of these features are tuned using Z-
MERT (Zaidan, 2009) on a development set.

This system combination approach has a few
advantages in grammatical error correction. ME-
TEOR not only can match words with exact
matches, but also words with identical stems, syn-
onyms, and unigram paraphrases. This means that
it can deal with word form, noun number, and verb
form corrections that share identical stems, as well

as word choice corrections (with synonyms and
unigram paraphrases). Also, MEMT uses a lan-
guage model feature to maintain sentence fluency,
favoring grammatical output sentences.

In this paper, we combine the pipeline system
P1 (Table 1) with the SMT system S1, and also
combine P2 with S2. The two component sys-
tems in each pair have comparable performance.
For our final system, we also combine all four sys-
tems together.

5 Experiments

Our approach is evaluated in the context of the
CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error
correction. Specific details of the shared task can
be found in the overview paper (Ng et al., 2014),
but we summarize the most important details rele-
vant to our study here.

5.1 Data
We use NUCLE version 3.2 (Dahlmeier et al.,
2013), the official training data of the CoNLL-
2014 shared task, to train our component systems.
The grammatical errors in this corpus are catego-
rized into 28 different error types. We also use the
“Lang-8 Corpus of Learner English v1.0”2 (Tajiri
et al., 2012) to obtain additional learner data. En-
glish Wikipedia3 is used for language modeling
and collecting n-gram counts. All systems are
tuned on the CoNLL-2013 test data (which serves
as the development data set) and tested on the
CoNLL-2014 test data. The statistics of the data
sets can be found in Table 2.

5.2 Evaluation
System performance is evaluated based on pre-
cision, recall, and F0.5 (which weights precision
twice as much as recall). Given a set of n sen-
tences, where gi is the set of gold-standard edits

2http://cl.naist.jp/nldata/lang-8/
3http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20140102/enwiki-

20140102-pages-articles.xml.bz2

for sentence i, and ei is the set of system edits for
sentence i, precision, recall, and F0.5 are defined
as follows:

P =
∑n

i=1 |gi ∩ ei|∑n
i=1 |ei|

(2)

R =
∑n

i=1 |gi ∩ ei|∑n
i=1 |gi|

(3)

F0.5 =
(1 + 0.52)×R× P
R+ 0.52 × P (4)

where the intersection between gi and ei for sen-
tence i is defined as

gi ∩ ei = {e ∈ ei|∃g ∈ gi,match(g, e)} (5)

The official scorer for the shared task was
the MaxMatch (M2) scorer4 (Dahlmeier and Ng,
2012b). The scorer computes the sequence of sys-
tem edits between a source sentence and a system
hypothesis that achieves the maximal overlap with
the gold-standard edits. Like CoNLL-2014, F0.5
is used instead of F1 to emphasize precision. For
statistical significance testing, we use the sign test
with bootstrap re-sampling on 100 samples.

5.3 Pipeline System
We use ClearNLP5 for POS tagging and depen-
dency parsing, and OpenNLP for chunking6. We
use the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) morphology
software to generate singular and plural word sur-
face forms.

The article, preposition, and noun number cor-
rectors use the classifier approach to correct errors.
Each classifier is trained using multi-class confi-
dence weighted learning on the NUCLE and Lang-
8 corpora. The classifier threshold is tuned using a
simple grid search on the development data set for
each class of a classifier.

5.4 SMT System
The system is trained using Moses (Koehn et al.,
2007), with Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) for word
alignment. The translation table is trained using
the “parallel” corpora of NUCLE and Lang-8. The
table contains phrase pairs of maximum length
seven. We include five standard parameters in the
translation table: forward and reverse phrase trans-
lations, forward and reverse lexical translations,

and phrase penalty. We further add a word-level
Levenshtein distance feature for S2.

We do not use any reordering model in our sys-
tem. The intuition is that most error types do not
involve long-range reordering and local reorder-
ing can be easily captured in the phrase translation
table. The distortion limit is set to 0 to prohibit
reordering during hypothesis generation.

We build two 5-gram language models using the
corrected side of NUCLE and English Wikipedia.
The language models are estimated using the
KenLM toolkit (Heafield et al., 2013) with mod-
ified Kneser-Ney smoothing. These two language
models are used as separate feature functions in
the log-linear model. Finally, they are binarized
into a probing data structure (Heafield, 2011).
Tuning is done on the development data set with
MERT (Och, 2003). We use BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002) as the tuning metric, which turns out to
work well in our experiment.

5.5 Combined System
We use an open source MEMT implementation
by Heafield and Lavie (2010) to combine the out-
puts of our systems. Parameters are set to the val-
ues recommended by (Heafield and Lavie, 2010):
a beam size of 500, word skipping using length
heuristic with radius 5, and with the length nor-
malization option turned off. We use five match-
ing features for each system: the number of exact
unigram and bigram matches between hypotheses
and the number of matches in terms of stems, syn-
onyms, or paraphrases for unigrams, bigrams, and
trigrams. We use the Wikipedia 5-gram language
model in this experiment.

We tune the combined system on the develop-
ment data set. The test data is input into both
the pipeline and SMT system respectively and the
output from each system is then matched using
METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005). Feature
weights, based on BLEU, are then tuned using Z-
MERT (Zaidan, 2009). We repeat this process five
times and use the weights that achieve the best
score on the development data set in our final com-
bined system.

5.6 Results
Our experimental results using the CoNLL-2014
test data as the test set are shown in Table 3. Each
system is evaluated against the same gold standard
human annotations. As recommended in Ng et al.
(2014), we do not use the revised gold standard to

ensure a fairer evaluation (i.e., without using alter-
native answers).

First, we can see that both the pipeline and
SMT systems individually achieve relatively good
results that are comparable with the third high-
est ranking participant in the CoNLL-2014 shared
task. It is worth noting that the pipeline systems
only target the seven most common error types,
yet still perform well in an all-error-type setting.
In general, the pipeline systems have higher recall
but lower precision than the SMT systems.

The pipeline system is also sensitive to the or-
der in which corrections are applied; for example
applying noun number corrections before article
corrections results in a better score. This means
that there is definitely some interaction between
grammatical errors and, for instance, the phrase a
houses can be corrected to a house or houses de-
pending on the order of correction.

We noticed that the performance of the SMT
system could be improved by using multiple trans-
lation models. This is most likely due to domain
differences between the NUCLE and Lang-8 cor-
pus, e.g., text genres, writing style, topics, etc.
Note also that the Lang-8 corpus is more than
10 times larger than the NUCLE corpus, so there

is some benefit from training and weighting two
translation tables separately.

The performance of the pipeline system P1 is
comparable to that of the SMT system S1, and
likewise the performance of P2 is comparable to
that of S2. The differences between them are not
statistically significant, making it appropriate to
combine their respective outputs.

Every combined system achieves a better result
than its component systems. In every combina-
tion, there is some improvement in precision over
the pipeline systems, and some improvement in re-
call over the SMT systems. The combination of
the better component systems (P1+S1) is also sta-
tistically significantly better than the combination
of the other component systems (P2+S2). Com-
bining all four component systems yields an even
better result of 39.39% F0.5, which is even better
than the CoNLL-2014 shared task winner. This is
significant because the individual component sys-
tems barely reached the score of the third highest
ranking participant before they were combined.

6 Discussion

In this section, we discuss the strengths and weak-
nesses of the pipeline and SMT systems, and show
how system output combination improves perfor-
mance. Specifically, we compare P1, S1, and
P1+S1, although the discussion also applies to P2,
S2, and P2+S2.

Type performance. We start by computing the
recall for each of the 28 error types achieved by
each system. This computation is straightforward
as each gold standard edit is also annotated with
error type. On the other hand, precision, as men-
tioned in the overview paper (Ng et al., 2014), is
much harder to compute because systems typically
do not categorize their corrections by error type.
Although it may be possible to compute the pre-
cision for each error type in the pipeline system
(since we know which correction was proposed by
which classifier), this is more difficult to do in the
SMT and combined system, where we would need
to rely on heuristics which are more prone to er-
rors. As a result, we decided to analyze a sample
of 200 sentences by hand for a comparatively more
robust comparison. The results can be seen in Ta-
ble 4.

We observe that the pipeline system has a higher
recall than the SMT system for the following er-
ror types: ArtOrDet, Mec, Nn, Prep, SVA, Vform,

and Vt. Conversely, the SMT system generally has
a higher precision than the pipeline system. The
combined system usually has slightly lower pre-
cision than the SMT system, but higher than the
pipeline system, and slightly higher recall than the
SMT system but lower than the pipeline system.
In some cases however, like for Vform correction,
both precision and recall increase.

The combined system can also make use of cor-
rections which are only corrected in one of the
systems. For example, it corrects both Wform
and Pform errors, which are only corrected by the
SMT system, and SVA errors, which are only cor-
rected by the pipeline system.

Error analysis. For illustration on how sys-
tem combination helps, we provide example out-
put from the pipeline system P1, SMT system
S1, and the combined system P1+S1 in Table 5.
We illustrate three common scenarios where sys-
tem combination helps: the first is when P1 per-
forms better than S1, and the combined system
chooses the corrections made by P1, the second is
the opposite where S1 performs better than P1 and
the combined system chooses S1, and the last is
when the combined system combines the correc-
tions made by P1 and S1 to produce output better
than both P1 and S1.

7 Additional System Combination
Experiments

We further evaluate our system combination ap-
proach by making use of the corrected system out-
puts of 12 participating teams in the CoNLL-2014
shared task, which are publicly available on the
shared task website.7 Specifically, we combined
the system outputs of the top 2, 3, . . . , 12 CoNLL-
2014 shared task teams and computed the results.

In our earlier experiments, the CoNLL-2013
test data was used as the development set. How-
ever, the participants’ outputs for this 2013 data
are not available. Therefore, we split the CoNLL-
2014 test data into two parts: the first 500 sen-
tences for the development set and the remaining
812 sentences for the test set. We then tried com-
bining the n best performing systems, for n =
2, 3, . . . , 12. Other than the data, the experimen-
tal setup is the same as that described in Sec-
tion 5.5. Table 6 shows the ranking of the par-
ticipants on the 812 test sentences (without alter-

the original CoNLL-2014 test data for testing, the
ranking is different from the official CoNLL-2014
ranking.

Table 7 shows the results of system combina-
tion in terms of increasing numbers of top sys-
tems. We observe consistent improvements in F0.5
when we combine more system outputs, up to 5
best performing systems. When combining 6 or
more systems, the performance starts to fluctu-
ate and degrade. An important observation is that
when we perform system combination, it is more
effective, in terms of F0.5, to combine a handful
of high-quality system outputs than many outputs

of variable quality. Precision tends to increase as
more systems are combined although recall tends
to decrease. This indicates that combining multi-
ple systems can produce a grammatical error cor-
rection system with high precision, which is useful
in a practical application setting where high preci-
sion is desirable. Figure 1 shows how the perfor-
mance varies as the number of combined systems
increases.

8 Conclusion

We have presented a system combination ap-
proach for grammatical error correction using
MEMT. Our approach combines the outputs from
two of the most common paradigms in GEC: the
pipeline and statistical machine translation ap-

proach. We created two variants of the pipeline
and statistical machine translation approaches and
showed that system combination can be used to
combine their outputs together to yield a superior
system.

Our best combined system achieves an F0.5
score of 39.39% on the official CoNLL 2014 test
set without alternative answers, higher than the top
participating team in CoNLL 2014 on this data
set. We achieved this by using component systems
which were individually weaker than the top three
systems that participated in the shared task.
