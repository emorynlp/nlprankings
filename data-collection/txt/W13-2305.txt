Abstract

We explore the use of continuous rat-
ing scales for human evaluation in the
context of machine translation evaluation,
comparing two assessor-intrinsic quality-
control techniques that do not rely on
agreement with expert judgments. Ex-
periments employing Amazon’s Mechan-
ical Turk service show that quality-control
techniques made possible by the use of
the continuous scale show dramatic im-
provements to intra-annotator agreement
of up to +0.101 in the kappa coefficient,
with inter-annotator agreement increasing
by up to +0.144 when additional standard-
ization of scores is applied.

1 Introduction

Human annotations of language are often required
in natural language processing (NLP) tasks for
evaluation purposes, in order to estimate how well
a given system mimics activities traditionally per-
formed by humans. In tasks such as machine
translation (MT) and natural language generation,
the system output is a fully-formed string in a tar-
get language. Annotations can take the form of
direct estimates of the quality of those outputs or
be structured as the simpler task of ranking com-
peting outputs from best-to-worst (Callison-Burch
et al., 2012).

A direct estimation method of assessment, as
opposed to ranking outputs from best-to-worst,
has the advantage that it includes in annotations
not only that one output is better than another,
but also the degree to which that output was bet-
ter than the other. In addition, direct estimation
of quality within the context of machine transla-
tion extends the usefulness of the annotated data
to other tasks such as quality-estimation (Callison-
Burch et al., 2012).

For an evaluation to be credible, the annotations
must be credible. The simplest way of establish-
ing this is to have the same data point annotated by
multiple annotators, and measure the agreement
between them. There has been a worrying trend
in recent MT shared tasks – whether the evalu-
ation was structured as ranking translations from
best-to-worst, or by direct estimation of fluency
and adequacy – of agreement between annotators
decreasing (Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-
Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010;
Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Callison-Burch et al.,
2012). Inconsistency in human evaluation of ma-
chine translation calls into question conclusions
drawn from those assessments, and is the target
of this paper: by revising the annotation process,
can we improve annotator agreement, and hence
the quality of human annotations?

Direct estimates of quality are intrinsically con-
tinuous in nature, but are often collected using an
interval-level scale with a relatively low number
of categories, perhaps to make the task cognitively
easier for human assessors. In MT evaluation,
five and seven-point interval-level scales are com-
mon (Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Denkowski and
Lavie, 2010). However, the interval-level scale
commonly used for direct estimation of translation
quality (and other NLP annotation tasks) forces
human judges to discretize their assessments into
a fixed number of categories, and this process
could be a cause of inconsistency in human judg-
ments. In particular, an assessor may be repeatedly
forced to choose between two categories, neither
of which really fits their judgment. The contin-
uous nature of translation quality assessment, as
well as the fact that many statistical methods ex-
ist that can be applied to continuous data but not
interval-level data, motivates our trial of a contin-
uous rating scale.

We use human judgments of translation fluency
as a test case and compare consistency levels when

33



the conventional 5-point interval-level scale and a
continuous visual analog scale (VAS) are used for
human evaluation. We collected data via Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk, where the quality of an-
notations is known to vary considerably (Callison-
Burch et al., 2010). As such, we test two quality-
control techniques based on statistical significance
– made possible by the use of the continuous rating
scale – to intrinsically assess the quality of individ-
ual human judges. The quality-control techniques
are not restricted to fluency judgments and are rel-
evant to more general MT evaluation, as well as
other NLP annotation tasks.

2 Machine Translation Fluency

Measurement of fluency as a component of MT
evaluation has been carried out for a number of
years (LDC, 2005), but it has proven difficult
to acquire consistent judgments, even from ex-
pert assessors. Evaluation rounds such as the an-
nual Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
(WMT) use human judgments of translation qual-
ity to produce official rankings in shared tasks, ini-
tially using an two-item assessment of fluency and
adequacy as separate attributes, and more recently
by asking judges to simply rank system outputs
against one another according to “which transla-
tion is better”. However, the latter method also re-
ports low levels of agreement between judges. For
example, the 2007 WMT reported low levels of
consistency in fluency judgments in terms of both
intra-annotator agreement (intra-aa), with a kappa
coefficient of κ = 0.54 (moderate), and inter-
annotator agreement (inter-aa), with κ = 0.25
(slight). Adequacy judgments for the same data
received even lower scores: κ = 0.47 for intra-aa,
and κ = 0.23 for inter-aa.

While concerns over annotator agreement have
seen recent WMT evaluations move away from us-
ing fluency as an evaluation component, there can
be no question that fluency is a useful means of
evaluating translation output. In particular, it is not
biased by reference translations. The use of auto-
matic metrics is often criticized by the fact that
a system that produces a good translation which
happens not to be similar to the reference trans-
lations will be unfairly penalized. Similarly, if
human annotators are provided with one or more
reference sentences, they may inadvertently favor
translations that are similar to those references. If
fluency is judged independently of adequacy, no

reference translation is needed, and the bias is re-
moved.

In earlier work, we consider the possibility
that translation quality is a hypothetical construct
(Graham et al., 2012), and suggest applying meth-
ods of validating measurement of psychological
constructs to the validation of measurements of
translation quality. In psychology, a scale that em-
ploys more items as opposed to fewer is consid-
ered more valid. Under this criteria, a two-item
(fluency and adequacy) scale is more valid than a
single-item translation quality measure.

3 Measurement Scales

Direct estimation methods are designed to elicit
from the subject a direct quantitative estimate of
the magnitude of an attribute (Streiner and Nor-
man, 1989). We compare judgments collected
on a visual analog scale (VAS) to those using an
interval-level scale presented to the human judge
as a sequence of radio-buttons. The VAS was first
used in psychology in the 1920’s, and prior to the
digital age, scales used a line of fixed length (usu-
ally 100mm in length), with anchor labels at both
ends, and to be marked by hand with an “X” at the
desired location (Streiner and Norman, 1989).

When an interval-scale is used in NLP evalua-
tion or other annotation tasks, it is commonly pre-
sented in the form of an adjectival scale, where
categories are labeled in increasing/decreasing
quality. For example, an MT evaluation of fluency
might specify 5 = “Flawless English”, 4 = “Good
English”, 3 = “Non-native English”, 2 = “Disfluent
English”, and 1 = “Incomprehensible” (Callison-
Burch et al., 2007; Denkowski and Lavie, 2010).

With both a VAS and an adjectival scale, the
choice of labels can be critical. In medical re-
search, patients’ ratings of their own health have
been shown to be highly dependent on the ex-
act wording of descriptors (Seymour et al., 1985).
Alexandrov (2010) provides a summary of the ex-
tensive literature on the numerous issues associ-
ated with adjectival scale labels, including bias
resulting from positively and negatively worded
items not being true opposites of one another, and
items intended to have neutral intensity in fact
proving to have unique conceptual meanings.

Likert scales avoid the problems associated with
adjectival labels, by structuring the question as
a simple statement that the respondent registers
their level of (dis)agreement with. Figure 1 shows

the Likert-type interval-level scale we use to col-
lect fluency judgments of MT output, and Fig-
ure 2 shows an equivalent VAS using the two
most extreme anchor labels, strongly disagree and
strongly agree.

4 Crowd-sourcing Judgments

The volume of judgments required for evaluation
of NLP tasks can be large, and employing experts
to undertake those judgments may not always be
feasible. Crowd-sourcing services via the Web of-
fer an attractive alternative, and have been used in
conjunction with a range of NLP evaluation and
annotation tasks. Several guides exist for instruct-
ing researchers from various backgrounds on us-
ing Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) (Gibson et
al., 2011; Callison-Burch, 2009), and allowance
for the use of AMT is increasingly being made
in research grant applications, as a cost-effective
way of gathering data. Issues remain in connec-
tion with low payment levels (Fort et al., 2011);
nevertheless, Ethics Approval Boards are typically
disinterested in projects that make use of AMT, re-
garding AMT as being a purchased service rather
than a part of the experimentation that may affect
human subjects.

The use of crowd-sourced judgments does,
however, introduce the possibility of increased in-
consistency, with service requesters typically hav-

ing no specific or verifiable knowledge about any
given worker. Hence, the possibility that a worker
is acting in good faith but not performing the task
well must be allowed for, as must the likelihood
that some workers will quite ruthlessly seek to
minimize the time spent on the task, by deliber-
ately giving low-quality or fake answers. Some
workers may even attempt to implement auto-
mated responses, so that they get paid without hav-
ing to do the work they are being paid for.

For example, if the task at hand is that of assess-
ing the fluency of text snippets, it is desirable to
employ native speakers. With AMT the requester
has the ability to restrict responses to only workers
who have a specified skill. But that facility does
not necessarily lead to confidence – there is noth-
ing stopping a worker employing someone else
to do the test for them. Devising a test that reli-
ably evaluates whether or not someone is a native
speaker is also not at all straightforward.

Amazon allow location restrictions, based on
the registered residential address of the Turker,
which can be used to select in favor of those likely
to have at least some level of fluency (Callison-
Burch et al., 2010). We initially applied this re-
striction to both sets of judgments in experiments,
setting the task up so that only workers regis-
tered in Germany could evaluate the to-German
translations, for example. However, very low re-

35



sponse rates for languages other than to-English
were problematic, and we also received a number
of apparently-genuine requests from native speak-
ers residing outside the target countries. As a
result, we removed all location restrictions other
than for the to-English tasks.1

Crowd-sourcing judgments has the obvious risk
of being vulnerable to manipulation. On the other
hand, crowd-sourced judgments also offer the po-
tential of being more valid than those of experts,
since person-in-the-street abilities might be a more
useful yardstick for some tasks than informed aca-
demic judgment, and because a greater number of
judges may be available.

Having the ability to somehow evaluate the
quality of the work undertaken by a Turker is thus
highly desirable. We would like to be able to put
in place a mechanism that filters out non-native
speakers; native speakers with low literacy levels;
cheats; and robotic cheats. That goal is considered
in the next section.

5 Judge-Intrinsic Quality Control

One common method of quality assessment for a
new process is to identify a set of “gold-standard”
items that have been judged by experts and whose
merits are agreed, present them to the new process
or assessor, and then assess the degree to which
the new process and the experts “agree” on the
outcomes (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et
al., 2010). A possible concern is that even experts
can be expected to disagree (and hence have low
inter-aa levels), meaning that disagreement with
the new process will also occur, even if the new
process is a reliable one. In addition, the qual-
ity of the judgments collected is also assessed via
agreement levels, meaning that any filtering based
on a quality-control measure that uses agreement
will automatically increase consistency, even to
the extent of recalibrating non-expert workers’ re-
sponses to more closely match expert judgments
(Snow et al., 2008). Moreover, if an interval-level
scale is used, standardized scores cannot be em-
ployed, so a non-expert who is more lenient than
the experts, but in a reliable and systematic man-
ner, might still have their assessments discarded.

For judgments collected on a continuous scale,
statistical tests based on difference of means (over
assessors) are possible. We structure our human

istration by country; official information is unclear about this.

intelligence tasks (HITs) on Mechanical Turk in
groups of 100 in a way that allows us to control
assignment of repeat item pairs to workers, so that
statistical tests can later be applied to an individ-
ual worker’s score distributions for repeat items.
Workers were made aware of the task structure
before accepting it – the task preview included a
message This HIT consists of 100 fluency assess-
ments, you have 0 so far complete.

We refer to the repeat items in a HIT as
ask again translations. In addition, we inserted a
number of bad reference pairs into each HIT, with
a bad reference pair consisting of a genuine MT
system output, and a distorted sentence derived
from it, expecting that its fluency was markedly
worse than that of the corresponding system out-
put. This was done by randomly selecting two
words in the sentence and duplicating them in ran-
dom locations not adjacent to the original word
and not in the initial or sentence-final position.
Any other degradation method could also be used,
so long as it has a high probability of reducing the
fluency of the text, and provided that it is not im-
mediately obvious to the judges.

Insertion of ask again and bad reference pairs
into the HITs allowed two measurements to be
made for each worker: when presented with
an ask again pair, we expect a conscientious
judge to give similar scores (but when using
a continuous scale, certainly not identical), and
on bad reference pairings a conscientious judge
should reliably give the altered sentence a lower
score. The wide separation of the two appear-
ances of an ask again pair makes it unlikely that
a judge would remember either the sentence or
their first reaction to it, and backwards movement
through the sentences comprising each HIT was
not possible. In total, each HIT contained 100 sen-

ted against mean seconds per judgment.

tences, including 10 bad reference pairs, and 10
ask again pairs.

Figure 3 illustrates these two types of pairs,
presuming that over the course of one or more
HITs each worker has assessed multiple ask again
pairs generating the distribution indicated by d1,
and also multiple bad reference pairs, generating
the distribution indicated by d2. As an estimate
of the reliability of each individual judge we ap-
ply a t-test to compare ask again differences with
bad reference differences, with the expectation
that for a conscientious worker the latter should
be larger than the former. Since there is no guar-
antee that the two distributions of d1 and d2 have
the same variance, we apply Welch’s adaptation of
the Student t-test.

The null hypothesis to be tested for each AMT
worker is that the score difference for ask again
pairs is not less than the score difference for
bad reference pairs. Lower p values mean more
reliable workers; in the experiments that are re-
ported shortly, we use p < 0.05 as a threshold
of reliability. We also applied the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney test to the same data, for the pur-
pose of comparison, since there is no guarantee
that d1 and d2 will be normally distributed for a
given assessor.

The next section provides details of the experi-
mental structure, and then describes the outcomes
in terms of their effect on overall system rank-
ings. As a preliminary indication of Turker be-

havior, Figure 4 summarizes some of the data that
was obtained. Each plotted point represents one
AMT worker who took part in our experiments,
and the horizontal axis reflects their average per-
judgment time (noting that this is an imprecise
measurement, since they may have taken phone
calls or answered email while working through a
HIT, or simply left the task idle to help obscure
a lack of effort). The vertical scale is the p value
obtained for that worker when the ask again distri-
bution is compared to their bad reference distribu-
tion, with a line at p = 0.05 indicating the upper
limit of the zone for which we are confident that
they had a different overall response to ask again
pairs than they did to bad reference pairs. Note the
small number of very fast, very inaccurate work-
ers at the top left; we have no hesitation in call-
ing them unconscientious (and declining to pay
them for their completed HITs). Note also the very
small number of workers for which it was possi-
ble to reliably distinguish their ask again behavior
from their bad reference behavior.

6 Experiments

HIT Structure
A sample of 560 translations was selected at
random from the WMT 2012 published shared
task dataset for a range of language pairs, with
segments consisting of 70 translations, each as-
signed to a total of eight distinct HITs. The sen-
tences were generated as image files, as recom-
mended for judgment of translations (Callison-
Burch, 2009). Each HIT was presented to a worker
as a set of 100 sentences including a total of 30
quality control items, with only one sentence visi-
ble on-screen at any given time. Each quality con-
trol item comprised a pair of corresponding trans-
lations, widely separated within the HIT. Three
kinds of quality control pairs were used:

• ask again: system output and exact repeat;
• bad reference: system output and an altered

version of it with noticeably lower fluency;
and

• good reference: system output and the corre-
sponding human produced reference transla-
tion (as provided in the released WMT data).

Each HIT consisted of 10 groups, each containing
10 sentences: 7 “normal” translations, plus one
of each type of quality control translation drawn

37



from one of the other groups in the HIT in such
a way that 40–60 judgments would be completed
between the elements of any quality-control pair.

Consistency of Human Judgments
Using judgments collected on the continuous rat-
ing scale, we first examine assessor consistency
based on Welch’s t-test and the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney U-test. In order to examine the de-
gree to which human assessors assign consistent
scores, we compute mean values of d1 (Figure 3)
when ask again pairs are given to the same judge,
and across pairs of judges. Three sets of results
are shown: the raw unfiltered data; data filtered
according to p < 0.05 according to the quality-
control regime described in the previous section
using the Welch’s t-test; and data filtered using
the Mann-Whitney U-test. Table 1 shows that the
t-test indicates that only 13.1% of assessors meet
quality control hurdle, while a higher proportion,
35.7%, of assessors are deemed acceptable.

The stricter filter, Welch’s t-test, yields more
consistent scores for same-judge repeat items: de-
creases of 4.5 (mean) and 4.2 (sd) are observed
when quality control is applied. In addition, re-
sults for Welch’s t-test show high levels of con-
sistency for same-judge repeat items: an average
difference of only 9.5 is observed, which is not
unreasonable, given that the scale is 100 points
in length and a 10-point difference corresponds to
just 60 pixels on the screen.

For repeat items rated by distinct judges, both
filtering methods decrease the mean difference in
scores compared to the unfiltered baseline, with
the two tests giving similar improvements.

When an interval-level scale is used to evaluate
the data, the Kappa coefficient is commonly used
to evaluate consistency levels of human judges
(Callison-Burch et al., 2007), where Pr(a) is the
relative observed agreement among raters, and
Pr(e) is the hypothetical probability of chance
agreement:

κ =
Pr(a)− Pr(e)

1− Pr(e)

In order to use the Kappa coefficient to compare
agreement levels for the interval-level and contin-
uous scales, we convert continuous scale scores to
a target number of interval categories. We do this
primarily for a target number of five, as this best
provides a comparison between scores for the 5-
point interval-level scale. But we also present re-

sults for targets of four and two categories, since
the continuous scale is marked at the midway and
quarter points, providing implicit intervals. A two-
category is also interesting if the assessment pro-
cess is regarded as dichotomizing to only include
for each translation whether or not the judge con-
sidered it to be “good” or “bad”. Use of statisti-
cal difference of means tests on interval-level data
is not recommended; but for the purpose of illus-
tration, we also applied Welch’s t-test to quality
control workers that completed the interval-level
HITs, with the same threshold of p < 0.05.

Tables 2 and 3 show intra-annotator agreement
for the five-point interval scale and continuous
scales, with and without quality control.2 Results
for repeat items on the interval-level scale show
that quality control only alters intra-aa marginally
(Pr(a) increases by 1%), and that inter-aa levels
worsen (Pr(a) decreases by 6.2%). This confirms
that applying statistical tests to interval-level data
is not a suitable way of filtering out low quality
workers.

When comparing consistency levels of asses-
sors using the interval-level scale to those of the
continuous scale, we observe marginally lower κ
coefficients for both intra-aa (−0.009) and inter-
aa (−0.041) for the continuous scale. However,
this is likely to be in part due to the fact that the
continuous scale corresponds more intuitively to 4
categories, and agreement levels for the unfiltered
4-category continuous scale are higher than those
collected on the interval-level scale by +0.023
intra-aa and +0.014 inter-aa.

Applying quality-control on the continuous
scale results in dramatic increases in intra-aa lev-
els: +0.152 for 5-categories (5-cat), +0.100 for
4-categories (4-cat) and +0.096 for 2-categories
(2-cat). When considering inter-aa levels, quality-
control does not directly result in as dramatic an
increase, as inter-aa levels increase by +0.010
for 5-cat, +0.006 for 4-cat and +0.004 for 2-cat.
It is likely, however, that apparent disagreement
between assessors might be due to different as-
sessors judging fluency generally worse or better
than one another. The continuous scale allows for
scores to be standardized by normalizing scores
with respect to the mean and standard deviation
of all scores assigned by a given individual judge.
We therefore transform scores of each judge into

gories was not applied for quality control.

combined set of all scores to map z-scores to cat-
egories where a score falling in the bottom 20 th
percentile corresponds to strongly disagree, scores
between the 20 th and 40 th percentile to disagree,
and so on. Although this method of transformation
is somewhat harsh on the continuous scale, since
scores no longer correspond to different locations
on the original scale, it nevertheless shows an in-
crease in consistency of +0.05 (5-cat), +0.086 (4-
cat) and +0.144 (2-cat). However, caution must
be taken when interpreting consistency for stan-
dardized scores, as can be seen from the increase
in agreement observed when unfiltered scores are
standardized.

Table 4 shows a breakdown by target language
of the proportion of judgments collected whose
scores met the significance threshold of p < 0.05.
Results appear at first to have shockingly low lev-
els of high quality work, especially for English and
German. When running the tasks in Mechanical
Turk, it is worth noting that we did not adopt statis-
tical tests to automatically accept/reject HITs and
we believe this would be rather harsh on workers.
Our method of quality control is a high bar to reach
and it is likely that many workers that do not meet
the significance threshold would still have been
working in good faith. In practice, we individually
examined mean scores for reference translation,
system outputs and bad reference pairs, and only
declined payment when there was no doubt the re-

sponse was either automatic or extremely careless.
The structure of the task and the fact that the

quality-control items were somewhat hidden may
have lulled workers into a false sense of compla-
cency, and perhaps encouraged careless responses.
However, even taking this into consideration, the
fact that none of the German speaking asses-
sors and just 10% of English speaking assessors
reached our standards serves to highlight the im-
portance of good quality-control techniques when
employing services like AMT. In addition, the risk
of getting low quality work for some languages
might be more risky than for others. The response
rate for high quality work for Spanish and French
was so much higher than German and English,
perhaps by chance, or perhaps the result of factors
that will be revealed in future experimentation.

System Rankings
As an example of the degree to which system
rankings are affected by applying quality control,
for the language direction for which we achieved
the highest number of high quality assessments,
English-to-Spanish, we include system rankings
by mean score with each measurement scale, with
and without quality control and for mean z-scores

Table 5: WMT system rankings based on approximately 80 randomly-selected fluency judgments per
system, with and without quality control for radio button and continuous input types, based on German-
English. The quality control method applied is annotators who score worsened system output and gen-
uine system outputs with statistically significant lower scores according to paired Student’s t-test.

when raw scores are normalized by individual as-
sessor mean and standard deviation. The results
are shown in Table 5. (Note that we do not claim
that these rankings are indicative of actual system
rankings, as only fluency of translations was as-
sessed, using an average of just 55 translations per
system.)

When comparing system rankings for unfiltered
versus quality-controlled continuous scales, firstly
the overall difference in ranking is not as dramatic
as one might expect, as many systems retain the
same rank order, with only a small number of sys-
tems changing position. This happens because
random-clickers cannot systematically favor any
system, and positive and negative random scores
tend to cancel each other out. However, even hav-
ing two systems ordered incorrectly is of concern;
careful quality control, and the use of normaliza-
tion of assessors’ scores may lead to more consis-
tent outcomes. We also note that incorrect system
orderings may lead to flow-on effects for evalua-
tion of automatic metrics.

The system rankings in Table 5 also show how

the use of the continuous scale can be used to rank
systems according to z-scores, so that individual
assessor preferences over judgments can be ame-
liorated. Interestingly, the system that scores clos-
est to the mean, Sys F, corresponds to the baseline
system for the shared task with a z-score of 0.01.

7 Conclusion

We have compared human assessor consistency
levels for judgments collected on a five-point
interval-level scale to those collected on a contin-
uous scale, using machine translation fluency as
a test case. We described a method for quality-
controlling crowd-sourced annotations that results
in marked increases in intra-annotator consistency
and does not require judges to agree with experts.
In addition, the use of a continuous scale allows
scores to be standardized to eliminate individual
judge preferences, resulting in higher levels of
inter-annotator consistency.
