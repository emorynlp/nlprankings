Abstract

One of the reasons for which the resolution
of coreferences has remained a challenging
information extraction task, especially in the
biomedical domain, is the lack of training
data in the form of annotated corpora. In or-
der to address this issue, we developed the
HANAPIN corpus. It consists of full-text ar-
ticles from biochemistry literature, covering
entities of several semantic types: chemical
compounds, drug targets (e.g., proteins, en-
zymes, cell lines, pathogens), diseases, or-
ganisms and drug effects. All of the co-
referring expressions pertaining to these se-
mantic types were annotated based on the an-
notation scheme that we developed. We ob-
served four general types of coreferences in
the corpus: sortal, pronominal, abbreviation
and numerical. Using the MASI distance
metric, we obtained 84% in computing the
inter-annotator agreement in terms of Krip-
pendorff’s alpha. Consisting of 20 full-text,
open-access articles, the corpus will enable
other researchers to use it as a resource for
their own coreference resolution methodolo-
gies.

1 Introduction

Coreferences are linguistic expressions referring to
the same real-world entity (Jurafsky and Martin,
2009). The process of grouping all co-referring ex-
pressions in text into respective coreference chains is
known as coreference resolution. It was introduced
as one of the tasks of the sixth Message Understand-
ing Conference (MUC-6) in 1995 (Grishman and

Sundheim, 1995) and is one of the information ex-
traction tasks which have remained a challenge to
this day. One of the reasons it is still considered
an unresolved problem especially in the biomedical
domain is the lack of coreference-annotated corpora
which are needed for developing coreference resolu-
tion systems.

There exist only a handful of biomedical corpora
which are annotated with coreference information.
We have conducted a review of each of them, tak-
ing into consideration their sizes, document compo-
sition, domain, types of markable entities, types of
coreference annotated, availability, and reliability in
terms of inter-annotator agreement. Of these, only
two corpora have been used in coreference resolu-
tion systems developed outside the research group
that annotated them: MEDSTRACT (Castano et al.,
2002), and the MEDCo1 corpus of abstracts which
was used by the different teams who participated
in the Coreference Supporting Task of the BioNLP
2011 Shared Task2. These two corpora are widely
used, despite the fact that they are composed only of
abstracts.

Previous studies have shown the advantages of
utilising full-text articles rather than abstracts in
information extraction systems (Shah et al., 2003;
Schumie et al., 2004; Cohen et al., 2010a). Further-
more, recent research on fact extraction (McIntosh
and Curran, 2009) has demonstrated the need for
processing full-text articles when identifying coref-
erent expressions pertaining to biomedical entities.

However, coreference-annotated corpora composed
of full-text articles are not readily accessible. Cur-
rently, only the FlySlip corpus (Gasperin et al.,
2007) is available for download. In this corpus,
only gene-related entities were considered for coref-
erence annotation. Thus, there is a need for devel-
oping full-text corpora with coreference annotations
for more semantic types. This is currently being ad-
dressed by the CRAFT project (Cohen et al., 2010b)
which seeks to develop a corpus of full-text articles
with coreference annotations for more types of en-
tities; it was not explicitly stated, however, exactly
which types are being covered. Similarly, we are
developing a corpus of full-text articles with corefer-
ence annotations, but to further the aim of covering
as many semantic types as possible, we selected a
domain that covers a variety of semantic concepts.
Research literature from this biochemistry subdo-
main, marine natural products chemistry, contains
references pertaining to chemical compounds, or-
ganisms, drug targets such as proteins, enzymes, nu-
cleic acids, tissues, cells, cell components, cell lines
and pathogens, drug effects, as well as diseases. We
cover a number of entity types with the intention of
providing more insight into how to disambiguate co-
referring expressions of different semantic types.

An annotation scheme was developed, taking into
consideration the coreference types which have been
observed from the corpus, namely: sortal, pronom-
inal, numerical and abbreviation. Three chemistry
graduates were employed to annotate the corpus. To
determine the reliability of the resulting annotations,
we measured inter-annotator agreement in terms of
Krippendorff’s alpha.

2 Related Work

Coreference is often associated with the phe-
nomenon of anaphora which is characterised by
an expression (called an anaphor) that points back
to an entity previously mentioned in the same dis-
course (called antecedent). Anaphora resolution
is the process of determining the antecedent of an
anaphor. While the output of anaphora resolution
is a set of anaphor-antecedent pairs, that of corefer-
ence resolution is a set of coreference chains which
can be treated as equivalence classes. Despite this
difference, an overlap between them may be ob-

served in several cases. Often, a number of anaphor-
antecedent pairs from a discourse are coreferential
or refer to the same entity in the same domain,
and may be placed in the same coreference chain.
For this reason, we also included in our review
of biomedical corpora those which were annotated
with anaphora information and refer to them hence-
forth as coreference-annotated corpora.

We determined the types of coreference anno-
tated in each corpus we have reviewed, adapting
Mitkov’s classification of anaphora (Mitkov et al.,
2000) which is also applicable to coreference. Nom-
inal coreference is characterised by co-referring ex-
pressions pertaining to a noun. It is further divided
into pronominal coreference and sortal coreference
which use a pronoun and a lexical noun phrase,
respectively, as co-referring expressions. Unlike
nominal coreference, verbal coreference is char-
acterised by co-referring expressions pertaining to
verbs. Both nominal and verbal coreference can
be broadly categorised according to the kind of
relation as direct or indirect. In direct corefer-
ence, co-referring expressions are related by iden-
tity, synonymy or specialisation; in indirect corefer-
ence, they are related by associative relations such as
meronymy or holonymy for nouns, and troponymy
or entailment for verbs. Annotation of indirect
coreference is usually more challenging as it re-
quires more specialised domain knowledge.

Presently, there are five (5) different biomedical
corpora which are annotated with coreference in-
formation: MEDSTRACT (Castano et al., 2002),
MEDCo3, FlySlip (Gasperin et al., 2007), the Col-
orado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) cor-
pus (Cohen et al., 2010b) and DrugNerAr (Segura-
Bedmar et al., 2009).

The MEDCo corpus has two subsets, one consist-
ing of abstracts (which we shall refer to as MEDCo-
A) and another consisting of full papers (MEDCo-
B). The results of our review of all five corpora
are presented in Table 1. Included in the last row
(HANAPIN) are the attributes of the corpus that we
have developed for comparison with existing cor-
pora.

Three of them, MEDSTRACT, MEDCo and
DrugNerAr, adapted an annotation scheme similar

to that of the Message Understanding Conference
scheme or MUCCS (Hirschman, 1997). Using the
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) as
annotation format, MUCCS creates a link between
co-referring expressions by setting the value of an
attribute of the referring element to the ID of the ref-
erent.

The same mechanism is used in the annotation
of MEDSTRACT, MEDCo and DrugNerAr, but
with respective extensions to account for more spe-
cific relations (e.g., appositive relation in the case
of MEDCo). On the contrary, rather than link-
ing the referring expression to its referent, an an-
notator explicitly places co-referring expressions in
the same coreference chain with OntoNotes, the
scheme adapted in annotating the CRAFT corpus.
FlySlip can be considered unique in terms of its
annotation scheme as it adapted a domain-specific
scheme which was necessary since indirect corefer-
ences were annotated. All corpora are available in
the form of a mark-up language (SGML or XML).

The five corpora can be grouped into three accord-
ing to general domain: molecular biology (MED-
STRACT and MEDCo), genomics (FlySlip and
CRAFT), and pharmacology (DrugNerAr). MED-
STRACT and MEDCo both have coreference an-
notations for semantic types from the UMLS and
the GENIA ontology, respectively, which can be
broadly categorised into compound, organism, pro-
tein, gene and cell. Each of the FlySlip and
DrugNerAr corpora, on the other hand, have anno-
tations for only one general semantic type: gene-
related entities and drugs, respectively. CRAFT is
unique in this respect as its developers seek to anno-
tate all co-referring expressions regardless of seman-
tic type; the semantic types that have been encoun-
tered so far have not yet been reported, however.

In terms of coreference types for which annota-
tions have been added, CRAFT is the only corpus
with annotations for verbal coreference; all the rest
have annotations only for pronominal and/or sortal
coreference. With respect to coreference types ac-
cording to relation, FlySlip is the only corpus with
annotations for indirect coreference.

MEDCo-B, FlySlip and CRAFT are three exist-
ing corpora which are comprised of full-text arti-
cles. Among them, only FlySlip is currently publicly
available.

The corpus that we have developed, which we call
the HANAPIN corpus, is also intended for public
release in the near future and covers five general
semantic types. In the annotation scheme which
was designed and used in HANAPIN, two addi-
tional coreference types were considered: abbrevi-
ations and numerical coreferences which are com-
monly used in chemistry research literature. These
coreference types and the annotation scheme are fur-
ther described in the succeeding section.

3 Methodology

3.1 Composition of Corpus Documents

Taking into consideration that the corpus should
consist of full-text articles which can be distributed
to the public, we gathered full-text articles from the
journal Marine Drugs4 which is under the PubMed
Central Open Access subset5. The said journal cov-
ers subject areas such as marine natural products,
medicine analysis, marine pharmacology, pharma-
ceutical biology, marine drugs development and ma-
rine biotechnology, among many others. From all
of its articles from 2003 to 2009, we randomly se-
lected twenty (20) which seemed to be a reason-
able size considering that only five months were al-
located for the annotation of the corpus, and that
a previous study on biomedical corpora (Cohen et
al., 2005) has shown that a corpus can possibly be
widely used despite its small size. The experimen-
tal sections of the articles were not annotated as
they contain very detailed descriptions of the meth-
ods carried out by the authors; according to a study
(Shah et al., 2003), these usually contain technical
data, instruments and measurements – types of in-
formation which are currently not of much interest
to researchers doing biomedical information extrac-
tion, although they may be in the future. The corpus
contains a total of 1,027 sentences or 27, 358 words.

3.2 Coreference Types

The coreferences observed in the corpus were cat-
egorised into four general nominal types: pronom-
inal, sortal, numerical and abbreviation. Table 2
presents the subtypes of sortal and pronominal
coreference, as well as examples for all types. We

have decided not to take into account verbal and in-
direct coreferences; only nominal and direct coref-
erences have been considered for the first release of
the corpus.

3.2.1 Pronominal Coreference
This type of coreference is characterised by a pro-

noun referring to a noun phrase. The pronoun is used
as a substitute to a noun. We have further identified
the following subtypes of pronominal coreference:
demonstrative, personal, indefinite, distributive and
relative.

3.2.2 Sortal Coreference
Also referred to as lexical noun phrase corefer-

ence, sortal coreference is characterised by a noun
phrase consisting of a head noun and its modifiers.
The subtypes of sortal coreference which have been
identified include: definite, indefinite, demonstra-
tive, distributive, predicate nominative and apposi-
tive.

3.2.3 Numerical Coreference
In chemistry research literature, a number is con-

ventionally used to refer to a chemical entity which
was introduced using the same number. Oftentimes,
a range of numbers is also used to refer to a number
of compounds previously mentioned.

3.2.4 Abbreviation
In annotating the HANAPIN corpus, abbrevia-

tions were also considered as co-referring expres-
sions. We distinguish them from the other corefer-
ence types to make the corpus of benefit to develop-
ers of abbreviation identification algorithms as well.

3.3 Annotation Scheme and Procedure

The annotation scheme used in MEDCo (which was
based on MUCCS) was adapted and modified for
the annotation of the HANAPIN corpus. We have
selected the MEDCo scheme as it already differen-
tiates between the pronominal and identity (equiva-
lent to sortal) types, whereas MUCCS has only the
identity type. There was a need, however, to extend
the MEDCo scheme to further specialise the corefer-
ence types. The XML Concordancer (XConc) tool6

was used in annotating the corpus. Configuring the
said tool for our needs is straightforward as it only
involved the customisation of a Document Type Def-
inition (DTD) file.

3.3.1 Term Annotations
As a preliminary step, the scheme required that

all terms which can be categorised into any of the

page=XConc+Suite

Figure 1: Sample annotations as shown in the XConc annotation tool. The sentences in this example come from one
of the documents in the HANAPIN corpus, the Marine Drugs article with PubMed ID 19841723. For illustrative
purposes, the first sentence in the example was slightly modified to demonstrate the use of the cons element.

following semantic types be annotated:

1. chemical compound

2. organism

3. drug effect

4. disease

5. drug target (further categorised into: protein,
enzyme, nucleic acid, tissue, cell, cell compo-
nent, cell line, pathogen)

For each markable, the annotator creates a term
element which is assigned an ID and one of the se-
mantic types above. The scheme supports the anno-
tation of embedded terms, as well as terms in a dis-
continuous text region. The former entails placing
a term element within another. The latter is done
by dividing the discontinuous text into fragments
and annotating each fragment in the same manner
as an ordinary term element. The fragment elements
are then grouped together as a constituent element
(cons). Figure 1 presents a sample annotation of
a discontinuous term (constituent C5) as viewed in
XConc.

3.3.2 Co-referring Expressions
An annotator proceeds to the annotation of co-

referring expressions after annotating all terms
within a document. If an expression was found to
be co-referring with another term, the annotator as-
signs the ID of the latter as the value of the idref
attribute of the former. If the referring expression,
however, is a noun phrase and not a term that was
previously annotated during term annotation, it is
marked as a ref element and then linked to its ref-
erent. Annotators delimit these expressions by in-
cluding the necessary modifiers of the co-referring

element (e.g., the new jaspamide derivatives instead
of just jaspamide derivatives). A coreference type
which could be any of pronominal, numerical, ab-
breviation, and sortal (further categorised into def-
inite, indefinite, demonstrative, distributive, predi-
cate nominative and appositive) is also assigned as
the value of the type attribute of each link created.
We decided not to further divide pronominal coref-
erence into its subtypes as it became apparent dur-
ing the annotation dry runs that there is only a hand-
ful of pronominal coreferences. Figure 1 shows co-
referring expressions (connected by arrows) linked
by the mechanism just described.

Listed below are some of the main points of the
annotation guidelines:

1. A referring expression may be linked to multi-
ple referents.

2. The more specific one between two co-
referring expressions is considered as the ref-
erent. This means that there might be cases
when the referent occurs later than the refer-
ring expression. For example, R30:the new
natural products is the co-referring ex-
pression and C5:jaspamide Q and R is
the referent in Figure 1.

3. In cases where there are multiple choices for
the referent of a referring expression, the clos-
est one may be chosen as long as it is (or will
be) linked to the other choice expressions.

4. There are cases when more than one type of
coreference applies. For example, in Figure 1,
the new natural products is both an appositive
and a definite noun phrase. In such cases, the
appositive and predicate nominative types take
precedence over the other sortal types.

88



Figure 2: XML code generated by XConc for the sample annotations in Figure 1.

One could process the XML code (provided in
Figure 2 for the reader’s reference) to obtain the fol-
lowing coreference chains:

1. {R30:the new natural products,
C5:jaspamide Q and R, R10:the
new jaspamide derivatives,
R11:which, R12:both}

2. {T66:jaspamide Q, R34:2}

3. {T67:jaspamide R, R35:3}

4. {T70:jaspamide, R36:1}

The complete annotation guidelines will be pub-
licly released together with the annotated corpus.

4 Results

The three annotators were asked to complete the
coreference annotations within five months. A bi-
weekly meeting was held to address questions and
issues which could not be addressed or resolved by
means of the online project forum.

4.1 Statistics
As the HANAPIN corpus is the first of its kind from
the biochemistry domain and aims to cover several
semantic as well as coreference types, it is of interest

to determine which of the types are most prevalent.
To do this we computed statistics over the annota-
tions (Figure 3). For each type, we obtained the av-
erage over the annotations from the three coders.

There is a total of 395 coreference chains (not
including singleton chains or those with only one
mention) in the entire corpus. The coreference
chains are of the following semantic types: chemical
compounds (70.89%), drug targets (12.66% that ac-
counts for proteins, cell lines, pathogens, enzymes,
cells, cell parts, nucleic acids and tissues), organ-
isms (9.87%), drug effects (3.29%), and diseases
(3.29%). Among the drug targets, the most preva-
lent are proteins, cell lines and pathogens.

A total of 760 coreference links have been found
in the corpus. The most common among the types
is the numerical one (46%), followed by the sortal
type (33% that accounts for the definite, indefinite,
demonstrative, appositive, predicate nominative and
distributive types). Less common are the pronomi-
nal type (11%) and abbreviation (10%). Among the
sortal coreferences, the most common are the def-
inite and indefinite types, followed by the demon-
strative type.

4.2 Corpus Reliability

Following Passoneau’s proposed method for com-
puting reliability for coreference annotation (Pas-
soneau, 2004), we computed for the reliability of
the corpus in terms of Krippendorff’s alpha, a co-
efficient of agreement that allows for partial dis-
agreement with the use of a distance metric based
on the similarity between coreference chains. Pas-
soneau’s first proposed distance metric (dP ) assigns
0 for identity, 0.33 for subsumption, 0.67 for inter-
section and 1 for disjunction. There are, however,
alternative distance metrics that consider the sizes
of the coreference chains, such as Jaccard’s coeffi-
cient of community (dJ ) and Dice’s coincidence in-
dex (dD) which can be computed as follows (Art-
stein and Peosio, 2004):

dJ = 1−
|A ∩B|
|A ∪B|

dD = 1−
2|A ∩B|
|A|+ |B|

A new distance metric called Measuring Agree-
ment on Set-valued Items (MASI) was then later
proposed by Passoneau. It is obtained by getting the
product of the original distance metric dP and Jac-
card’s coefficient dJ .

Initially using Passoneau’s first proposed distance
metric dP in computing for Krippendorff’s alpha,
we obtained an average of 75% over all documents
in the HANAPIN corpus. Computing for alpha us-
ing the MASI distance metric gives 84%. Though

there is no value of alpha that has been established
to be an absolute indication of high agreement, pre-
vious works cited by Krippendorff have shown that
values of alpha less than 67% indicate unreliability
(Krippendorff, 1980). We can therefore regard the
obtained values of alpha as satisfactory.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

A coreference-annotated corpus from the domain
of biochemistry, consisting of full-text articles, has
been developed. It was annotated following guide-
lines which covered coreference and semantic types
that have not been covered in other biomedical cor-
pora before. This was done to further the aim of pro-
viding researchers with more insight into the phe-
nomenon of coreference in a cross-disciplinary do-
main. Results show that in this biochemistry do-
main, the most common types of coreference being
used by authors are the numerical and sortal types.
Verbal and indirect coreferences, however, have not
been considered at this stage; the annotation of these
types can be explored as part of future work on the
corpus.

To measure reliability of the corpus, we deter-
mined inter-annotator agreement on all documents
by computing for the value of Krippendorff’s al-
pha. Using Passoneau’s first proposed distance met-
ric and the MASI distance metric, we obtained sat-
isfactory values of 75% and 84%, respectively. The
corpus and annotation guidelines will be released to
the public to encourage and enable more researchers
to develop improved biomedical coreference resolu-
