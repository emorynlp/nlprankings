Abstract
Many models in natural language process-
ing define probabilistic distributions over
linguistic structures. We argue that (1)
the quality of a model’s posterior distribu-
tion can and should be directly evaluated,
as to whether probabilities correspond to
empirical frequencies; and (2) NLP uncer-
tainty can be projected not only to pipeline
components, but also to exploratory data
analysis, telling a user when to trust and
not trust the NLP analysis. We present a
method to analyze calibration, and apply
it to compare the miscalibration of sev-
eral commonly used models. We also con-
tribute a coreference sampling algorithm
that can create confidence intervals for a
political event extraction task.1

1 Introduction

Natural language processing systems are imper-
fect. Decades of research have yielded analyzers
that mis-identify named entities, mis-attach syn-
tactic relations, and mis-recognize noun phrase
coreference anywhere from 10-40% of the time.
But these systems are accurate enough so that their
outputs can be used as soft, if noisy, indicators of
language meaning for use in downstream analysis,
such as systems that perform question answering,
machine translation, event extraction, and narra-
tive analysis (McCord et al., 2012; Gimpel and
Smith, 2008; Miwa et al., 2010; Bamman et al.,
2013).

To understand the performance of an ana-
lyzer, researchers and practitioners typically mea-
sure the accuracy of individual labels or edges
among a single predicted output structure y, such
as a most-probable tagging or entity clustering
arg maxy P (y|x) (conditional on text data x).

pendix, and acknowledgments sections:

But a probabilistic model gives a probability
distribution over many other output structures that
have smaller predicted probabilities; a line of work
has sought to control cascading pipeline errors by
passing on multiple structures from earlier stages
of analysis, by propagating prediction uncertainty
through multiple samples (Finkel et al., 2006),
K-best lists (Venugopal et al., 2008; Toutanova
et al., 2008), or explicitly diverse lists (Gimpel
et al., 2013); often the goal is to marginalize over
structures to calculate and minimize an expected
loss function, as in minimum Bayes risk decod-
ing (Goodman, 1996; Kumar and Byrne, 2004), or
to perform joint inference between early and later
stages of NLP analysis (e.g. Singh et al., 2013;
Durrett and Klein, 2014).

These approaches should work better when the
posterior probabilities of the predicted linguistic
structures reflect actual probabilities of the struc-
tures or aspects of the structures. For example, say
a model is overconfident: it places too much prob-
ability mass in the top prediction, and not enough
in the rest. Then there will be little benefit to us-
ing the lower probability structures, since in the
training or inference objectives they will be incor-
rectly outweighed by the top prediction (or in a
sampling approach, they will be systematically un-
dersampled and thus have too-low frequencies). If
we only evaluate models based on their top pre-
dictions or on downstream tasks, it is difficult to
diagnose this issue.

Instead, we propose to directly evaluate the cal-
ibration of a model’s posterior prediction distri-
bution. A perfectly calibrated model knows how
often it’s right or wrong; when it predicts an event
with 80% confidence, the event empirically turns
out to be true 80% of the time. While perfect
accuracy for NLP models remains an unsolved
challenge, perfect calibration is a more achievable
goal, since a model that has imperfect accuracy
could, in principle, be perfectly calibrated. In this
paper, we develop a method to empirically analyze
calibration that is appropriate for NLP models (§3)

1587



and use it to analyze common generative and dis-
criminative models for tagging and classification
(§4).

Furthermore, if a model’s probabilities are
meaningful, that would justify using its proba-
bility distributions for any downstream purpose,
including exploratory analysis on unlabeled data.
In §6 we introduce a representative corpus explo-
ration problem, identifying temporal event trends
in international politics, with a method that is de-
pendent on coreference resolution. We develop
a coreference sampling algorithm (§5.2) which
projects uncertainty into the event extraction, in-
ducing a posterior distribution over event frequen-
cies. Sometimes the event trends have very high
posterior variance (large confidence intervals),2

reflecting when the NLP system genuinely does
not know the correct semantic extraction. This
highlights an important use of a calibrated model:
being able to tell a user when the model’s predic-
tions are likely to be incorrect, or at least, not giv-
ing a user a false sense of certainty from an erro-
neous NLP analysis.

2 Definition of calibration

Consider a binary probabilistic prediction prob-
lem, which consists of binary labels and proba-
bilistic predictions for them. Each instance has a
ground-truth label y ∈ {0, 1}, which is used for
evaluation. The prediction problem is to gener-
ate a predicted probability or prediction strength
q ∈ [0, 1]. Typically, we use some form of a prob-
abilistic model to accomplish this task, where q
represents the model’s posterior probability3 of the
instance having a positive label (y = 1).

Let S = {(q1, y1), (q2, y2), · · · (qN , yN )} be
the set of prediction-label pairs produced by the
model. Many metrics assess the overall quality
of how well the predicted probabilities match the
data, such as the familiar cross entropy (negative
average log-likelihood),

L`(~y, ~q) =
1
N

∑
i

yi log
1
qi

+ (1− yi) log 11− qi
or mean squared error, also known as the Brier
score when y is binary (Brier, 1950),

L2(~y, ~q) =
1
N

∑
i

(yi − qi)2

2We use the terms confidence interval and credible inter-
val interchangeably in this work; the latter term is debatably
more correct, though less widely familiar.

3Whether q comes from a Bayesian posterior or not is ir-
relevant to the analysis in this section. All that matters is that
predictions are numbers q ∈ [0, 1].

Both tend to attain better (lower) values when q is
near 1 when y = 1, and near 0 when y = 0; and
they achieve a perfect value of 0 when all qi = yi.4

Let P(y, q) be the joint empirical distribution
over labels and predictions. Under this notation,
L2 = Eq,y[y − q]2. Consider the factorization

P(y, q) = P(y | q) P(q)
where P(y | q) denotes the label empirical fre-
quency, conditional on a prediction strength (Mur-
phy and Winkler, 1987).5 Applying this factor-
ization to the Brier score leads to the calibration-
refinement decomposition (DeGroot and Fienberg,
1983), in terms of expectations with respect to the
prediction strength distribution P(q):

L2 = Eq[q − pq]2︸ ︷︷ ︸
Calibration MSE

+ Eq[pq(1− pq)]︸ ︷︷ ︸
Refinement

(1)

where we denote pq ≡ P(y = 1 | q) for brevity.
Here, calibration measures to what extent a

model’s probabilistic predictions match their cor-
responding empirical frequencies. Perfect calibra-
tion is achieved when P(y = 1 | q) = q for all
q; intuitively, if you aggregate all instances where
a model predicted q, they should have y = 1 at q
percent of the time. We define the magnitude of
miscalibration using root mean squared error:
Definition 1 (RMS calibration error).

CalibErr =
√

Eq[q − P(y = 1 | q)]2

The second term of Eq 1 refers to refinement,
which reflects to what extent the model is able
to separate different labels (in terms of the con-
ditional Gini entropy pq(1 − pq)). If the predic-
tion strengths tend to cluster around 0 or 1, the re-
finement score tends to be lower. The calibration-
refinement breakdown offers a useful perspective
on the accuracy of a model posterior. This paper
focuses on calibration.

There are several other ways to break down
squared error, log-likelihood, and other probabilis-
tic scoring rules.6 We use the Brier-based calibra-
tion error in this work, since unlike cross-entropy

4These two loss functions are instances of proper scoring
rules (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007; Bröcker, 2009).

5 We alternatively refer to this as label frequency or empir-
ical frequency. The P probabilities can be thought of as fre-
quencies from the hypothetical population the data and pre-
dictions are drawn from. P probabilities are, definitionally
speaking, completely separate from a probabilistic model that
might be used to generate q predictions.

6They all include a notion of calibration corresponding to
a Bregman divergence (Bröcker, 2009); for example, cross-
entropy can be broken down such that KL divergence is the
measure of miscalibration.

Algorithm 1 Estimate calibration error using
adaptive binning.
Input: A set of N prediction-label pairs
{(q1, y1), (q2, y2), · · · , (qN , yN )}.
Output: Calibration error.
Parameter: Target bin size β.
Step 1: Sort pairs by prediction values qk in ascending order.

Step 2: For each, assign bin label bk =
⌊
k−1
β

⌋
+ 1.

Step 3: Define each bin Bi as the set of indices of pairs that
have the same bin label. If the last bin has size less than
β, merge it with the second-to-last bin (if one exists). Let
{B1, B2, · · · , BT } be the set of bins.
Step 4: Calculate empirical and predicted probabilities per
bin:

p̂i =
1

|Bi|
∑
k∈Bi

Step 5: Calculate the calibration error as the root mean
squared error per bin, weighted by bin size in case they are
not uniformly sized:

CalibErr =

√√√√ 1

T∑
i=1

|Bi|(q̂i − p̂i)2

it does not tend toward infinity when near prob-
ability 0; we hypothesize this could be an issue
since both p and q are subject to estimation error.

3 Empirical calibration analysis

From a test set of labeled data, we can analyze
model calibration both in terms of the calibration
error, as well as visualizing the calibration curve
of label frequency versus predicted strength. How-
ever, computing the label frequencies P(y = 1|q)
requires an infinite amount of data. Thus approx-
imation methods are required to perform calibra-
tion analysis.

3.1 Adaptive binning procedure

Previous studies that assess calibration in super-
vised machine learning models (Niculescu-Mizil
and Caruana, 2005; Bennett, 2000) calculate la-
bel frequencies by dividing the prediction space
into deciles or other evenly spaced bins—e.g. q ∈
[0, 0.1), q ∈ [0.1, 0.2), etc.—and then calculat-
ing the empirical label frequency in each bin. This
procedure may be thought of as using a form of
nonparametric regression (specifically, a regres-
sogram; Tukey 1961) to estimate the function
f(q) = P(y = 1 | q) from observed data points.
But models in natural language processing give
very skewed distributions of confidence scores q
(many are near 0 or 1), so this procedure performs
poorly, having much more variable estimates near

Algorithm 2 Estimate calibration error’s confi-
dence interval by sampling.
Input: A set of N prediction-label pairs
{(q1, y1), (q2, y2), · · · , (qN , yN )}.
Output: Calibration error with a 95% confidence interval.
Parameter: Number of samples, S.
Step 1: Calculate {p̂1, p̂2, · · · , p̂T } from step 4 of Algo-
rithm 1.
Step 2: Draw S samples. For each s = 1..S,

• Calculate the sample’s CalibErr from using the pairs

Step 3: Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the calibra-
tion error as:

where CalibErravg and ŝerror are the mean and the stan-
dard deviation, respectively, of the CalibErrs calculated
from the samples.

the middle of the q distribution (Figure 1).
We propose adaptive binning as an alterna-

tive. Instead of dividing the interval [0, 1] into
fixed-width bins, adaptive binning defines the bins
such that there are an equal number of points
in each, after which the same averaging proce-
dure is used. This method naturally gives wider
bins to area with fewer data points (areas that re-
quire more smoothing), and ensures that these ar-
eas have roughly similar standard errors as those
near the boundaries, since for a bin with β num-
ber of points and empirical frequency p, the stan-
dard error is estimated by

√
p(1− p)/β, which is

bounded above by 0.5/
√
β. Algorithm 1 describes

the procedure for estimating calibration error us-
ing adaptive binning, which can be applied to any
probabilistic model that predicts posterior proba-
bilities.

3.2 Confidence interval estimation
Especially when the test set is small, estimating
calibration error may be subject to error, due to
uncertainty in the label frequency estimates. Since
how to estimate confidence bands for nonparamet-
ric regression is an unsolved problem (Wasserman,
2006), we resort to a simple method based on the
binning. We construct a binomial normal approx-
imation for the label frequency estimate in each
bin, and simulate from it; every simulation across
all bins is used to construct a calibration error;
these simulated calibration errors are collected to
construct a normal approximation for the calibra-

least β ≥ 200 in our experiments, the central limit
theorem justifies these approximations. We report
all calibration errors along with their 95% confi-
dence intervals calculated by Algorithm 2.7

3.3 Visualizing calibration
In order to better understand a model’s
calibration properties, we plot the pairs
(p̂1, q̂1), (p̂2, q̂2), · · · , (p̂T , q̂T ) obtained from
the adaptive binning procedure to visualize the
calibration curve of the model—this visualization
is known as a calibration or reliability plot. It
provides finer grained insight into the calibra-
tion behavior in different prediction ranges. A
perfectly calibrated curve would coincide with
the y = x diagonal line. When the curve lies
above the diagonal, the model is underconfident
(q < pq); and when it is below the diagonal, the
model is overconfident (q > pq).

An advantage of plotting a curve estimated from
fixed-size bins, instead of fixed-width bins, is that
the distribution of the points hints at the refinement
aspect of the model’s performance. If the points’
positions tend to cluster in the bottom-left and top-
right corners, that implies the model is making
more refined predictions.

4 Calibration for classification and
tagging models

Using the method described in §3, we assess the
quality of posterior predictions of several classi-
fication and tagging models. In all of our exper-

7A major unsolved issue is how to fairly select the bin
size. If it is too large, the curve is oversmoothed and calibra-
tion looks better than it should be; if it is too small, calibra-
tion looks worse than it should be. Bandwidth selection and
cross-validation techniques may better address this problem
in future work. In the meantime, visualizations of calibration
curves help inform the reader of the resolution of a particular
analysis—if the bins are far apart, the data is sparse, and the
specific details of the curve are not known in those regions.

iments, we set the target bin size in Algorithm 1
to be 5,000 and the number of samples in Algo-
rithm 2 to be 10,000.

4.1 Naive Bayes and logistic regression
4.1.1 Introduction
Previous work on Naive Bayes has found its prob-
abilities to have calibration issues, in part due
to its incorrect conditional independence assump-
tions (Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana, 2005; Ben-
nett, 2000; Domingos and Pazzani, 1997). Since
logistic regression has the same log-linear repre-
sentational capacity (Ng and Jordan, 2002) but
does not suffer from the independence assump-
tions, we select it for comparison, hypothesizing
it may have better calibration.

We analyze a binary classification task of Twit-
ter sentiment analysis from emoticons. We col-
lect a dataset consisting of tweets identified by the
Twitter API as English, collected from 2014 to
2015, with the “emoticon trick” (Read, 2005; Lin
and Kolcz, 2012) to label tweets that contain at
least one occurrence of the smiley emoticon “:)”
as “happy” (y = 1) and others as y = 0. The
smiley emoticons are deleted in positive examples.
We sampled three sets of tweets (subsampled from
the Decahose/Gardenhose stream of public tweets)
with Jan-Apr 2014 for training, May-Dec 2014 for
development, and Jan-Apr 2015 for testing. Each
set contains 105 tweets, split between an equal
number of positive and negative instances. We
use binary features based on unigrams extracted
from the twokenize.py8 tokenization. We use the
scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) implementa-
tions of Bernoulli Naive Bayes and L2-regularized
logistic regression. The models’ hyperparameters
(Naive Bayes’ smoothing paramter and logistic re-
gression’s regularization strength) are chosen to

4.1.2 Results
Naive Bayes attains a slightly higher F-1 score
(NB 73.8% vs. LR 72.9%), but logistic regression
has much lower calibration error: less than half
as much RMSE (NB 0.105 vs. LR 0.041; Figure
2). Both models have a tendency to be undercon-
fident in the lower prediction range and overconfi-
dent in the higher range, but the tendency is more
pronounced for Naive Bayes.

4.2 Hidden Markov models and conditional
random fields

4.2.1 Introduction
Hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear chain
conditional random fields (CRF) are another com-
monly used pair of analogous generative and dis-
criminative models. They both define a posterior
over tag sequences P (y|x), which we apply to
part-of-speech tagging.

We can analyze these models in the binary cal-
ibration framework (§2-3) by looking at marginal
distribution of binary-valued outcomes of parts of
the predicted structures. Specifically, we examine
calibration of predicted probabilities of individual
tokens’ tags (§4.2.2), and of pairs of consecutive
tags (§4.2.3). These quantities are calculated with
the forward-backward algorithm.

To prepare a POS tagging dataset, we ex-
tract Wall Street Journal articles from the En-
glish CoNLL-2011 coreference shared task dataset
from Ontonotes (Pradhan et al., 2011), using the
CoNLL-2011 splits for training, development and
testing. This results in 11,772 sentences for train-
ing, 1,632 for development, and 1,382 for testing,
over a set of 47 possible tags.

We train an HMM with Dirichlet MAP us-
ing one pseudocount for every transition and
word emission. For the CRF, we use the L2-
regularized L-BFGS algorithm implemented in

CRFsuite (Okazaki, 2007). We compare an HMM
to a CRF that only uses basic transition (tag-tag)
and emission (tag-word) features, so that it does
not have an advantage due to more features. In
order to compare models with similar task perfor-
mance, we train the CRF with only 3000 sentences
from the training set, which yields the same accu-
racy as the HMM (about 88.7% on the test set).
In each case, the model’s hyperparameters (the
CRF’s L2 regularizer, the HMM’s pseudocount)
are selected by maximizing accuracy on the devel-
opment set.

4.2.2 Predicting single-word tags

In this experiment, we measure miscalibration of
the two models on predicting tags of single words.
First, for each tag type, we produce a set of 33,306
prediction-label pairs (for every token); we then
concatenate them across the tags for calibration
analysis. Figure 3 shows that the two models
exhibit distinct calibration patterns. The HMM
tends to be very underconfident whereas the CRF
is overconfident, and the CRF has a lower (better)
overall calibration error.

We also examine the calibration errors of the
individual POS tags (Figure 4(a)). We find that
CRF is significantly better calibrated than HMM
in most but not all categories (39 out of 47). For
example, they are about equally calibrated on pre-
dicting the NN tag. The calibration gap between
the two models also differs among the tags.

4.2.3 Predicting two-consecutive-word tags

There is no reason to restrict ourselves to model
predictions of single words; these models define
marginal distributions over larger textual units.
Next we examine the calibration of posterior pre-
dictions of tag pairs on two consecutive words in
the test set. The same analysis may be impor-
tant for, say, phrase extraction or other chunk-
ing/parsing tasks.

Lower errors are better. The last two columns in each graph
are the average calibration errors over the most common la-
bels.

We report results for the top 5 and 100 most fre-
quent tag pairs (Figure 4(b)). We observe a simi-
lar pattern as seen from the experiment on single
tags: the CRF is generally better calibrated than
the HMM, but the HMM does achieve better cali-
bration errors in 29 out of 100 categories.

These tagging experiments illustrate that, de-
pending on the application, different models can
exhibit different levels of calibration.

5 Coreference resolution

We examine a third model, a probabilistic model
for within-document noun phrase coreference,
which has an efficient sampling-based inference
procedure. In this section we introduce it and ana-
lyze its calibration, in preparation for the next sec-
tion where we use it for exploratory data analysis.

5.1 Antecedent selection model

We use the Berkeley coreference resolution sys-
tem (Durrett and Klein, 2013), which was origi-
nally presented as a CRF; we give it an equivalent
a series of independent logistic regressions (see
appendix for details). The primary component of
this model is a locally-normalized log-linear dis-
tribution over clusterings of noun phrases, each
cluster denoting an entity. The model takes a fixed
input of N mentions (noun phrases), indexed by i
in their positional order in the document. It posits
that every mention i has a latent antecedent selec-
tion decision, ai ∈ {1, . . . , i− 1, NEW}, denoting

which previous mention it attaches to, or NEW if it
is starting a new entity that has not yet been seen
at a previous position in the text. Such a mention-
mention attachment indicates coreference, while
the final entity clustering includes more links im-
plied through transitivity. The model’s generative
process is:

Definition 2 (Antencedent coreference model and
sampling algorithm).

• For i = 1..N , sample
ai ∼ 1Zi exp(wTf(i, ai, x))
• Calculate the entity clusters as e := CC(a),

the connected components of the antecedent
graph having edges (i, ai) for i where ai 6=
NEW.

Here x denotes all information in the document
that is conditioned on for log-linear features f .
e = {e1, ...eM} denotes the entity clusters, where
each element is a set of mentions. There areM en-
tity clusters corresponding to the number of con-
nected components in a. The model defines a joint
distribution over antecedent decisions P (a|x) =∏

i P (ai|x); it also defines a joint distribution over
entity clusterings P (e|x), where the probability of
an e is the sum of the probabilities of all a vectors
that could give rise to it. In a manner similar to
a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process
(Blei and Frazier, 2011), it is non-parametric in the
sense that the number of clusters M is not fixed in
advance.

5.2 Sampling-based inference
For both calibration analysis and exploratory ap-
plications, we need to analyze the posterior distri-
bution over entity clusterings. This distribution is
a complex mathematical object; an attractive ap-
proach to analyze it is to draw samples from this
distribution, then analyze the samples.

This antecedent-based model admits a very
straightforward procedure to draw independent e
samples, by stepping through Def. 2: indepen-
dently sample each ai then calculate the connected
components of the resulting antecedent graph.
By construction, this procedure samples from the
joint distribution of e (even though we never com-
pute the probability of any single clustering e).

Unlike approximate sampling approaches, such
as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods used in
other coreference work to sample e (Haghighi and
Klein, 2007), here there are no questions about
burn-in or autocorrelation (Kass et al., 1998).
Every sample is independent and very fast to

compute—only slightly slower than calculating
the MAP assignment (due to the exp and normal-
ization for each ai). We implement this algorithm
by modifying the publicly available implementa-
tion from Durrett and Klein.9

5.3 Calibration analysis
We consider the following inference query: for a
randomly chosen pair of mentions, are they coref-
erent? Even if the model’s accuracy is compara-
tively low, it may be the case that it is correctly
calibrated—if it thinks there should be great vari-
ability in entity clusterings, it may be uncertain
whether a pair of mentions should belong together.

Let `ij be 1 if the mentions i and j are predicted
to be coreferent, and 0 otherwise. Annotated data
defines a gold-standard `(g)ij value for every pair
i, j. Any probability distribution over e defines a
marginal Bernoulli distribution for every proposi-
tion `ij , marginalizing out e:

P (`ij = 1 | x) =
∑
e

1{(i, j) ∈ e}P (e | x) (2)

where (i, j) ∈ e is true iff there is an entity in e
that contains both i and j.

In a traditional coreference evaluation of the
best-prediction entity clustering, the model as-
signs 1 or 0 to every `ij and the pairwise precision
and recall can be computed by comparing them to
the corresponding `(g)ij . Here, we instead compare
the qij ≡ P (`ij = 1 | x, e) prediction strengths
against `(g)ij empirical frequencies to assess pair-
wise calibration, with the same binary calibration
analysis tools developed in §3 by aggregating pairs
with similar qij values. Each qij is computed by
averaging over 1,000 samples, simply taking the
fraction of samples where the pair (i, j) is coref-
erent.

9Berkeley Coreference Resolution System, version
1.1: http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/
coref.shtml

We perform this analysis on the develop-
ment section of the English CoNLL-2011 data
(404 documents). Using the sampling inference
method discussed in §5.2, we compute 4.3 mil-
lions prediction-label pairs and measure their cali-
bration error. Our result shows that the model pro-
duces very well-calibrated predictions with less
than 1% CalibErr (Figure 5), though slightly
overconfident on middle to high-valued predic-
tions. The calibration error indicates that it is the
most calibrated model we examine within this pa-
per. This result suggests we might be able to trust
its level of uncertainty.

6 Uncertainty in Entity-based
Exploratory Analysis

6.1 Entity-syntactic event aggregation
We demonstrate one important use of calibration
analysis: to ensure the usefulness of propagating
uncertainty from coreference resolution into a sys-
tem for exploring unannotated text. Accuracy can-
not be calculated since there are no labels; but
if the system is calibrated, we postulate that un-
certainty information can help users understand
the underlying reliability of aggregated extractions
and isolate predictions that are more likely to con-
tain errors.

We illustrate with an event analysis application
to count the number of “country attack events”:
for a particular country of the world, how many
news articles describe an entity affiliated with that
country as the agent of an attack, and how does
this number change over time? This is a simpli-
fied version of a problem where such systems have
been built and used for political science analysis
(Schrodt et al., 1994; Schrodt, 2012; Leetaru and
Schrodt, 2013; Boschee et al., 2013; O’Connor
et al., 2013). A coreference component can im-
prove extraction coverage in cases such as “Rus-
sian troops were sighted . . . and they attacked . . . ”

We use the coreference system examined in §5
for this analysis. To propagate coreference un-
certainty, we re-run event extraction on multiple
coreference samples generated from the algorithm
described in §5.2, inducing a posterior distribution
over the event counts. To isolate the effects of
coreference, we use a very simple syntactic depen-
dency system to identify affiliations and events.
Assume the availability of dependency parses for
a document d, a coreference resolution e, and a
lexicon of country names, which contains a small
set of words w(c) for each country c; for example,
w(FRA) = {france, french}. The binary function

1593



f(c, e;xd) assesses whether an entity e is affiliated
with country c and is described as the agent of an
attack, based on document text and parses xd; f
returns true iff both:10

• There exists a mention i ∈ e described
as country c: either its head word is in
w(c) (e.g. “Americans”), or its head word
has an nmod or amod modifier in w(c)
(e.g. “American forces”, “president of the
U.S.”); and there is only one unique country
c among the mentions in the entity.

• There exists a mention j ∈ e which is the
nsubj or agent argument to the verb “attack”
(e.g. “they attacked”, “the forces attacked”,
“attacked by them”).

For a given c, we first calculate a binary variable
for whether there is at least one entity fulfilling f
in a particular document,

a(d, c, ed) =
∨

e∈ed
f(c, e;xd) (3)

and second, the number of such documents in d(t),
the set of New York Times articles published in a
given time period t,

n(t, c, ed(t)) =
∑

d∈d(t)
a(d, c, ed) (4)

These quantities are both random variables, since
they depend on e; thus we are interested in the
posterior distribution of n, marginalizing out e,

P (n(t, c, ed(t)) | xd(t)) (5)

If our coreference model was highly certain (only
one structure, or a small number of similar struc-
tures, had most of the probability mass in the space
of all possible structures), each document would
have an a posterior near either 0 or 1, and their
sum in Eq. 5 would have a narrow distribution. But
if the model is uncertain, the distribution will be
wider. Because of the transitive closure, the prob-
ability of a is potentially more complex than the
single antecedent linking probability between two
mentions—the affiliation and attack information
can propagate through a long coreference chain.

6.2 Results
We tag and parse a 193,403 article subset of the
Annotated New York Times LDC corpus (Sand-
haus, 2008), which includes articles about world

10Syntactic relations are Universal Dependencies

tion rules are in the appendix.

news from the years 1987 to 2007 (details in ap-
pendix). For each article, we run the coreference
system to predict 100 samples, and evaluate f on
every entity in every sample.11 The quantity of
interest is the number of articles mentioning at-
tacks in a 3-month period (quarter), for a given
country. Figure 6 illustrates the mean and 95%
posterior credible intervals for each quarter. The
posterior mean m is calculated as the mean of the
samples, and the interval is the normal approxima-
tion m± 1.96 s, where s is the standard deviation
among samples for that country and time period.

Uncertainty information helps us understand
whether a difference between data points is real.
In the plots of Figure 6, if we had used a 1-best
coreference resolution, only a single line would be
shown, with no assessment of uncertainty. This
is problematic in cases when the model genuinely
does not know the correct answer. For example,
the 1993-1996 period of the USA plot (Figure 6,
top) shows the posterior mean fluctuating from 1
to 5 documents; but when credible intervals are
taken into consideration, we see that model does
not know whether the differences are real, or were
caused by coreference noise.

A similar case is highlighted at the bottom plot
of Figure 6. Here we compare the event counts
for Yugoslavia and NATO, which were engaged in
a conflict in 1999. Did the New York Times de-
vote more attention to the attacks by one particu-
lar side? To a 1-best system, the answer would be
yes. But the posterior intervals for the two coun-
tries’ event counts in mid-1999 heavily overlap,
indicating that the coreference system introduces
too much uncertainty to obtain a conclusive an-
swer for this question. Note that calibration of the
coreference model is important for the credible in-
tervals to be useful; for example, if the model was
badly calibrated by being overconfident (too much
probability over a small set of similar structures),
these intervals would be too narrow, leading to in-
correct interpretations of the event dynamics.

Visualizing this uncertainty gives richer infor-
mation for a potential user of an NLP-based sys-
tem, compared to simply drawing a line based on
a single 1-best prediction. It preserves the gen-
uine uncertainty due to ambiguities the system was
unable to resolve. This highlights an alternative
use of Finkel et al. (2006)’s approach of sampling
multiple NLP pipeline components, which in that
work was used to perform joint inference. Instead

11We obtained similar results using only 10 samples. We
also obtained similar results with a different query function,
the total number of entities, across documents, that fulfill f .

1594



of focusing on improving an NLP pipeline, we can
pass uncertainty on to exploratory purposes, and
try to highlight to a user where the NLP system
may be wrong, or where it can only imprecisely
specify a quantity of interest.

Finally, calibration can help error analysis. For
a calibrated model, the more uncertain a predic-
tion is, the more likely it is to be erroneous. While
coreference errors comprise only one part of event
extraction errors (alongside issues in parse qual-
ity, factivity, semantic roles, etc.), we can look at
highly uncertain event predictions to understand
the nature of coreference errors relative to our
task. We manually analyzed documents with a
50% probability to contain an “attack”ing country-
affiliated entity, and found difficult coreference
cases.

In one article from late 1990, an “attack” event
for IRQ is extracted from the sentence “But some
political leaders said that they feared that Mr. Hus-
sein might attack Saudi Arabia”. The mention
“Mr. Hussein” is classified as IRQ only when it
is coreferent with a previous mention “President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq”; this occurs only 50%
of the time, since in some posterior samples the
coreference system split apart these two “Hussein”
mentions. This particular document is addition-
ally difficult, since it includes the names of more
than 10 countries (e.g. United States, Saudi Ara-
bia, Egypt), and some of the Hussein mentions are
even clustered with presidents of other countries
(such as “President Bush”), presumably because
they share the “president” title. These types of er-
rors are a major issue for a political analysis task;
further analysis could assess their prevalence and
how to address them in future work.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we argue that the calibration of pos-
terior predictions is a desirable property of prob-
abilistic NLP models, and that it can be directly
evaluated. We also demonstrate a use case of
having calibrated uncertainty: its propagation into
downstream exploratory analysis.

Our posterior simulation approach for ex-
ploratory and error analysis relates to posterior
predictive checking (Gelman et al., 2013), which
analyzes a posterior to test model assumptions;
Mimno and Blei (2011) apply it to a topic model.

One avenue of future work is to investigate
more effective nonparametric regression methods
to better estimate and visualize calibration error,
such as Gaussian processes or bootstrapped kernel

density estimation.
Another important question is: what types of in-

ferences are facilitated by correct calibration? In-
tuitively, we think that overconfidence will lead
to overly narrow confidence intervals; but in what
sense are confidence intervals “good” when cal-
ibration is perfect? Also, does calibration help
joint inference in NLP pipelines? It may also assist
calculations that rely on expectations, such as in-
ference methods like minimum Bayes risk decod-
ing, or learning methods like EM, since calibrated
predictions imply that calculated expectations are
statistically unbiased (though the implications of
this fact may be subtle). Finally, it may be in-
teresting to pursue recalibration methods, which
readjust a non-calibrated model’s predictions to
be calibrated; recalibration methods have been de-
veloped for binary (Platt, 1999; Niculescu-Mizil
and Caruana, 2005) and multiclass (Zadrozny and
Elkan, 2002) classification settings, but we are
unaware of methods appropriate for the highly
structured outputs typical in linguistic analysis.
Another approach might be to directly constrain
CalibErr = 0 during training, or try to reduce it
as a training-time risk minimization or cost objec-
tive (Smith and Eisner, 2006; Gimpel and Smith,
2010; Stoyanov et al., 2011; Brümmer and Dod-
dington, 2013).

Calibration is an interesting and important prop-
erty of NLP models. Further work is necessary to
address these and many other questions.
