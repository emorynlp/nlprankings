Dynamic Adaptation in Dialog Systems

Marilyn Walker
University of California, Santa Cruz

A hallmark of human robust intelligence is the ability to flexibly and dynami-
cally adapt behavior to the current situation. For dialog behavior, this entails adap-
tation to features of both the dialog partner (e.g., relationship, age, personality) and
the dialog situation (e.g., task context, asynchronous interaction, limited modalities
such as voice-only communication). We don’t completely understand how humans
do this, nor do we have the ability to produce such dynamically adaptable behavior
in human computer dialog interaction. In this talk I will discuss our recent work on
dynamic adaptation to the user, and present some experimental results showing that
it is possible to automatically generate both verbal and nonverbal system behaviors
that are perceived by the user as reliably expressing particular system personalities.
I will describe two of my current projects at UCSC that are integrating these ca-
pabilities into mobile dialogue systems: SpyFeet, a role playing augmented reality
game for encouraging girls to exercise, and Skipper, a dialogue system that gives
pedestrians directions in both urban and campus environments.
