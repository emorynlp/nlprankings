Abstract 

In this paper, we present a machine learning 
approach that detects hedge cues and their 
scope in biomedical texts. Identifying hedged 
information in texts is a kind of semantic 
filtering of texts and it is important since it 
could extract speculative information from 
factual information. In order to deal with the 
semantic analysis problem, various evidential 
features are proposed and integrated through a 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. 
Hedge cues that appear in the training dataset 
are regarded as keywords and employed as an 
important feature in hedge cue identification 
system. For the scope finding, we construct a 
CRF-based system and a syntactic 
pattern-based system, and compare their 
performances. Experiments using test data 
from CoNLL-2010 shared task show that our 
proposed method is robust. F-score of the 
biological hedge detection task and scope 
finding task achieves 86.32% and 54.18% in 
in-domain evaluations respectively. 

1. Introduction 

Identifying sentences in natural language texts 
which contain unreliable or uncertain information 
is an increasingly important task of information 
extraction since the extracted information that 
falls in the scope of hedge cues cannot be 
presented as factual information. Szarvas et al. 
(2008) report that 17.69% of the sentences in the 
abstracts section of the BioScope corpus and 
22.29% of the sentences in the full papers section 
contain hedge cues. Light et al. (2004) estimate 
that 11% of sentences in MEDLINE abstracts 
contain speculative fragments. Szarvas (2008) 
reports that 32.41% of gene names mentioned in 
the hedge classification dataset described in 
Medlock and Briscoe (2007) appear in a 
speculative sentence. Many Wikipedia articles 

contain a specific weasel tag which mark 
sentences as non-factual (Ganter and Strube, 
2009). 

There are some Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) researches that demonstrate the benefit of 
hedge detection experimentally in several 
subjects, such as the ICD-9-CM coding of 
radiology reports and gene named Entity 
Extraction (Szarvas, 2008), question answering 
systems (Riloff et al., 2003), information 
extraction from biomedical texts (Medlock and 
Briscoe, 2007). 

The CoNLL-2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al., 
2010) “Learning to detect hedges and their scope 
in natural language text” proposed two tasks 
related to speculation research. Task 1 aimed to 
identify sentences containing uncertainty and 
Task 2 aimed to resolve the in-sentence scope of 
hedge cues. We participated in both tasks. 

In this paper, a machine learning system is 
constructed to detect sentences in texts which 
contain uncertain or unreliable information and to 
find the scope of hedge cues. The system works 
in two phases: in the first phase uncertain 
sentences are detected, and in the second phase 
in-sentence scopes of hedge cues are found. In the 
uncertain information detecting phase, hedge 
cues play an important role. The sentences that 
contain at least one hedge cue are considered as 
uncertain, while sentences without cues are 
considered as factual. Therefore, the task of 
uncertain information detection can be converted 
into the task of hedge cue identification. Hedge 
cues that appear in the training dataset are 
collected and used as keywords to find hedges. 
Furthermore, the detected keywords are 
employed as an important feature in hedge cue 
identification system. In addition to keywords, 
various evidential features are proposed and 
integrated through a machine learning model. 
Finding the scope of a hedge cue is to determine 
at sentence level which words are affected by the 

106



 

 

hedge cue. In the scope finding phase, we 
construct a machine learning-based system and a 
syntactic pattern-based system, and compare their 
performances. 

For the learning algorithm, Conditional random 
fields (CRFs) is adopted relying on its flexible 
feature designs and good performance in 
sequence labeling problems as described in 
Lafferty et al. (2001). The main idea of CRFs is 
to estimate a conditional probability distribution 
over label sequences, rather than over local 
directed label sequences as with Hidden Markov 
Models (Baum and Petrie, 1966) and Maximum 
Entropy Markov Models (McCallum et al., 
2000). 

Evaluation is carried out on the CoNLL-2010 
shared task (Farkas et al., 2010) dataset in which 
sentences containing uncertain information are 
annotated. For the task of detecting uncertain 
information, uncertain cues are annotated. And 
for the task of finding scopes of hedge cues, 
hedge cues and their scope are annotated as 
shown in sentence (a): hedge cue indicate that, 
and its scope indicate that dhtt is widely 
expressed at low levels during all stages of 
Drosophila development are annotated. 

 
(a)Together, these data <xcope 

id="X8.74.1"><cue ref="X8.74.1" 
type="speculation">indicate that</cue> dhtt 
is widely expressed at low levels during all 
stages of Drosophila development</xcope>. 

2. Related Work 

In the past few years, a number of studies on 
hedge detection from NLP perspective have been 
proposed. Elkin et al. (2005) exploited 
handcrafted rule-based negation/uncertainty 
detection modules to detect the negation or 
uncertainty information. However, their detection 
modules were hard to develop due to the lack of 
standard corpora that used for evaluating the 
automatic detection and scope resolution. Szarvas 
et al. (2008) constructed a corpus annotated for 
negations, speculations and their linguistic scopes. 
It provides a common resource for the training, 
testing and comparison of biomedical NLP 
systems. 

Medlock and Briscoe (2007) proposed an 
automatic classification of hedging in biomedical 
texts using weakly supervised machine learning. 
They started with a very limited amount of 
annotator-labeled seed data. Then they iterated 
and acquired more training seeds without much 

manual intervention. The best classifier using 
their model achieved 0.76 precision/recall 
break-even-point (BEP). Further, Medlock 
(2008) illuminated the hedge identification task 
including annotation guidelines, theoretical 
analysis and discussion. He argued for separation 
of the acquisition and classification phases in 
semi-supervised machine learning method and 
presented a probabilistic acquisition model. In 
probabilistic model he assumed bigrams and 
single terms as features based on the intuition that 
many hedge cues are bigrams and single terms 
and achieves a peak performance of around 0.82 
BEP.  

Morante and Daelemans (2009) presented a 
meta-learning system that finds the scope of 
hedge cues in biomedical texts. The system 
worked in two phases: in the first phase hedge 
cues are identified, and in the second phase the 
full scopes of these hedge cues are found. The 
performance of the system is tested on three 
subcorpora of the BioScope corpus. In the hedge 
finding phase, the system achieves an F-score of 
84.77% in the abstracts subcorpus. In the scope 
finding phase, the system with predicted hedge 
cues achieves an F-score of 78.54% in the 
abstracts subcorpus. 

The research on detecting uncertain 
information is not restricted to analyze 
biomedical documents. Ganter and Strube (2009) 
investigated Wikipedia as a source of training 
data for the automatic hedge detection using word 
frequency measures and syntactic patterns. They 
showed that the syntactic patterns worked better 
when using the manually annotated test data, 
word frequency and distance to the weasel tag 
was sufficient when using Wikipedia weasel tags 
themselves. 

3. Identifying Hedge Cues 

Previous studies (Light et al., 2004) showed that 
the detection of hedging could be solved 
effectively by looking for specific keywords 
which were useful for deciding whether a 
sentence was speculative. Szarvas (2008) reduces 
the number of keyword candidates without 
excluding helpful keywords for hedge 
classification. Here we also use a simple 
keyword-based hedge cue detection method. 

3.1 Keyword-based Hedge Cue Detection 

In order to recall as many hedge cues as possible, 

107



 

 

all hedge cues that appear in the training dataset 
are used as keywords. Hedge cues are represented 
by one or more tokens. The list of all hedge cues 
in the training dataset is comprised of 143 cues. 
90 hedge cues are unigrams, 24 hedge cues are 
bigrams, and the others are trigrams, four-grams 
and five-grams. Besides, hedge cues that appear 
in the training dataset and their synonyms in 
WordNet 1  are also selected as keywords for 
hedge cue detection. The complete list of them 
contains 438 keywords, 359 of which are 
unigrams. Many tokens appear in different grams 
cues, such as possibility appears in five-grams 
cue cannot rule out the possibility, four-gram cue 
cannot exclude the possibility, trigrams cue raise 
the possibility and unigram cue possibility. To 
find the complete cues, keywords are matched 
through a maximum matching method (MM) (Liu 
et al., 1994). For example, though indicate and 
indicate that are both in keywords list, indicate 
that is extracted as a keyword in sentence (a) 
through MM. 

3.2 CRF-based Hedge Cue Detection 

Candidate cues are extracted based on keywords 
list in keyword-based hedge cue detection stage. 
But the hedge cue is extremely ambiguous, so 
CRFs are applied to correct the false 
identification results that occurred in the 
keyword-based hedge cue detection stage. The 
extracted hedge cues are used as one feature for 
CRFs-based hedge cue detection. 

A CRF identifying model is generated by 
applying a CRF tool to hedge cue labeled 
sequences. Firstly, hedge cue labeled sentences 
are transformed into a set of tokenized word 
sequences with IOB2 labels: 

 
B-cue Current token is the beginning of a 

hedge cue 
I-cue Current token is inside of  a hedge cue 

O Current token is outside of any hedge 
cue  

 
For sentence (a) the system assigns the B-cue 

tag to indicate, the I-cue tag to that and the O tag 
to the rest of tokens as shown in Figure1. 

The hedge cues that are found by 
keyword-based method is also given IOB2 labels 
feature as shown in Figure1.

Diverse features including keyword feature are 
employed to our CRF-based hedge cue detection 
system. 

 
(1) Word Features 
• Word (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
Where Word (0) is the current word, Word (-1) 

is the first word to the left, Word (1) is the first 
word to the right, etc. 

 
(2) Stem Features 
The motivation for stemming in hedge 

identification is that distinct morphological forms 
of hedge cues are used to convey the same 
semantics (Medlock, 2008). In our method, 
GENIA Tagger2 (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) is applied 
to get stem features. 

• Stem (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
where Stem (0) is the stem for the current word, 

Stem(-1) is the first stem to the left, Stem (1) is the 
first stem to the right, etc. 

 
(3) Part-Of-Speech Features  
Since most of hedge cues in the training dataset 

are verbs, auxiliaries, adjectives and adverbs. 
Therefore, Part-of-Speech (POS) may provide 
useful evidence about the hedge cues and their 
boundaries. GENIA Tagger is also used to 
generate this feature.  

• POS (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
where POS (0) is the current POS, POS (-1) is 

the first POS to the left, POS (1) is the first POS 
to the right, etc. 

 
(4) Chunk Features 
Some hedge cues are chunks consisting of more 

than one token. Chunk features may contribute to 
the hedge cue boundaries. We use GENIA 
Tagger to get chunk features for each token. The

http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/tagger/

chunk features include unigram, bigram, and 
trigram types, listed as follows: 

• Chunk (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
• Chunk (i−1)+Chunk(i) (i =−1,0,+1,+2) 
• Chunk (i−2) + Chunk (i−1)+Chunk (i) (i= 

0,+1,+2) 
where Chunk (0) is the chunk label for the 

current word, Chunk (−1) is the chunk label for 
the first word to the left , Chunk (1) is the chunk 
label for the first word to the right, etc. 

 
(5) Keyword Features 
Keyword labels feature is an important feature. 
• Keyword (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, 

+n) 
where Keyword (0) is the current keyword label, 

Keywords (-1) is the keyword label for the first 
keyword to the left, Keywords (1) is the keyword 
label for the first keyword to the right, etc. 

Feature sets can be easily redefined by 
changing the window size n. The relationship of 
the window size and the F-score observed in our 
experiments will be reported in Section 5. 

4. Hedge Scope Finding 

In this task, a CRFs classifier is applied to predict 
for all the tokens in the sentence whether a token 
is the first token of the scope sequence (F-scope), 
the last token of the scope sequence (L-scope), or 
neither (None). For sentence (a) in Section 1, the 
classifier assigns F-scope to indicate, L-scope to 
benchmarks, and None to the rest of the tokens. 
Only sentences that assigned cues in the first 
phase are selected for hedge scope finding. 
Besides, a syntactic pattern-based system is 
constructed, and compared with the CRF-based 
system. 

4.1 CRF-based System 

The features that used in CRF-based hedge cue 
detection systems are also used for scope finding 
except for the keyword features. The features are: 
 

(1) Word Features 
• Word (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
 
(2) Stem Features 
• Stem (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
(3) Part-Of-Speech Features  
• POS (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
 
(4) Chunk Features 
The chunk features include unigram, bigram, 

and trigram types, listed as follows: 
 
• Chunk (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, +n) 
• Chunk (i−1)+Chunk(i) (i =−1,0,+1,+2) 
• Chunk (i−2) + Chunk (i−1)+Chunk (i) (i= 

0,+1,+2) 
 
(5) Hedge cues Features 
Hedge cues labels that are doped out in Task 1 

are selected as an important feature. 
 
• Hedge cues (i) (i=-n, …, −2, −1, 0, +1, +2, …, 

+n) 
where Hedge cues (0) is the cue label for the 

current word, Hedge cues (−1) is the cue label for 
the first word to the left , Hedge cues (1) is the 
cue label for the first word to the right, etc. 

The scope of the sequence must be consistent 
with the hedge cues. That means that the number 
of the F-scope and L-scope must be the same with 
the hedge cues. However, sometimes their 
number predicted by classifier is not same. 
Therefore, we need to process the output of the 
classifier to get the complete sequence of the 
scope. The following post processing rules are 
adapted. 

 
• If the number of F-scope, L-scope and hedge 
cue is the same, the sequence will start at the 
token predicted as F-scope, and end at the 
token predicted as L-scope. 
• If one token has been predicted as F-scope 
and none has been predicted as L-scope, the 
sequence will start at the token predicted as 
F-scope and end at the end of the sentence. 
Since when marking the scopes of keywords, 
linguists always extend the scope to the biggest 
syntactic unit possible. 
• If one token has been predicted as L-scope 
and none has been predicted as F-scope, the 
sequence will start at the hedge cue and end at 
the token predicted as L-scope. Since scopes 
must contain their cues. 
• If one token has been predicted as F-scope 
and more than one has been predicted as 
L-scope, the sequence will end at the first token 
predicted as L-scope. Statistics from prediction 
on CoNLL-2010 Shared Task evaluation data 
show that 20 sentences are in this case. And the 
scope of 6 sentences extends to the first 
L-scope, and the scope of 3 sentences end at 
the last L-scope, the others are predicted 
mistakenly. Our system prediction and 
gold-standard annotation are shown in sentence 
(b1) and (b2) respectively. 

109



 

 

 
(b1) our system annotation: 
dRas85DV12 <xcope id="X3.64.1"><cue 
ref="X3.64.1" type="speculation">may</cue> 
be more potent than dEGFRλ</xcope> because 
dRas85DV12 can activate endogenous PI3K 
signaling</xcope> [16]. 
 
(b2) gold-standard annotation: 
dRas85DV12 <xcope id="X3.64.1"><cue 
ref="X3.64.1" 
type="speculation">may</cue> be more 
potent than dEGFRλ</xcope> because 
dRas85DV12 can activate endogenous PI3K 
signaling [16]. 
 
• If one token has been predicted as L-scope 
and more than one has been predicted as 
F-scope, the sequence will start at the first 
token predicted as F-scope. 
• If an L-scope is predicted before an F-scope, 
the sequence will start at the token predicted as 
F-scope, and finished at the end of the sentence.  

4.2 Syntactic Pattern-based System 

Hedge scopes usually can be determined on the 
basis of syntactic patterns dependent on the cue. 
Therefore, a syntactic pattern-based system is 
also implemented for hedge scope finding. When 
the sentence is predicted as uncertain, the toolkit 
of Stanford Parser3 (Klein and Manning, 2003) is 
utilized to parse the sentence into a syntactic tree, 
which can release a lot of information about the 
grammatical structure of sentences that is 
beneficial for the finding of hedge scope. For 
sentence (c) the Stanford Parser gives the 
syntactic tree as showed in Figure 2. 
 
(c) This <xcope id="X*.*.*"><cue ref="X*.*.*" 
type="speculation"> may </cue> represent a 
viral illness</xcope>. 

It is obvious to see from the syntactic tree, all 
the words of the parsed sentence concentrate at 
the places of leaves. We use the following rules to 
find the scope. 

• If the tag of the word is “B-cue”, it is predicted 
as F-scope. 

• If the POS of the hedge cue is verbs and 
auxiliaries, the L-scope is signed at the end of the 
clause. 

• If the POS of the hedge cue is attributive

http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml  

adjectives, the L-scope is signed at the following 
noun phrase.  

• If the POS of the hedge cue is prepositions, the 
L-scope is signed at the following noun phrase. 

• If none of the above rules apply, the scope of a 
hedge cue starts with the hedge cue and ends at 
the following clause.

Parser 

5. Experiments and Discussion 

We evaluate our method using CoNLL-2010 
shared task dataset. The evaluation of uncertain 
information detection task is carried out using the 
sentence-level F-score of the uncertainty class. 
As mentioned in Section 1, Task 1 is converted 
into the task of hedge cues identification. 
Sentences can be classified as certain or uncertain 
according to the presence or absence of a few 
hedge cues within the sentences. In task of 
finding in-sentence scopes of hedge cues, a scope 
is correct if all the tokens in the sentence have 
been assigned the correct scope class for a 
specific hedge signal. 

5.1 Detecting Uncertain Information 

In the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task 1, our 
in-domain system obtained the F-score of 85.77%. 
Sentence-level results of in-domain systems 
under the condition n=3 (window size) are 
summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Official in-domain results for Task 1 

(n=3) 
 
The keyword-based system extracts hedge cues 

through maximum matching method (MM). As 
can be seen in Table 1, the system achieves a high 
recall (99.24%). This can be explained that 
almost all of the hedge cues in the test dataset are 
in the keywords list. However, it also brings 
about the low precision since not all potential 
speculative keywords convey real speculation. So 
the keyword-based method can be combined with 
our CRF-based method to get better performance. 

All the CRF-based systems in Table 1 
significantly outperform the keyword-based 
system, since the multi-features achieve a high 
precision. And the result with keyword features is 
better than the result without it. The keyword 
features improve the performance by recalling 39 
true positives. In addition, further improvement is 
achieved by using Maximum Matching method 
(MM). 

In the test dataset, there should be a few hedge 
cues not in the training dataset. And the 
additional resources besides the manually labeled 
data are allowed for in-domain predictions. 
Therefore, the synonyms of the keywords can be 
used for in-domain systems. The synonyms of the 
keywords are added to the keywords list, and are 
expected to improve detecting performance. The 
synonyms are obtained from WordNet. 

Table 2 shows the relationship between the 
window size and the sentence-level results. This 
table shows the results with and without 
synonyms. Generally, the results with synonyms 
are better than the results without them. With 
respect to window size, the wider the window 
size, the better precision can be achieved. 
However, large window size leads to low recall 
which is probably because of data sparse. The 
best F-score 86.32 is obtained when the window 
size is +/-4.

5.2 Finding Hedge Scope 

In the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task 2, our 
in-domain system obtained the F-score of 44.42%. 
Table 3 shows the scope finding results. For 
in-domain scope finding system, we use the 
hedge cues extracted by the submitted CRF-based 
in-domain system (the best result 85.77 in Table 
1). The result of the syntactic pattern-based 
system is not ideal probably due to the syntactic 
parsing errors and limited annotation rules.

Table 3: Official in-domain results for Task 2 

 
Through analyzing the false of our scope 

finding system, we found that many of our false 
scope were caused by such scope as sentence (d1) 
shows. Our CRF-based system signed the 
L-scope to the end of sentence mistakenly. The 
incorrectly annotation of our system and 
gold-standard annotation are shown in sentence 
(d1) and (d2) respectively. So an additional rule is 
added to our CRF-based system to correct the 
L-scope. The rule is: 
• If one token has been predicted as L-scope, 

and if the previous token is “)”, or “]”, the 
L-scope will be modified just before the 
paired token “(” or “[”. 

 
(d1) The incorrectly predicted version: 
These factors were <cue ref="X1.178.1" 
type="speculation">presumed</cue> to be 
pathogenic</xcope> (85).  
(d2) Gold-standard annotation: 
These factors were <cue ref="X1.178.1" 
type="speculation">presumed</cue> to be 
pathogenic (85) </xcope>.

F-score is reached to 51.83 by combining this 
additional rule with the submitted CRF-based 
in-domain system as shown in Table 4.

Table 4: Official in-domain results for Task 2 
 
Several best results of Task 1 are exploited to 

investigate the relationship between the window 
size and the scope finding results. From the 
results of Table 5, we can see that the case of n=4 
gives the best precision, recall and F-score. And 
the case of n=2 and the case of n=3 based on the 
same task 1 system have a very similar score. 
With respect to the different systems of Task 1, in 
principle, the higher the F-score of Task 1, the 
better the performance of Task 2 can be expected. 
However, the result is somewhat different from 
the expectation. The best F-score of Task 2 is 
obtained under the case F-score (task 1) =86.02. 
This indicates that it is not certain that Task 2 
system based on the best Task 1 result gives the 
best scope finding performance.

Table 5: Scope finding results relative to the 

results of task 1 and window size 
 

In the case that scopes longer than n (window 
size) words, the relevant cue will thus not fall into 
the +/-n word window of the L-scope and all 
hedge cue features will be O tag. The hedge cue 
features will be useless for detecting L-scopes. 
Taking into account the importance of hedge cue 
features, the following additional features are 
also incorporated to capture hedge cue features. 

 
• Distance to the closest preceding hedge cue 
• Distance to the closest following hedge cue 
• Stem of the closest preceding hedge cue 
• Stem of the closest following hedge cue  
• POS of the closest preceding hedge cue 

• POS of the closest following hedge cue 
 
Table 6 shows the results when the additional 

hedge cue features are used. The results with 
additional hedge cue feature set are constantly 
better than the results without them. In most of 
cases, the improvement is significant. The best 
F-score 54.18% is achieved under the case 
F-score (task 1) =86.02 and n=4.

A comparative character analysis of syntactic 
pattern-based method and CRF-based method 
will be interesting, which can provide insights 
leading to better methods in the future. 

6. Conclusion 

In this paper, we have exploited various useful 
features evident to detect hedge cues and their 
scope in biomedical texts. For hedge detection 
task, keyword-based system is integrated with 
CRF-based system by introducing keyword 
features to CRF-based system. Our experimental 
results show that the proposed method improves 
the performance of CRF-based system by the 
additional keyword features. Our system has 
achieved a state of the art F-score 86.32% on the 
sentence-level evaluation. For scope finding task,

two different systems are established: CRF-based 
and syntactic pattern-based system. CRF-based 
system outperforms syntactic pattern-based 
system due to its evidential features. 

In the near future, we will improve the hedge 
cue detection performance by investigating more 
implicit information of potential keywords. On 
the other hand, we will study on how to improve 
scope finding performance by integrating 
CRF-based and syntactic pattern-based scope 
finding systems.
