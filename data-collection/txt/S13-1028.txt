Abstract

Soft cardinality has been shown to be a very
strong text-overlapping baseline for the task of
measuring semantic textual similarity (STS),
obtaining 3rd place in SemEval-2012. At
*SEM-2013 shared task, beside the plain text-
overlapping approach, we tested within soft
cardinality two distributional word-similarity
functions derived from the ukWack corpus.
Unfortunately, we combined these measures
with other features using regression, obtain-
ing positions 18th, 22nd and 23rd among the
90 participants systems in the official rank-
ing. Already after the release of the gold stan-
dard annotations of the test data, we observed
that using only the similarity measures with-
out combining them with other features would
have obtained positions 6th, 7th and 8th; more-
over, an arithmetic average of these similarity
measures would have been 4th(mean=0.5747).
This paper describes both the 3 systems as
they were submitted and the similarity mea-
sures that would obtained those better results.

1 Introduction

The task of textual semantic similarity (STS) con-
sists in providing a similarity function on pairs of
texts that correlates with human judgments. Such
a function has many practical applications in NLP
tasks (e.g. summarization, question answering, tex-
tual entailment, paraphrasing, machine translation
evaluation, among others), which makes this task
particularly important. Numerous efforts have been
devoted to this task (Lee et al., 2005; Mihalcea et al.,
2006) and major evaluation campaigns have been

held at SemEval-2012 (Agirre et al., 2012) and in
*SEM-2013 (Agirre et al., 2013).

The experimental setup of STS in 2012 consisted
of three data sets, roughly divided in 50% for train-
ing and for testing, which contained text pairs manu-
ally annotated as a gold standard. Furthermore, two
data sets were provided for surprise testing. The
measure of performance was the average of the cor-
relations per data set weighted by the number of
pairs in each data set (mean). The best performing
systems were UKP (Bär et al., 2012) mean=0.6773,
TakeLab (Šaric et al., 2012) mean=0.6753 and soft
cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2012) mean=0.6708.
UKP and TakeLab systems used a large number of
resources (see (Agirre et al., 2012)) such as dictio-
naries, a distributional thesaurus, monolingual cor-
pora, Wikipedia, WordNet, distributional similar-
ity measures, KB similarity, POS tagger, machine
learning and others. Unlike those systems, the soft
cardinality approach used mainly text overlapping
and conventional text preprocessing such as remov-
ing of stop words, stemming and idf term weighting.
This shows that the additional gain in performance
from using external resources is small and that the
soft cardinality approach is a very challenging base-
line for the STS task. Soft cardinality has been
previously shown (Jimenez and Gelbukh, 2012) to
be also a good baseline for other applications such
as information retrieval, entity matching, paraphrase
detection and recognizing textual entailment.

Soft cardinality approach to constructing similar-
ity functions (Jimenez et al., 2010) consists in using
any cardinality-based resemblance coefficient (such
as Jaccard or Dice) but substituting the classical set

194



cardinality with a softened counting function called
soft cardinality. For example, the soft cardinality of
a set containing three very similar elements is close
to (though larger than) 1, while for three very dif-
ferent elements it is close to (though less than) 3.
To use the soft cardinality with texts, they are repre-
sented as sets of words, and a word-similarity func-
tion is used for the soft counting of the words. For
the sake of completeness, we give a brief overview
of the soft-cardinality method in Section 3.

The resemblance coefficient used in our participa-
tion is a modified version of Tversky’s ratio model
(Tversky, 1977). Apart from the two parameters of
this coefficient, a new parameter was included and
functions max and min were used to make it sym-
metrical. The rationale for this new coefficient is
given in Section 2.

Three word similarity features used in our sys-
tems are described in Section 4. The one is a mea-
sure of character q-gram overlapping, which reuses
the coefficient proposed in Section 2; this measure is
described in subsection 4.1. The other two ones are
distributional measures obtained from the ukWack
corpus (Baroni et al., 2009), which is a collection of
web-crawled documents containing about 1.9 billion
words in English. The second measure is, again, a
reuse of the coefficient specified in Section 2, but us-
ing instead sets of occurrences (and co-occurrences)
of words in sentences in the ukWack corpus; this
measure is described in subsection 4.2. Finally, the
third one, which is a normalized version of point-
wise mutual information (PMI), is described in sub-
section 4.3.

The parameters of the three text-similarity func-
tions derived from the combination of the proposed
coefficient of resemblance (Section 2), the soft car-
dinality (Section 3) and the three word-similarity
measures (Section 4) were adjusted to maximize the
correlation with the 2012 STS gold standard data.
At this point, these soft-cardinality similarity func-
tions can provide predictions for the test data. How-
ever, we decided to test the approach of learning a
resemblance function from the training data instead
of using a preset resemblance coefficient. Basically,
most resemblance coefficients are ternary functions
F (x, y, z) where x = |A|, y = |B| and z = |A∩B|:
e.g. Dice coefficient is F (x, y, z) = 2z/x+y and Jac-
card is F (x, y, z) = z/x+y−z. Thus, this function

can be learned using a regression model, providing
cardinalities x, y and z as features and the gold stan-
dard value as the target function. The results ob-
tained for the text-similarity functions and the re-
gression approach are presented in Section 7.

Unfortunately, when using a regressor trained
with 2012 STS data and tested with 2013 surprise
data we observed that the results worsened rather
than improved. A short explanation of this is over-
fitting. A more detailed discussion of this, together
with an assessment of the performance gain obtained
by the use of distributional measures is provided in
Section 8.

Finally, in Section 9 the conclusions of our partic-
ipation in this evaluation campaign are presented.

2 Symmetrical Tversky’s Ratio Model

In the field of mathematical psychology Tversky
proposed the ratio model (TRM) (Tversky, 1977)
motivated by the imbalance that humans have on
the selection of the referent to compare things. This
model is a parameterized resemblance coefficient to
compare two sets A and B given by the following
expression:

trm(A,B) =
|A ∩B|

α|A \B|+ β|B \A|+ |A ∩B|
,

Having α, β ≥ 0. The numerator represents the
commonality between A and B, and the denomina-
tor represents the referent for comparison. Parame-
ters α and β represent the preference in the selection
of A or B as referent. Tversky associated the set
cardinality, to the stimuli of the objects being com-
pared. Let us consider a Tversky’s example of the
70s: A is North Corea, B is red China and stimuli
is the prominence of the country. When subjects as-
sessed the similarity between A and B, they tended
to select the country with less prominence as ref-
erent. Tversky observed that α was larger than β
when subjects compared countries, symbols, texts
and sounds. Our motivation is to use this model by
adjusting the parameters α and β for better modeling
human similarity judgments for short texts.

However, this is not a symmetric model and the
parameters α and β, have the dual interpretation of
modeling the asymmetry in the referent selection,
while controlling the balance between |A ∩ B| and

195



|A−B|+ |B −A| as well. The following reformu-
lation, called symmetric TRM (strm), is intended to
address these issues:

strm(A,B) =
c

β (αa+ (1− α) b) + c
, (1)

a = min(|A − B|, |B − A|), b = max(|A −
B|, |B − A|) and c = |A ∩ B| + bias. In strm, α
models only the balance between the differences in
the cardinalities of A and B, and β models the bal-
ance between |A∩B| and |A−B|+|B−A|. Further-
more, the use of functions min and max makes the
measure to be symmetric. Although the motivation
for the bias parameter is empirical, we believe that
this reduces the effect of the common features that
are frequent and therefore less informative, e.g. stop
words. Note that for α = 0.5,β = 1 and bias = 0,
strm is equivalent to Dice’s coefficient. Similarity,
for α = 0.5,β = 2 and bias = 0, strm is equivalent
to the Jaccard’s coefficient.

3 Soft Cardinality

The cardinality of a set is its number of elements. By
definition, the sets do not allow repeated elements,
so if a collection of elements contains repetitions its
cardinality is the number of different elements. The
classical set cardinality does not take into account
similar elements, i.e. only the identical elements
in a collection counted once. The soft cardinality
(Jimenez et al., 2010) considers not only identical
elements but also similar using an auxiliary similar-
ity function sim, which compares pairs of elements.
This cardinality can be calculated for a collection of
elements A with the following expression:

|A|′ =
n∑

i=1

wi

 n∑
j=1

sim(ai, aj)
p

−1 (2)
A ={a1, a2, . . . , an}; wi ≥ 0; p ≥ 0; 1 >

sim(x, y) ≥ 0, x 6= y; and sim(x, x) = 1. The
parameter p controls the degree of "softness" of
the cardinality. This formulation has the property
of reproducing classical cardinality when p is large
and/or when sim is a rigid function that returns 1
only for identical elements and 0 otherwise. The co-
efficients wi are the weights associated with each el-
ement. In text applications elements ai are words

and weights wi represent the importance or infor-
mative character of each word (e.g. idf weights).
The apostrophe is used to differentiate soft cardinal-
ity from the classic set cardinality.

4 Word Similarity

Analogous to the STS, the word similarity is the task
of measuring the relationship of a couple of words
in a way correlated with human judgments. Since
when Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) provided
the first data set, this task has been addressed pri-
marily through semantic networks (Resnik, 1999;
Pedersen et al., 2004) and distributional measures
(Agirre et al., 2009). However, other simpler ap-
proaches such as edit-distance (Levenshtein, 1966)
and stemming (Porter, 1980) can also be used. For
instance, the former identifies the similarity between
"song" and "sing", and later that between "sing" and
"singing". This section presents three approaches
for word similarity that can be plugged into the soft
cardinality expression in eq. 2.

4.1 Q-grams similarity

Q-grams are the collection of consecutive-
overlapped sub-strings of length q obtained
from the character string in a word. For instance,
the 2-grams (bi-grams) and 3-grams (trigrams) rep-
resentation of the word “sing” are {’#s’, ’si’, ’in’,
’ng’, ’g#’} and {’#si’, ’sin’, ’ing’, ’ng#’} respec-
tively. The character ’#’ is a padding character that
distinguishes q-grams at the beginning and ending
of a word. If the number of characters in a word is
greater or equal than q its representation in q-grams
is the word itself (e.g. the 6-grams in “sing” are
{’sing’}). Moreover, the 1-grams (unigrams) and
0-grams representations of “sing” are {’s’, ’i’, ’n’,
’g’} and {’sing’}. A word can also be represented
by combining multiple representations of q-grams.
For instance, the combined representation of “sing”
using 0-grams, unigrams, and bi-grams is {’sing’,
’s’, ’i’, ’n’, ’g’, ’#s’, ’si’, ’in’, ’ng’, ’g#’}, denoted
by [0:2]-grams. In practice a range [q1 : q2] of
q-grams can be used having 0 ≤ q1 < q2.

The proposed word-similarity function (named
qgrams) first represents a pair of words using
[q1 : q2]-grams and then compares them reusing
the strm coefficient (eq.1). The parameters of the

196



qgrams function are q1, q2, αqgrams, βqgrams, and
biasqgrams. These parameters are sub-scripted to
distinguish them from their counterparts at the text-
similarity functions.

4.2 Context-Set Distributional Similarity

The hypothesis of this measure is that the co-
occurrence of two words in a sentence is a hint of
the possible relationship between them. Let us de-
fine sf(t) as the sentence frequency of a word t in
a corpus. The sentence frequency is equivalent to
the well known document frequency but uses sen-
tences instead of documents. Similarly sf(tA ∧ tB)
is the number of sentences where words tA and tB
co-occur. The idea is to compute a similarity func-
tion between tA and tB representing them as A and
B, which are sets of the sentences where tA and tB
occur. Similarly, A∩B is the set of sentences where
both words co-occur. The required cardinalities can
be obtained from the sentence frequencies by: |A| =
sf(tA); |B| = sf(tB) and |A ∩ B| = sf(tA ∧ tB).
These cardinalities are combined reusing again the
strm coefficient (eq. 1) to obtain a word-similarity
function. The parameters of this function, which we
refer to it as csds, are αcsds, βcsds and biascsds.

4.3 Normalized Point-wise Mutual Information

The pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a mea-
sure of relationship between two random variables.
PMI is calculated by the following expression:

pmi(tA, tB) = log2

(
P (tA ∧ tB)
P (tA) · P (tB)

)
PMI has been used to measure the relatedness of

pairs of words using the number of the hits returned
by a search engine (Turney, 2001; Bollegala et al.,
2007). However, PMI cannot be used directly as
sim function in eq.2. The alternative is to normal-
ize it dividing it by log2(P (tA ∧ tB)) obtaining a
value in the [1,−1] interval. This measure returns
1 for complete co-occurrence, 0 for independence
and -1 for “never” co-occurring. Given that the re-
sults in the interval (0,-1] are not relevant, the final
normalized-trimmed expression is:

npmi(tA, tB) = max

[
pmi(tA, tB)

log2(P (tA ∧ tB))
, 0

]
(3)

The probabilities required by PMI can be obtained
by MLE using sentence frequencies in a large cor-
pus: P (tA) ≈ sf(tA)S , P (tB) ≈

sf(tB)
S ,and P (tA ∧

tB) ≈ sf(tA∧tB)S . Where S is the total number of
sentences in the corpus.

5 Text-similarity Functions

The “building blocks” proposed in sections 2,
3 and 4, are assembled to build three text-
similarity functions, namely STSqgrams, STScsds
and STSnpmi. The first component is the strm re-
semblance coefficient (eq. 1), which takes as argu-
ments a pair of texts represented as bags of words
with importance weights associated with each word.
In the following subsection 5.1 a detailed descrip-
tion of the procedure for obtaining such weighted
bag-of-words is provided.

The strm coefficient is enhanced by replac-
ing the classical cardinality by the soft cardinality,
which exploits two resources: importance weights
associated with each word (weights wi) and pair-
wise comparisons among words (sim). Unlike
STSqgrams measure, STScsds and STSnpmi mea-
sures require statistics from a large corpus. A brief
description of the used corpus and the method for
obtaining such statistics is described in subsection
5.2. Finally, the three proposed text-similarity func-
tions contain free parameters that need to be ad-
justed. The method used to get those parameters is
described in subsection 5.3.

5.1 Preprocessing and Term Weighting

All training and test texts were preprocessed with
the following sequence of actions: i) text strings
were tokenized, ii) uppercase characters are con-
verted into lower-cased equivalents, iii) stop-words
were removed, iv) punctuation marks were removed,
and v) words were stemmed using Porter’s algorithm
(1980). Then each stemmed word was weighted
with idf (Jones, 2004) calculated using the entire
collection of texts.

5.2 Sentence Frequencies from Corpus

The sentence frequencies sf(t) and sf(tA ∧ tB) re-
quired by csds and npmi word-similarity func-
tions were obtained from the ukWack corpus (Ba-
roni et al., 2009). This corpus has roughly 1.9 bil-

197



lion words, 87.8 millions of sentences and 2.7 mil-
lions of documents. The corpus was iterated sen-
tence by sentence with the same preprocessing that
was described in the previous section, looking for
all occurrences of words and word pairs from the
full training and test texts. The target words were
stored in a trie, making the entire corpus iteration
took about 90 minutes in a laptop with 4GB and a
1.3Ghz processor.

5.3 Parameter optimization

The three proposed text-similarity functions have
several parameters: p exponent in the soft car-
dinality; α, β, and bias in strm coefficient;
their sub-scripted versions in qgrams and csds
word-similarity functions; and finally q1and q2 for
qgrams function. Parameter sets for each of the
three text-similarity functions were optimized us-
ing the full STS-SemEval-2012 data. The function
to maximize was the correlation between similar-
ity scores against the gold standard in the training
data. The set of parameters for each similarity func-
tion were optimized using a greedy hill-climbing ap-
proach by using steps of 0.01 for all parameters ex-
cept q1 and q2 that used 1 as step. The initial values
were p = 1, α = 0.5, β = 1, bias = 0, q1 = 2 and
q2 = 3. All parameters were optimized until im-
provement in the function to maximize was below
0.0001. The obtained values are :

STSqgrams p = 1.32,α = 0.52, β = 0.64, bias =
−0.45, q1 = 0, q2 = 2, αqgrams = 0.95,
βqgrams = 1.44, biasqgrams = −0.44.

STScsds p = 0.5, α = 0.63, β = 0.69, bias =
−2.05, αcsds = 1.34, βcsds = 2.57, biascsds =
−1.22 .

STSnpmi p = 6.17,α = 0.83, β = 0.64, bias =
−2.11.

6 Regression for STS

The use of regression is motivated by the follow-
ing experiment. First, a synthetic data set with
1,000 instances was generated with the following
three features: |A| = RandomBetween(1, 100),
|B| = RandomBetween(1, 100) and |A ∩ B| =
RandomBetween(0,min[|A|, |B|]). Secondly, a

#2 |A|′ #12 |A∩B|′/|B|′
#3 |B|′ #13 |A|′ · |B|′

#4 |A ∩B|′ #14 |A∩B|′/|A∪B|′
#5 |A ∪B|′ #15 2·|A∩B|′/|A|′+|B|′
#6 |A \B|′ #16 |A∩B|/min[|A|,|B|]
#7 |B \A|′ #17 |A∩B|′/max[|A|′,|B|′]
#8 |A ∪B −A ∩B|′ #18 |A∩B|′/√|A|′·|B|′

′+|A|′+|B|′

2·|A|′·|B|′

#10 |B−A|′/|B|′ #20 gold standard

Table 1: Feature set for regression

linear regressor was trained using the Dice’s coef-
ficient (i.e. 2|A ∩ B|/|A| + |B|) as target function.
The Pearson correlation obtained using 4-fold cross-
validation as method of evaluation was r = 0.93.
Besides, a Reduced Error Pruning (REP) tree (Wit-
ten and Frank, 2005) boosted with 30 iterations of
Bagging (Breiman, 1996) was used instead of the
linear regressor obtaining r = 0.99. We concluded
that a particular resemblance coefficient can be ac-
curately approximated using a nonlinear regression
algorithm and training data.

This approach can be used for replacing the strm
coefficient by a similarity function learned from STS
training data. The three features used in the previ-
ous experiment were extended to a total of 19 (see
table 1) plus the gold standard as target. The feature
#1 is the score of the corresponding text-similarity
function described in the previous section. Three
sets of features were constructed, each with 19 fea-
tures using the soft cardinality in combination with
the word-similarity functions qgrams, csds and
npmi. Let us name these feature sets as fs:qgrams,
fs:csds and fs:npmi. The submission labeled run1
was obtained using the feature set fs:qgrams (19 fea-
tures). The submission labeled run2 was obtained
using the aggregation of fs:qgrams and fs:csds (19×
2 = 38 features). Finally, run3 was the aggregation
of fs:grams, fs:csds and fs:npmi (19 × 3 = 57 fea-
tures).

Table 3: Unofficial results using linear regression

of systems consist in using the scores of the three
text-similarity functions STSqgrams, STScsds and
STSnpmi. Table 2 shows the unofficial results of
these three systems. The bottom row shows the posi-
tions that these systems would have obtained if they
had been submitted to the *SEM shared task 2013.
The last column shows the results of a system that
combines the scores of three measures on a single
score calculating the arithmetic mean. This is the
best performing system obtained with the methods
described in this paper.

Tables 3 and 4 show unofficial and official re-
sults of the method described in section 6 using
linear regression and Bagging (30 iterations)+REP
tree respectively. These results were obtained using
WEKA (Hall et al., 2009).

8 Discussion

Contrary to the observation we made in training
data, the methods that used regression to predict the
gold standard performed poorly compared with the
text similarity functions proposed in Section 5. That
is, the results in Table 2 overcome those in Tables 3
and 4. Also in training data, Bagging+REP tree sur-
passed linear regression, but, as can be seen in tables
3 and 4 the opposite happened in test data. This is
a clear symptom of overfitting. However, the OnWN

rank 23 18 22

Table 4: Official results of the submitted runs to STS

data set was an exception, which obtained the best
results using linear regression. OnWN was the only
one among the 2013 data sets that was not a sur-
prise data set. Probably the 5.97% relative improve-
ment obtained in run3 by the linear regression versus
the best result in Table 2 may be justified owing to
some patterns discovered by the linear regressor in
the OnWN’2012 training data which are projected
on the OnWN’2013 test data.

It is worth noting that in all three sets of results,
the lowest mean was consistently obtained by the
text-overlapping methods, namely STSqgrams and
run1. The relative improvement in mean due to
the use of distributional measures against the text-
overlapping methods was 3.18%, 3.62% and 2.45%
in each set of results (see Tables 2, 3 and 4). In
FNWM data set, the biggest improvements achieved
55.88%, 31.11% and 11.50% respectively in the
three groups of results, followed by SMT data set.
Both in FNWN data set as in SMT, the texts are sys-
tematically longer than those found in OnWN and
headlines. This result suggests that the improvement
due to distributional measures is more significant in
longer texts than in the shorter ones.

Lastly, it is also important to notice that
the STSqgrams text-similarity function obtained
mean = 0.5570, which proved again to be a very
strong text-overlapping baseline for the STS task.

9 Conclusions

We participated in the CORE-STS shared task in
*SEM 2013 with satisfactory results obtaining po-
sitions 18th, 22nd, and 23rd in the official ranking.
Our systems were based on a new parameterized
resemblance coefficient derived from the Tversky’s

199



ratio model in combination with the soft cardinal-
ity. The three proposed text-similarity functions
used q-grams overlapping and distributional mea-
sures obtained from the ukWack corpus. These text-
similarity functions would have been attained posi-
tions 6th, 7th and 8th in the official ranking, besides
a simple average of them would have reached the
4thplace. Another important conclusion was that the
plain text-overlapping method was consistently im-
proved by the incremental use of the proposed distri-
butional measures. This result was most noticeable
in long texts.

In conclusion, the proposed text-similarity func-
tions proved to be competitive despite their simplic-
ity and the few resources used.
