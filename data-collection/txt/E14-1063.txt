Abstract

Although the performance of SMT sys-
tems has improved over a range of differ-
ent linguistic phenomena, negation has not
yet received adequate treatment.
Previous works have considered the prob-
lem of translating negative data as one of
data sparsity (Wetzel and Bond (2012)) or
of structural differences between source
and target language with respect to the
placement of negation (Collins et al.
(2005)). This work starts instead from the
questions ofwhat is meant by negation and
what makes a good translation of negation.
These questions have led us to explore the
use of semantics of negation in SMT —
specifically, identifying core semantic el-
ements of negation (cue, event and scope)
in a source-side dependency parse and re-
ranking hypotheses on the n-best list pro-
duced after decoding according to the ex-
tent to which an hypothesis realises these
elements.
The method shows considerable improve-
ment over the baseline as measured by
BLEU scores and Stanford’s entailment-
based MT evaluation metric (Padó et al.
(2009)).

1 Introduction

Translating negation is a task that involves more
than the correct rendering of a negation marker in
the target sentence. For instance, translating Italy
did not defeat France in 1909 differs from trans-
lating Italy defeated France in 1909, or France
did not defeat Italy in 1909, or Italy did not con-
quer France in 1909. These examples show that
translating negation also involves placing in the
right position the semantic arguments as well as
the event directly negated. Moreover, if the source

sentence was uttered in response to the statement I
think Italy defeated France in 1911, where the fo-
cus is the temporal argument in 1911, one can see
that the system should not lose track of the focus
of negation when producing the hypothesis trans-
lation.
Although negation must be appropriately ren-

dered to ensure correct representation of the se-
mantics of the source sentence in the machine out-
put, only some of the efforts to improve the transla-
tion of negation-bearing sentences in SMT address
the problem.
Wetzel and Bond (2012) considered negation as

a problem of data sparsity and so attempted to en-
rich the training data with negative paraphrases
of positive sentences. Collins et al. (2005) and
Li et al. (2009) both addressed differences in the
placement of negation in source and target texts,
by re-ordering negative elements in the source sen-
tence to better resemble their position in the corre-
sponding target text. Although these approaches
show improvement over the baseline, neither con-
siders negation as a linguistic phenomenon with
specific characteristics.
This we do in the work presented here: We iden-

tify the elements of negation that an MT system
has to reproduce and then devise a strategy to en-
sure that they are output correctly. These elements
we take to be the cue, event and scope of nega-
tion1. Unlike previous works, we first validate
the hypothesis that if the top-ranked translation in
the n-best list does not replicate elements of nega-
tion from the source, there may be a more accurate
translation after decoding, somewhere else on the
n-best list. If the hypothesis is false, then problems
in the translation of negation lie elsewhere.

1Due to its ambiguity and the fact that it is already in-
cluded in the scope, we have ignored the focus of negation.
That does not mean it may not be important to correctly re-
produce the focus; there might be cases where, although not
fully-capturing the scope, we want to translate correctly the
part that is directly negated or emphasised.

We use dependency parsing as a basis for N-
best list re-ranking. Dependencies between lexical
elements appear to encode all elements of nega-
tion, offering a robust and easily-applicable way
to extract negation-related information from a sen-
tence. We carry out our exploration of N-best list
re-ranking in two steps:

• First, an oracle translation is computed both
to assess the validity of the approach and to
understand the maximal extent to which it
could possibly enhance performance. An or-
acle translation is obtained by performing n-
best list re-ranking using reference transla-
tions as a gold-standard.
To avoid the problem in Chinese-English Hi-
erarchical Phrase-Based (HPB) translation of
loss and/or misplacement of negation-related
elements when hierarchical phrases are built,
Chinese source sentences are first broken into
sub-clauses Yang and Xue (2012), then trans-
lated and finally ”stitched” back together for
evaluation.

• Standard n-best list re-ranking is then per-
formed using only source-side information.
Hypotheses are re-ranked according to the
degree of similarity between the negation-
related elements in the hypotheses and those
in the source sentence. Here the correspon-
dence between source and target text is es-
tablished through lexical translation probabil-
ities output after training.

Results of this method show that n-best list rerank-
ing does lead to a significant improvement in
BLEU score. However, BLEU says nothing about
semantics, so we also evaluate the method using
Stanford’s entailment basedMTmetrics Padó et al.
(2009), and also show improvement here. In the
final section of the paper, we note the value of de-
veloping a custom metric that actually assesses the
components of negation.

2 Related works

Negation has been a widely discussed topic out-
side the field of SMT, with recent works focused
mainly on automatic detection of negation. Blanco
and Moldovan (2011) have established the distri-
bution of negative cues and the syntactic structures
in which they appear in the WSJ section of the
Penn Treebank, as a basis for automatically de-
tecting scope and focus of negation using simple

heuristics.
Machine-learning has been used by systems

participating in the *SEM 2012 shared task on
automatically detecting the scope and focus of
negation. Those systems with the best F1 mea-
sures (Chowdhury and Mahbub (2012), Read et al.
(2012) and Lapponi et al. (2012) all use a mix-
ture of SVM (Support Vector Machines) and CRF.
Their performance improves significantly when
syntactic features are also considered. In partic-
ular, Lapponi et al. (2012) use features extracted
from a dependency parse to guide their system to
detect the correct scope boundary.
In translation, only few efforts have focussed on

the problem of translating negation. Wetzel and
Bond (2012) treat it as resulting from data spar-
sity. To remedy this, they enrich their Japanese-
to-English training set with negative paraphrases
of positive sentences, where negation is inserted
as a ‘handle’ to the main verb after a sentence is
parsed using MSR (Minimal Recursion Semantics
Copestake et al. (2005)). Results show that BLEU
score improves on a test sub-set containing only
negative sentences when extra negative data is ap-
pended to the original training data and the lan-
guage model is enriched as well. However, system
performance deteriorates on both the original test
set and on positive sentences. Moreover, generat-
ing paraphrases with negation expressed only on
the main verb does not allow to fully capture the
various ways negation can be expressed.
Other works considered negation in the frame-

work of clause restructuring. Collins et al. (2005)
pre-process the German source to resemble the
structure of English while Li et al. (2009) tried
to swap the order of the words in a Chinese sen-
tence to resemble Korean. Rosa (2013) takes a
post-processing approach to negation in English-
Czech translation, “fixing” common errors such as
the loss of a negation cue by either generating the
morphologically negative form of the relevant verb
(if the verb has such a form) or prefixing the verb
with the negative prefix ne. Despite the improve-
ments, these approaches do not really address what
is special about negation.

3 Decomposing negation

Correctly translating negation involves more than
placing a negative marker in the right position. We
follow Blanco andMoldovan (2011) in decompos-
ing negation into three main components:

599



• a negation cue, including negative markers,
affixes and all the words or multiwords units
that inherently express negation.

• a negation event, i.e. the event that is directly
negated. Events can be either verbs (e.g. ‘I do
not go to the cinema) or adjectives (e.g. ‘He
is not clever’).

• a negation scope, i.e. the part of the state-
ment whose meaning is negated (Blanco and
Moldovan, 2011, 229). The scope contains all
those words that, if negated, would make the
statement true. We follow here the guidelines
for annotating negative data released during
the *SEM 2012 Shared Task Morante et al.
(2011) for a more detailed understanding on
what to consider part of the negation scope.

In addition to these three components, formal se-
manticists identify a negation focus, i.e. the part
of the scope that is directly negated or more em-
phasized. Focus is the most difficult part to detect
since it is the most ambiguous. In the sentence ‘he
does not want to go to school by car’ the speaker
emphasized the fact that ‘he does not want to go
to school by car’ or that ‘he does not want to go
to school by car’ (but he wants to go somewhere
else) or that ‘he does not want to go to school by
car’ (but by other means of transportation).
Translating negation is therefore a matter of en-

suring that the cue is present, that its attachment to
the corresponding event follows language-specific
rules and that all the elements included in the scope
are placed in the right order. Correctly reproduc-
ing the focus is left for future works.

4 Methodology

4.1 N-best list re-ranking
N-best list re-ranking is used in SMT to deal with
sentence-level phenomena whose locality goes be-
yond n-grams or single hierarchical rules. It in-
volves re-ranking the list of target-language hy-
potheses produced by decoding, using additional
features extracted from the source sentence. In the
case of negation, N-best list re-ranking allows us to
assess whether a system is able to correctly trans-
late the elements of negation, while failing to place
the best hypothesis on these grounds at the top of
the n-best list.
The current work follows the same approach as

other n-best list re-rankers (Och et al. (2004); Spe-
cia et al. (2008); Apidianaki et al. (2012)) but using

negation as the additional feature. Negation is here
defined as the degree of overlap of cue, event and
scope between the hypothesis translation and the
source sentence.
Following Hasan et al. (2007), we use an n-best

list of 10000 sentences but we do not initially tune
the negation feature using MERT or interpolate it
with other features. This is because in order to as-
sess the degree of overlap between the scope in
the source and the hypothesis sentence, a n-gram
based score is used which conveys the same in-
formation as that of the language model score in
the log-linear model. Moreover, our re-ranking ex-
ploits lexical translation probabilities, thereby re-
sembling a simple translation model.

4.2 Extract negation using dependency
parsing

The degree of overlap between the source sentence
and the hypothesis translation is measured in terms
of the overlap between their negation cue, event
and scope. These must therefore be correctly ex-
tracted. Dependency parsing provides an efficient
way to do so, with several advantages:

• Dependency parsing encodes the notions of
cue and event as the dependant and the head
respectively of a ‘neg’ relation. Scope can
be approximated through recursive retrieval
of all the descendants of the verb-event. The
following example shows how these elements
are extracted from the dependency parse:

Peter and

conj
��

conj
��

Mary did not buy

nsubj

��

punct

��

obj

��

aux

��
neg
��

a blue car

det

��
amod
��

.

nsubj(buy-6, and-2) , conj(and-2, Peter-1), conj (and-2, Mary-3),
aux(buy-6, did-4), neg(buy-6, not-5), root(ROOT-0, buy-6),
det(car-9, a-7), amod(car-9, blue-8) , dobj(buy-6, car-9)

The ‘neg’ dependency relation conveys both
the negation cue (not-5) and the negation
event (buy-6) of the sentence ‘Peter andMary
did not buy a blue car’. An approximate scope
can be recovered by following the path from
the event (included) to the terminal nodes and
collecting all the lexical elements along the
way.
Also in the case of a sentence containing
a subordinate clause, dependency parsing is

600



able to correctly capture the latter as part of
the scope given that the relative pronoun de-
pends directly on the event of the main clause.
On the other hand, recursion from the negated
event excludes coordinate clauses that are not
considered part of the scope, given that the
event is a dependant of the connective.
One problem with this method is that it is
unable to capture the entire scope when the
head is nominal. For instance, ‘no reasons
were given’, the ‘neg’ dependency holds be-
tween no and reasons but it needs to climb
the hierarchy further to get to the verbal head
given. The same holds for negation on ob-
ject nominals. We leave this to future work
(along with affix-conveyed negation), need-
ing to show first that the current approach is
a good one.

• A dependency parser can be developed for
any language for which a Treebank or Prop-
bank is available for training. This extends
the range of source languages to which the ap-
proach can be applied.

4.3 Computing an oracle translation
In order to test the validity of the method and to
assess its maximum contribution, we first use it
with an oracle translation in which n-best list re-
ranking relies on a comparison with negation cue,
event and scope extracted from the reference trans-
lation(s), here assumed to correctly contain all el-
ements of negation.
Each hypothesis on the n-best list is assigned

an overlap score with these reference-translation-
derived elements, and the hypothesis with the
highest score is re-ranked at the top and used for
evaluation.
The overlap score is obtained by summing up

three sub-scores: (i) the cue overlap score mea-
sures how many cues in reference are repre-
sented in the hypothesis, normalised by the num-
ber of cues in the reference; (ii) the event over-
lap score measures how many events in the refer-
ence are represented in the hypothesis, normalised
by the number of the events in the reference;
and (iii) the scope overlap score is a weighted n-
gram overlap between hypothesis scope and ref-
erence scope, with higher weight for higher-order
n-grams. Given less-than-perfect machine out-
put, breaking down the score into subscores al-
lows us to consider different degrees of correct-

ness in translating negation. When multiple ref-
erence translations are available, the hypothesis is
matched with each, and only the best score taken
into consideration.

4.4 Re-ranking using lexical translation
probabilities

After the oracle translation is computed, tradi-
tional n-best list re-ranking is performed relying
on source side information only. We then bridge
the gap between source and target language using
lexical translation probabilities to render source-
side cue, event, scope into the target language. Re-
ranking involves three separate steps:

• The source sentence is parsed and dependen-
cies extracted. Since the present work tack-
les Chinese-to-English translation, we had to
enhance the representation of negative depen-
dencies in the Chinese source, where only the
adverb 不 bu4 is flagged as ‘neg’ dependant.
To do this, we follow the same intuition used
to isolate negation-bearing sentences in the
test set (see section 5).

• To obtain a rough translation of cue, event and
scope in the target language, the top ten lex-
ical translation probabilities for each lexical
item, available in the lexical translations (in
order of probability) table output after train-
ing, are considered.

• Hypotheses in the n-best list are re-scored tak-
ing into consideration the information above.
Scoring cue and event is straightforward; the
words for the cue and the event are assigned
the lexical probability of being the translation
of the cue and the event in the Chinese sen-
tence by looking up the lexical translation ta-
ble. If the cue or the event do not figure as
translations of the negation cue and event in
the Chinese sentence, a score of 0 is assigned
to them.
The scope is instead scored by looping
through the words in the hypothesis; for each
such hypothesis word, the process identifies
which source-side scopeword it is most likely
to be the translation of. If no scope can be re-
trieved, a score of 0 is given for scope match-
ing. For each word the best translation proba-
bility is taken into account and these are then
summed together to score how likely is the

601



scope in the hypothesis to be the translation
of the scope in the source.

5 System

A hierarchical phrase based model (HPBM) was
trained on a corpus of 625000 (∼ 18.200.000 to-
kens) length-ratio filtered sentences. 56949 sen-
tences (∼ 9.11%) of the Chinese side and 48941
sentences (∼ 7.83%) of the English side of the
training set were found to include at least one
instance of negation. 2500 sentences were in-
stead included in the dev set to tune the log-linear
model using the MERT algorithm. 3725 sentences
from the Multiple-Translation Chinese Corpus 2.0
(LDC2002T01) were used as test set. The test
set comes divided into four sub-sets; in this paper
these sub-sets are referred as test set 1 to 4. The
source side was tokenized using the Stanford Chi-
neseWord Segmenter (Tseng et al. (2005)) and en-
coded in ‘utf-8’ so to serve as input to the system.
In order to focus on the problem of translating neg-
ative data, the 563 sentence pairs containing nega-
tion were extracted from the original test set. This
test set constitutes the true baseline improvements
will be measured upon. Reducing the number
of test sentences also eases the computation load
when involved in dependency parsing on 10.000
sentences in each n-best list. Negated sentence
were isolated by means of both regular expres-
sions and dependency parsing; this is because, as
pointed out above, the Chinese side does not flag
all negative dependencies as such.2

6 Results

6.1 Baseline
BLEU scores for the baseline systems are given in
Table 1, where the negative subset is compared to
the original (all sentences) and only positive sen-
tences conditions.
Table 2 shows instead the result for the nega-

tive baseline across three different metrics. Along
with the BLEU scores, we also took into consider-
ation an entailment-based MT evaluation metric,

2While the English dependency parser is able to iden-
tify almost all negative markers and their dependencies, the
Chinese dependency parser here deployed (the Stanford Chi-
nese Dependency parser) only captures sentences contain-
ing the adverb 不bu4. For this reason, we exploited the
list of negation adverbs included in the Chinese Propbank
(LDC2005T23) documentation and look for each of them via
regular expressions. Moreover we also looked for words con-
taining 不 as component since they are most likely to carry
negative meaning (e.g. 不久, ‘not-long’).

the RTE score3 Padó et al. (2009). The RTE score
assesses to what extent the hypothesis entails the
reference translation across a wide variety of se-
mantic and syntactic features. Another reason we
chose this metric is because it contains a feature for
polarity as well as features to check the degree of
similarity between the syntactic tree and the depen-
dencies between hypothesis and reference transla-
tion, the latter being what we used to recover the
elements of negation. We expect this metric to give
a further insight on the quality of the machine out-
put.
Baseline results are in line with the results of

Wetzel and Bond (2012), where there is a drop in
BLEU scores between positive and negative sen-
tences, and between the overall test set and the one
containing negative data only.
When analysing the results from the baseline, we
noticed that words were being deleted or moved
inappropriately when the hierarchy of phrases was
being built. This might be detrimental to the trans-
lation of negation since elements might end up out-
side the correct negation scope. The following ex-
ample illustrates this problem.

Due to unrestricted rule application, mainly
guided by the language model, the underlined
clauses containing negation on the source side
have been deleted. Moreover, the polarity of the
last clause, positive in the source, is changed into
negative in the target translation, most probably
because a negative cue is moved from somewhere
else in the sentence.
In order to solve these two problems, we exploit
the syntactic feature of the Chinese language of
grouping clauses into a single sentence. We fol-
low the intuition of Yang and Xue (2012) in using

RTE+MT score, where the RTE score is interpolated with tra-
ditional MT metrics (e.g. BLEU, NIST, TER, METEOR).

commas to guide the segmentation of a sentence
into constituent sub-clauses. Moreover, we also
use other syntactic clues to segment the test sen-
tences, including quotes in direct quotation, to re-
duce the size of the test sentences.
The constituent sub-clauses are then translated sin-
gularly and ‘stitched’ back together into the origi-
nal sentence for evaluation.

6.2 Re-ranking results
Table 3 and 4 shows the performance of the system
when n-best list re-ranking is performed. Table 3
shows the results for the oracle translation, while
Table 4 the results for actual n-best list re-ranking.
Two conditions are here compared: a short con-
dition where test sentences are chunked into con-
stituent sub-clauses prior to translation and a orig-
inal (orig.) condition where no chunking is per-
formed.
Results shows considerable improvements over

the baseline when re-ranking is performed —
an average BLEU score improvement of 1.75
points. As hypothesised, we get further improve-
ment when Chinese source sentences are translated
through their constituent sub-clauses — an aver-
age BLEU score improvement of 3.07 points. A
similar improvement is shown in Table 5 where
the original test sets comprising both positive and
negative sentences are considered. This proves the
validity of n-best list re-ranking using syntactic de-
pendencies as a method to improve the quality of
the translation of negative data. The following ex-
ample shows the improvement in detail:

Source-only re-ranking : on inflation ,

In (2) the baseline translation shows the problems
mentioned earlier, where movement leaves nega-
tion with the wrong scope, changing the overall
meaning of the sentence. Decomposing sentences
into constituent clauses and then re-ranking the
translations permits negation to retain its correct
scope so that the meaning is the same as the refer-
ence sentence.

7 Conclusion

We have presented an approach to translating neg-
ative sentences that is based on the semantics of
negation and applying it to n-best list re-ranking.

Dependency parsing and lexical translations are
here considered as easily applicable methods to
extract and translate negation related information
across different language pairs. Improvements
across different automatic evaluationmetrics show
that the above method is useful when translating
negative data. In particular, the entailment-based
RTE metric is here used as an alternative to the
BLEU score given the semantic and syntactic fea-
tures assessed, polarity included. Given the pos-
itive results, one can conclude that the problem
is neither one of data sparsity nor syntactic mis-
match.
We have also demonstrated that when dealing

with sentences containing multiple sub-clauses,
translating the constituent sub-clauses separately
and then stitching them back together before eval-
uation avoids the loss or excessive movement of
negation during decoding. This was evident in the
case of Chinese and HPBMs but there is no reason

why this does not hold also for other languages.

8 Future works

Given the validity of the present approach, future
works should be focused in extending it to differ-
ent language pairs. Also, it would be useful to re-
search more in detail into language typology and
try to devise a method which is language indepen-
dent.
Although leading to an overall improvement, n-

best list re-ranking does not always guarantee a
perfect translation. It is therefore useful in the fu-
ture to investigate ways of always ensuring that the
n-best list contains a good translation of negation
by, for instance, enriching the hypotheses list with
paraphrases. Post-editing rules can also be consid-
ered to further correct the final output.
Finally, although we can show considerable im-

provement with respect to both n-gram overlap

with the reference translation (BLEU score) and
overall semantic similarity, it remains to be de-
termined the extent to which the machine output
captures elements of negation present in the ref-
erence translation and on which system improve-
ment depends. A more targeted metric is needed,
that can effectively determine the extent to which
cue, event and scope are captured in hypothesis
translation as compared to the reference gold stan-
dard. That is the subject of current and future
work (Fancellu (2013)), which should implement
the new customized metric to include measures of
precision, recall and a F1 measure.
