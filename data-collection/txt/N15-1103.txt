Abstract

This paper gives a detailed experiment feed-
back of different approaches to adapt a sta-
tistical machine translation system towards a
targeted translation project, using only small
amounts of parallel in-domain data. The
experiments were performed by professional
translators under realistic conditions of work
using a computer assisted translation tool. We
analyze the influence of these adaptations on
the translator productivity and on the overall
post-editing effort. We show that significant
improvements can be obtained by using the
presented adaptation techniques.

1 Introduction

Language service providers (LSP) and human pro-
fessional translators currently use machine transla-
tion (MT) technology as a tool to increase their pro-
ductivity. For this, MT is closely integrated into
computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool. The MT
system suggests an automatic translation of the in-
put sentence which is then post-edited by the hu-
man professional translators. They generally work
on a project-based pace, i.e. a set of documents (the
project) have to be translated in a certain period of
time. It is well know that an MT system has to
be adapted to the target task and domain in order
to achieve the best performances. This process of
adaptation can be separated into two different steps.
First, an adaptation is performed before the begin-
ning of the translation process,. This aims to spe-
cialize the system to the targeted domain: we will to
this adaptation as domain adaptation.

Then, another adaptation is performed during the
translation process with the aim of iteratively inte-
grating users’ feedback into the MT system. The
adaptation can be performed at two different fre-
quencies: (i) the system can continuously learn from
post-edited segments, the models being immediately
updated, or (ii) all the available project-specific data
is used after each day of work to adapt the MT en-
gine. This scheme is more related to document level
adaptation; we will refer to it as project adaptation.
The experimental work described in this paper fits
into the latter adaptation scheme.

As part of the MATECAT project1, we analyze
project adaptation performed over several days. All
experiments were performed with professional hu-
man translators under realistic conditions of work.
The motivations of this work are detailed in section 2
and related work is discussed. In sections 3 and 4 we
present both the experimental protocol and frame-
work before presenting the corresponding results in
section 5.

2 Motivations

This work is a continuation of earlier research on
adaptation of a statistical MT (SMT) system Cet-
tolo et al., 2014). More precisely, it was motivated
by remaining opened questions. First, what does
the learning curve look like for an iterative usage
of the daily adaptation procedure? Even if the ef-
ficiency of the project adaptation scheme has been
established, it has not been tested yet over multiple
days. Does it reaches a plateau or do the translation

quality continue to improve? What are the causes
for the observed gains? Are they due to the famil-
iarization of the users with both the system and the
task, or are they due to real efficiency of the adap-
tation scheme? In previous work, the protocol did
not allow to clearly measure the adaptation perfor-
mance. In order to avoid this issue, a specific ex-
perimental protocol has been defined as described in
section 3. Moreover, in addition to answer these new
questions, we assessed a project adaptation scheme
which take advantage of continuous space language
modeling (CSLM) as explained in section 4. As far
as we know, this is the first time that a neural net-
work LM is integrated into a professional environ-
ment workflow, and that adaptation in such an ap-
proach is considered.

3 Evaluation Protocol

We defined an adaptation protocol with the goal
to assess the same task with and without adapta-
tion procedure. Like in (Guerberof, 2009; Plitt
and Masselot, 2010), three professional translators
were involved in a two parts experiment: during the
first part, translators receive MT suggestions from
a state-of-the-art domain-adapted engine built with
the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), without be-
ing adapted with the data generated during the trans-
lation of the project.For the second part, the MT sug-
gestions are provided by a MT system which was
previously adapted to the current project using the
human translations of prior working days. Since we
asked the same translators to post-edit the same doc-
ument twice (i.e. with and without MT adaptation),
the second run was launched after a sufficient delay:
the human memory impact is reduced since transla-
tors worked on other projects in between.

To measure the user productivity, we considered
two performance indicators: (i) the post-editing ef-
fort measured with TER (Snover et al., 2006) which
corresponds to the number of edits made individu-
ally by each translator, (ii) the time-to-edit rate ex-
pressed in number of translated words per hour. In
addition to these two key indicators, we evaluated
the translation quality using an automatic measure,
namely BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). This
measure is used to make sure that no regression in
the translation quality is observed after several days

of work due to overfitting of the project adaptation
(since previous working days are used to adapt the
models).

Moreover, in order to respect realistic working
conditions, we decided to set up a unique user-
specific Moses engine per translator. By these
means, any inter-user side-effects due to personal
choices or stylistic edits are avoided. In addition, we
obtain multiple references for assessing the results
of the test. Consequently, it was required for the as-
sessment that human translators work in a synchro-
nized manner, i.e. the same amount of data is trans-
lated every day by each translator. The systems are
then adapted, individually for each translator, using
previous days of work, and used by the translators
during the next day, and so on.

4 Experimental framework

We ran contrastive experiments by asking the trans-
lators to post-edit translations of a Legal document
from English into French (about 15k words) over
five days (i.e. about 3k words/day). An in-domain
adapted (DA) system was used as baseline system
for the first day, before project adapted (PA) systems
have taken over.

4.1 Domain adapted system

Before the human translator starts working, our DA
system is trained using an extracted subset of bilin-
gual training data that is mostly relevant to our spe-
cific domain. The extraction process, widely known
as data selection, is applied using cross-entropy
difference algorithm proposed by (Axelrod et al.,
2011)2. In order to augment the amount of train-
ing data3 (about 22M words) we also select a bilin-
gual subset from Europarl, JRC-Acquis, news com-
mentary, software manuals of the OPUS corpus,
translation memories and the United Nations cor-
pus. About 700M additional newspaper monolin-
gual data selected from WMT evaluation campaign
are also used for language modeling.

4.2 Project adapted system

Our project-adaptation scenario, which is repeated
iteratively during the lifetime of the translation

project, is achieved as follows: the new daily amount
of specific data is added to the development set, and
new monolingual and bilingual data selections are
performed with it. The new SMT system built on
these selected data is then optimized on the new de-
velopment set.

When performing project adaptation of an SMT
system, we assume that the documents of a project
are quite close and then, adapting the SMT system
using the n-th days could be helpful to translate the
n + 1 day. However, we need to be careful to not
overfit to a particular day of the project. This is par-
ticularly risky since the daily amount of specific data
is relatively small (about 3k words). Therefore, we
chose to add three times the daily data to our existing
in-domain development set. This factor of three was
empirically determined during prior lab tests. Also,
all the previous days are used, i.e. when we adapt af-
ter three days of work, we used all the data from the
first three days.

4.3 Continuous Space Language Model
Over the last years, there has been significantly in-
creasing interest in using neural networks in SMT.
As mentioned above, we used this technology into
our project adaptation scheme. Fully integrated to
the MT systems, it was used by our three SMT sys-
tems dedicated to the translators.

A continuous space LM (CSLM) (Schwenk,
2010; Schwenk, 2013) is trained on the same data
than a classical n-gram back-off LM and is used to
rescore the n-best list. In our case, and after each
day of work, the daily generated data (3k words) is
used to perform the adaptation of the CSLM by con-
tinuing its training (see (Ter-Sarkisov et al., 2014)
for details). An important advantage of this ap-
proach is that the adaptation can be performed in a
couple of minutes.

5 Experimental results and discussion

All the results presented in this section have been ex-
tracted from the edit logs provided by the MATECAT
CAT tool.

5.1 Post-editing effort
In terms of post-editing effort, the results for each
translator according to several SMT systems are
shown in Table 1. Several TER scores are computed

between the SMT system output and various sets of
references. This score reveals the number of edits
performed by the translator in order to obtain a suit-
able translation. The first column indicates the day
of the experiment. The second column represents
three SMT systems, namely: the baseline system
adapted to the domain (DA), the same system with
a CSLM (DA+CSLM) and the project adapted sys-
tem (all models were updated, including the CSLM)
noted “PA+CSLM-adapt”. The third, fourth and
fifth columns represent respectively the TER scores
for the three translators. The first score is calcu-
lated using the reference produced by the translator
himself. It could be considered as HTER (Snover
et al., 2009). The second score (in parenthesis) is
calculated using the three references produced by
the translators. The third score (in brackets) is cal-
culated according to an official “generic” reference
provided by the European Commission. By these
additional results, we aim to assess whether their is
a tendency of the systems to adapt strongly to the
particular style of one translator, or whether they still
perform well with respect to independent references.
On day 1, only the DA and DA+CSLM systems are
presented since the project adaptation can only start
after the first working day.

First of all, we can notice that the use of CSLM
significantly decrease the TER scores for all trans-
lators. We can also remark that the third translator
has a much higher TER than the two other trans-
lators during the first two days. Then, the sys-
tem seems to learn his style and the TER reaches
a comparable level at day 3. We can observe that
project adaptation always lowers the TER with re-
spect to the individual reference. The only excep-
tion can be observed for the first translator for days
2, 4 and 5. However, the project-adapted system
is better or identical in most cases when multiple
references are used. It is also interesting to note
that our adaptation procedure improves the post-
editing effort with respect to the independent refer-
ence translation in nine out of twelve cases. Overall,
it can be clearly seen that the adaptation scheme is
very effective. The difference between the baseline
system (DA+CSLM) and the fully adapted system
(PA+CSLM-adapt) reaches 9 TER points in some
conditions.

A quite similar tendency can be observed when

analyzing translation quality in terms of BLEU score
(results not presented here). Like for the prior TER
results, the BLEU scores for translator 3 are much
worse than the scores of the two other ones. After
the third day, the scores reach the same level. Again,
this could indicate that the adaptation process has
learned his particular style.

5.2 Translation speed

Table 2 reports, for each translator, the translation
speed, expressed in number of post-edited words per
hour. The results are given for the two conditions of
our experiment, along with the percentage of relative
improvement. We can observe a very high produc-
tivity gain for all translators between the two ses-
sions of our test, from 18.5% to 38.3%. The huge

gain for translator T3 could be biased by the low
working speed of the translator, even if we had con-
firmed that all the translators are experts with the
post-editing process. We assume that either T3 had
some difficulties with the legal domain or he had
just taken his time to perform the test, or both. This
could partially explain the huge improvement in pro-
ductivity which is doubled.

6 Conclusion

Several studies have also shown that the close in-
tegration of MT into a CAT tool can increase the
productivity of human translators. In this work, we
extended these works in several aspects. We have
observed systematic improvements of the translation
quality and speed when adapting the systems with
data generated during the translation project (span-
ning several days). The MT system does not only
adapt to the style of the human translator who post-
edit the automatic translations. In all cases, we ob-
served improved translation quality with respect to
an independent reference translation. Finally, we
have shown that neural network LMs can be used
in an operational SMT system and that they can be
adapted very quickly to small amount of data. Al-
though the use of neural networks in SMT is draw-
ing a lot of attention, we are not aware at any other

deployment in real applications.
