Abstract 

This paper reports on our work to 

automatically construct and populate an 

ontology of wayang (Indonesian shadow 

puppet) mythology from free text using 

relation extraction and relation clustering. A 

reference ontology is used to evaluate the 

generated ontology. The reference ontology 

contains concepts and properties within the 

wayang character domain. We examined the 

influence of corpus data variations, threshold 

value variations in the relation clustering 

process, and the usage of entity pairs or entity 

pair types during the feature extraction stages. 

The constructed ontology is examined using 

three evaluation methods, i.e. cluster purity 

(CP), instance knowledge (IK), and relation 

concept (RC). Based on the evaluation results, 

the proposed method generates the best 

ontology when using a consolidated corpus, 

the threshold value in relation clustering is 1, 

and entity pairs are used during feature 

extraction. 

1 Introduction 

As a country rich in cultural diversity, Indonesia 

certainly has an outstanding wealth of national 

culture. Wayang (shadow puppets performance 

art) is one instance of Indonesian culture that has 

cultural values and noble character. Although the 

stories are generally taken from the Mahabharata 

and Ramayana books, they involve the wisdom 

and greatness of the Indonesian culture. Wayang 

shows rely heavily on the knowledge and 

creativity of the puppeteer (dalang). Often, the 

story and knowledge about the shadow puppets 

is known only to the puppeteer and not set forth 

in writing. Such a lack of knowledge transfer 

process results in a lot of knowledge that is 

known only by the puppeteer cannot be shared to 

others, which leads to the loss of cultural 

richness. The knowledge held by the puppeteer 

ought to be propagated to future generations in 

order to be learned and developed. 

Information about the shadow puppets can be 

represented as textual data describing hundreds 

of characters. Constructing an ontology manually 

from such a large data source is time consuming 

and labor intensive. 

Work on relation extraction has already been 

conducted in the past. Initially, supervised 

learning approaches were used, for example 

feature-based supervised learning (Kambhatla, 

2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005). Some features 

that are generally used are words that lie among 

the entities, the entity type, the number of words 

between two entities, and the number of entities 

between two entities. In addition, there are 

several studies that use kernel-based approach. 

The kernel K(x, y) defines the similarity between 

objects x and y in the high-dimensional objects. 

There are various elements used to construct 

kernels such as word subsequence (Bunescu and 

Mooney, 2005) and parse trees (Zelenko et al., 

2003; Culotta et al., 2004). 

In addition, several studies use semi-

supervised learning. DIPRE (Brin, 1998) tries to 

find the relationship between the author interest 

and the book he/she had written. Snowball 

(Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) uses an 

architecture that is not very different from 

DIPRE to determine the relationship between an 

organization and its location. Meanwhile, 

Knowitall (Etzioni at al., 2005) examines relation 

extraction in heterogeneous domains of text data 

128



from the web automatically. Finally TextRunner 

(Banko at al., 2007) is a system that 

automatically searches the relationships between 

entities that exist in a corpus. This method 

produces a binary relation (e1, r, e2) where e1 and 

e2 are entities and r is a relation between them. 

Work on automatic ontology construction has 

been done by several researchers. Celjuska et al. 

(2004) developed a semi-automatic ontology 

construction system named Ontosophie. The 

system generates an ontology with the instances 

derived from unstructured text. Shamsfard et al. 

(2004) developed an automatic ontology 

construction approach which utilizes a kernel 

based method. Alani et al. (2003) tries to 

construct an ontology using data from the web. 

The system, named Artefakt, performs 

information summarization about the artist. 

Furthermore, the constructed ontology is used to 

generate personalized narrative biographies. The 

system consists of three components, namely 

knowledge extraction, information management, 

and biography construction component. 

The majority of the information extraction 

methods mentioned above require reliable NLP 

tools and resources. Unfortunately these are not 

readily available for Indonesian, the language  

our wayang data is in. To overcome this 

challenge, we employ information extraction 

methods that only require simple resources such 

as gazetteers and stopword lists, which are 

potentially used in a variety of problem domains. 

In this study, we explore methods to 

automatically construct an ontology using a 

corpus of wayang character descriptions using 

relation extraction and clustering. This method 

requires a gazetteer which contains a list of 

entities from the text. The entity types that are 

contained in the gazetteer are the name of the 

puppet characters, their kingdoms of origin, and 

their various artefacts such as weapons or spells. 

We realize our method does not yet fully 

constitute the development of a complete 

ontology, but provides an important step towards 

that direction, namely the identification of 

relations to be found within the ontology.  

2 Automatic Ontology Construction 

We aim to automatically build a wayang 

ontology from free text. The information or 

knowledge that is contained within the text is 

extracted by employing relation extraction. This 

method will extract instance candidates that are 

subsequently clustered using relation clustering. 

Furthermore, the ontology will be evaluated 

using a reference ontology to examine the quality 

of the constructed ontology. The stages of 

automatic ontology construction and evaluation 

are depicted in Figure 1. 

2.1 Automatic Ontology Construction  

During this stage, the system attempts to find all 

possible relationships that occur between any 

two entities. These relationships are further 

analysed to obtain a set of valid relationships 

between entities. The valid relations will be used 

to construct the ontology. The ontology 

construction stage is depicted in Figure 2.

The raw data is free text that consists of 

several paragraphs describing short biographies 

of wayang characters. Firstly, the free text is 

tagged using gazetteer data, i.e. a list of entities 

contained in the text. Every word contained in 

the gazetteer will be tagged in accordance to its 

entity type. The number of entities in the 

gazetteer is still general. Thus, the entities are 

subdivided into more specific groups. The entity 

group is based on Pitoyo Amrih (Amrih, 2011) 

which consists of 29 groups. In this study we 

used two tagging methods, i.e. by using a 

wayang entity that has not been detailed and by 

using detailed entities (based on the type of 

wayang entity). Different tagging treatment was 

conducted to examine whether this affects the 

ontology result or not. The example of tagged 

text using wayang entity that has not been 

detailed and detailed entities can be seen in 

Figures 3 and 4. 

Subsequently, pronoun resolution is employed 

to resolve the entity reference of a pronoun. The 

system will then perform relation extraction by 

analyzing the words occurring between tagged 

entities. This process will generate candidate 

relationship patterns between entities (X, r, Y), 

where X and Y are entities and r is the textual 

pattern that defines the relationship between the 

two entities.  

The patterns that are obtained from the 

previous process are passed on to the next step 

that is the process of eliminating irrelevant 

information, so that only valid are used in the 

next process. It runs as follows: 

1. Discard stopwords and honorifics. 
2. If there is a comma and punctuation located 

at the beginning of a pattern then the relation

is considered valid. 

3. Discard punctuation and do the trimming. 
4. If there is a pattern that is empty or exceeds 

5 words, the pattern is considered invalid. 

5. Change the pattern to lowercase. 

The result of the data in Figure 3 after this 

process can be seen in Figure 5. 

Subsequently, we perform feature extraction 

by converting the textual data into matrix form. 

This matrix contains the occurrence of candidate 

patterns between all possible pairs of entities. 

There are two types of feature extraction tried 

out in this study, i.e. based on entity pairs and 

entity type pairs. The cell in row i and column k 

of this feature matrix is the occurrence frequency 

of the ith pattern and the kth entity pair. The 

matrix form of Figure 5 when using feature 

extraction based on entity pairs is depicted in 

Figure 6. The next step is to perform relation 

clustering using semantic relational similarity as 

a similarity measure in a feature domain. The 

text patterns contained in each cluster are 

deemed to represent the same relationship. The 

clustering process will ignore candidate patterns 

that occur less than twice in the corpus. The 

result of this process is a set of clusters that each 

contains textual patterns that have a greater or 

equal similarity degree to a given threshold. The 

pseudocode of this algorithm is depicted in 

Figure 7. 

The generated clusters in this process 

comprise the relations found in the constructed 

ontology. The representative pattern, i.e. the 

candidate pattern that has the highest occurrence 

frequency within a cluster, will be used as a 

property that describes the relationship 

represented by a cluster. Suppose there is a 

cluster that contains three candidate patterns, e.g. 

“anak” (child of) with an occurrence frequency 

of 40, “putera” (son of) with an occurrence 

frequency of 30, and “mendekati” (come near to), 

with an occurrence frequency of 3. By using the 

representative pattern “anak” as a property, it is 

assigned as the relation between pairs of entities 

found within this cluster. The illustration of the 

constructed ontology after clustering is depicted 

in Figure 8.

2.2 Evaluation  

2.2.1 Reference Ontology 

To measure and ensure that the quality of the 

constructed ontology is in accordance with what 

is desired, we evaluate the constructed ontology 

against a reference ontology. The reference 

ontology acts like a “label” on the testing data in 

machine learning. The testing data label used in 

the evaluation process is used to determine how 

accurate and reliable the model established by 

machine learning is in recognizing unseen data. 

The evaluation process is performed by 

comparing the relations in the constructed 

ontology with the labeled testing data. As well as 

the data labels in machine learning, the reference 

ontology will be used to test how accurate the 

system is able to generate ontology from free text. 

We define several ontology components that 

can be obtained from the knowledge of a 

particular topic. This knowledge is obtained by 

looking at the types of entities and relations 

among them. It can also be obtained by looking 

at the group/category of any entity in the text. 

Each group/category defines the entity 

relationship that will occur between one entity to 

another one.  

The ontology components which are defined 

in the reference ontology are concept and 

property. An illustration of the relationship 

between concept and property can be seen in 

Figures 9 and 10. A concept is something that is 

described in the ontology and it can be one of: 

objects, category or class. Concepts in the 

reference ontology are entities that are 

incorporated within the gazetteer categories i.e. 

puppet character, spell, weapons, and nations.  

The ontology property describes the 

relationship between one concept to another. By 

observing the entity and relationship between 

them we can obtain the potential properties. For 

example, there are several entity groups, e.g. 

puppet character, kingdoms, weapons, and spell. 

Between each group there is the relationship that 

may occur. This relationship may occur between 

entities within the group/category or among 

entities contained in different group/categories. 

In this reference ontology, the authors define 

certain properties that potentially appear in the 

text. There are 14 properties which consist of 11 

properties describing the relationship between 

person and person, 1 property describing the 

relationship between person and country, 1 

property describing the relationship between 

person and weapon, and 1 property describing 

the relationship between person and spell. The 

relationship between concepts in the reference 

ontology is depicted in Figure 11. 

2.2.2 Evaluation method 

After relation clustering, each cluster is grouped 

based on the reference ontology property. This 

grouping is performed based on the synonym of 

the representative pattern on particular cluster 

and the property of reference ontology. If the 

representative pattern does not match (i.e. does 

not contain a synonym) with the ontology 

reference property then it is ignored. 

In this research we use three evaluation 

methods i.e. cluster purity, instances of 

knowledge, and relations concept. 

1. Cluster Purity (CP) 

Cluster purity (CP) is the ratio between the

property in ontology

property relation

concept in a reference ontology 

132



number of representative patterns and the 

number of all patterns in a cluster. Cluster Purity 

(CP) calculation ignores singleton clusters, i.e. 

when there is only one pattern in a cluster. It can 

be formulated as seen below: 

CP = 
j

j
N 1

1
 

where Ω (Ω1, Ω2, ..., Ωj) is the set of 

representative patterns for each cluster and N is 

the number of patterns in a set of clusters. 

Each cluster contains textual patterns and its 

occurrence frequency. For example, the result of 

relation clustering can be seen below.  

Cluster 1

Cluster 2 raja 3 

Cluster 3 negara 24

2. Instances Knowledge (IK) 

Instances Knowledge (IK) evaluation is intended 

to measure the information degree on each 

property. There is the possibility that the 

relationship among two entities is valid but the 

knowledge therein is not as expected. This 

evaluation is performed by conducting queries of 

multiple instance samples. The queries are 

instance samples that have valid knowledge and 

are taken randomly from the corpus for each 

property. It can be formulated as seen below: 

IK (Propi) = 

N

Avg

where Propi is the i
th
 property, j is a query for the 

ith property, and N is the number of queries for 

the ith property. 

For example, there are 6 instances for 

property anak (child of). The instances are 

Kakrasana putra Basudewa , Werkudara putra 

Pandu., Kakrasana anak Baladewa, Rupakenca 

putra Palasara, Basukesti negara  Wirata, and 

Dandunwacana negara  Jodipati. 

Then there are 5 queries for this property i.e. 

Kakrasana putra Basudewa, Werkudara anak 

Pandu, Arjuna putra Pandu, Rupakenca putra 

Palasara, and Aswatama anak Durna. 

Based on that query, 3 instances are valid (1

) and the rest is invalid. Thus, the IK value 

is 
%60

3. Relation Concept (RC) 

Relation Concept is a measure to examine the 

valid relations in each property. A valid relation 

is an instance that has an appropriate relationship 

with the defined property in the reference 

ontology. This evaluation can be formulated 

below:  

(RC (Propi) = 
j

Pr

where Propi is the i
th

 property , )(
Pr iop

jIvalid  is 

the valid instances of the ith property, and N is 

the number of pattern. 

For example, there are 6 instances for 

property anak (child of). The instances are 

Kakrasana putra Basudewa ,Werkudara putra 

Pandu, Kakrasana anak Baladewa, Rupakenca 

putra Palasara, Basukesti negara Wirata and 

Dandunwacana negara  Jodipati. 

There are 4 instances (1

) that are 

appropriate and 2 instance (5

) that are not 

appropriate to property anak (child of). So that, 

the RC value is

3 Experimental Data and Setup 

In this research we obtain our raw web data from 

two separate sources: ki-demang.com and 

Wikipedia. Ki-demang.com is a website that 

contains various Javanese culture such as 

wayang, gamelan (Javanese orchestra), Javanese 

songs, Javanese calendar and Javanese literature. 

Meanwhile Wikipedia is the largest online 

encyclopedia, it provides a summary of 

Ramayana and Mahabharata characters.  

In this study, we will only use corpora in the 

Indonesian language, and use 3 types of corpora, 

namely ki-demang corpus (derived from ki-

demang.com), Wikipedia corpus (derived from 

id.wikipedia.org) and consolidated corpus 

(combination of ki-demang and Wikipedia 

corpus).   

Ki-demang corpus is containing wayang 

character annotations according to Javanese 

cultural community. The ki-demang corpus 

133



writing and spelling is not as good as the 

Wikipedia corpus. Punctuation and spelling 

errors frequently occur, as well as fairly complex 

sentence structures. This corpus consists of 363 

wayang characters; where there are 187 puppet 

characters that have annotations and 176 puppet 

characters that do not have annotations. 

The Wikipedia corpus has substances of 

wayang character annotation from the 

Mahabaratha and the Ramayana book and it also 

contains the description of particular characters 

in Indonesian culture. The Wikipedia corpus 

consists of 180 puppet characters, which all have 

their respective annotations.  

The last corpus is a combination of ki-demang 

and Wikipedia corpus. Merging data from both 

corpora is expected to enrich the annotation of 

wayang characters. Combining these data led to 

two perspectives in wayang character annotation, 

which is based on Mahabaratha/Ramayana book 

and based on the Javanese culture community. 

In this study, we will perform some 

experiments to examine the influence of various 

parameters. The parameters include the 

corpus data variety, the threshold value in the 

clustering process, and the usage of entity pair or 

entity type pair during feature extraction. 

4 Result and Analysis 

We conduct experiments for various parameters. 

The constructed ontology is evaluated using 

cluster purity (CP), instances knowledge (IK), 

and relation concept (RC).  The experiment 

results and details of various parameters can be 

seen in Figures 12 and 13.  

For the first experiment we want to evaluate 

the corpus variation. The objective of this 

experiment is to find the most representative 

corpus used in ontology construction. Based on 

the experiment, when the system is employing 

entity type pairs in feature extraction, ki-demang 

corpus has a high CP (76.54%) rate and a lower 

IK (11.49%) and RC (44.8%) rate. When the CP 

rate is high, it means that the pattern variation in 

particular cluster is modest and tends to be a 

singleton (only one pattern in a cluster). It is the 

impact of the information homogeneity of ki-

demang corpus compared to the other corpora. 

The IK and RC rate of Wikipedia corpus and 

consolidated corpus is better than ki-demang 

corpus. The Wikipedia corpus has better 

information content compared to the ki-demang 

corpus, thus the consolidated corpus has a better 

RC and IK rate compared to individual corpora. 

Meanwhile, when the system employs entity 

pairs during feature extraction stage, the the 

consolidated corpus has a fairly better result 

compare to single corpus. It means that the 

consolidated corpus has richer information than 

ki-demang or Wikipedia corpus. 

The second experiment was conducted to 

evaluate the threshold value in clustering process. 

The objective of this experiment is to find the 

best threshold value for relation clustering. For 

further analysis in a corpus variation, we used 

the average value of cluster purity (CP), 

instances knowledge (IK) and relation concept 

(RC) for all corpora. When the system employs 

entity type pairs during feature extraction, the CP 

rate is 97.15%, IK rate is 49.43%, and RC rate is 

          Threshold

64.41% for threshold value is 1. This result is 

always higher than using other threshold value.  

Hereafter, when the system employs entity 

pairs during feature extraction, the CP rate is 

98.14%, the IK rate is 49.43%, and RC rate is 

64.41% for threshold value is 1. Given the 

experiment result, it is clear that a threshold 

value of 1 always gives a better result than the 

other threshold values. The higher pattern 

similarity in a cluster will yield a better 

constructed ontology result. 

The last experiment was conducted to 

evaluate the consequence of using entity pairs or 

entity type pairs during feature extraction to the 

constructed ontology. For further analysis in a  

feature extraction variation, we used the average 

value of cluster purity (CP), instances knowledge 

(IK) and relation concept (RC) for all threshold 

value in a clustering process.. Based on the 

experiment result above, the usage of entity pairs 

in feature extraction always brings a better result 

than the entity type pairs. When using entity type 

pairs in feature extraction, it will reduce some 

detail of extracted feature. The feature only 

describes the relationship of entity type, not the 

entity itself. This leads to suboptimally 

constructed ontologies. 

5 Conclusion 

This paper presented a model for automatic 

ontology construction from free text. Firstly, 

relation extraction is used to retrieve the 

candidate patterns. Furthermore, relation 

clustering is used to group relations that have the 

same semantic tendency. An experiment has 

been carried out on various parameters such as 

on the corpus variety, the threshold value in 

relation clustering process, the usage of simple 

process for eliminating irrelevant information 

and the usage of entity pairs or entity type pairs 

during feature extraction. 

Based on the experimental result, the 

consolidated corpus (combination of ki-demang 

and Wikipedia corpus) is most beneficial in 

ontology construction. By integrating the corpus, 

it will increase the information quality which 

yields a better result. Meanwhile for the other 

parameters, the most beneficial result is obtained 

when using 1 as a threshold value in clustering 

process, and using entity pairs during feature 

extraction. The higher pattern similarity in a 

cluster will yield a better resulting ontology. 

Furthermore, simple processing is employed to 

remove some punctuation, stopwords and 

honorifics which are a source of noise in the 

extracted patterns. The usage of entity type pairs 

during feature extraction will result in reduced or 

lost detail of pattern features and bring a 

detrimental consequence to the ontology result.
