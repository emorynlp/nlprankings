Abstract

In this paper, we dedicate to the topic of aspect
ranking, which aims to automatically identify
important product aspects from online con-
sumer reviews. The important aspects are
identified according to two observations: (a)
the important aspects of a product are usually
commented by a large number of consumers;
and (b) consumers’ opinions on the important
aspects greatly influence their overall opin-
ions on the product. In particular, given con-
sumer reviews of a product, we first identify
the product aspects by a shallow dependency
parser and determine consumers’ opinions on
these aspects via a sentiment classifier. We
then develop an aspect ranking algorithm to
identify the important aspects by simultane-
ously considering the aspect frequency and
the influence of consumers’ opinions given to
each aspect on their overall opinions. The ex-
perimental results on 11 popular products in
four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. We further apply the aspect
ranking results to the application of document-
level sentiment classification, and improve the
performance significantly.

1 Introduction

The rapidly expanding e-commerce has facilitated
consumers to purchase products online. More than
$156 million online product retail sales have been
done in the US market during 2009 (Forrester Re-
search, 2009). Most retail Web sites encourage con-
sumers to write reviews to express their opinions on
various aspects of the products. This gives rise to

Figure 1: Sample reviews on iPhone 3GS product

huge collections of consumer reviews on the Web.
These reviews have become an important resource
for both consumers and firms. Consumers com-
monly seek quality information from online con-
sumer reviews prior to purchasing a product, while
many firms use online consumer reviews as an im-
portant resource in their product development, mar-
keting, and consumer relationship management. As
illustrated in Figure 1, most online reviews express
consumers’ overall opinion ratings on the product,
and their opinions on multiple aspects of the prod-
uct. While a product may have hundreds of aspects,
we argue that some aspects are more important than
the others and have greater influence on consumers’
purchase decisions as well as firms’ product devel-
opment strategies. Take iPhone 3GS as an exam-
ple, some aspects like “battery” and “speed,” are
more important than the others like “moisture sen-
sor.” Generally, identifying the important product
aspects will benefit both consumers and firms. Con-
sumers can conveniently make wise purchase deci-
sion by paying attentions on the important aspects,
while firms can focus on improving the quality of

1496



these aspects and thus enhance the product reputa-
tion effectively. However, it is impractical for people
to identify the important aspects from the numerous
reviews manually. Thus, it becomes a compelling
need to automatically identify the important aspects
from consumer reviews.

A straightforward solution for important aspect
identification is to select the aspects that are fre-
quently commented in consumer reviews as the im-
portant ones. However, consumers’ opinions on
the frequent aspects may not influence their over-
all opinions on the product, and thus not influence
consumers’ purchase decisions. For example, most
consumers frequently criticize the bad “signal con-
nection” of iPhone 4, but they may still give high
overall ratings to iPhone 4. On the other hand,
some aspects, such as “design” and “speed,” may not
be frequently commented, but usually more impor-
tant than “signal connection.” Hence, the frequency-
based solution is not able to identify the truly impor-
tant aspects.

Motivated by the above observations, in this pa-
per, we propose an effective approach to automat-
ically identify the important product aspects from
consumer reviews. Our assumption is that the
important aspects of a product should be the as-
pects that are frequently commented by consumers,
and consumers’ opinions on the important aspects
greatly influence their overall opinions on the prod-
uct. Given the online consumer reviews of a spe-
cific product, we first identify the aspects in the re-
views using a shallow dependency parser (Wu et al.,
2009), and determine consumers’ opinions on these
aspects via a sentiment classifier. We then design an
aspect ranking algorithm to identify the important
aspects by simultaneously taking into account the
aspect frequency and the influence of consumers’
opinions given to each aspect on their overall opin-
ions. Specifically, we assume that consumer’s over-
all opinion rating on a product is generated based
on a weighted sum of his/her specific opinions on
multiple aspects of the product, where the weights
essentially measure the degree of importance of the
aspects. A probabilistic regression algorithm is then
developed to derive these importance weights by
leveraging the aspect frequency and the consistency
between the overall opinions and the weighted sum
of opinions on various aspects. We conduct ex-

periments on 11 popular products in four domains.
The consumer reviews on these products are crawled
from the prevalent forum Web sites (e.g., cnet.com
and viewpoint.com etc.) More details of our review
corpus are discussed in Section 3. The experimen-
tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-
proach on important aspects identification. Further-
more, we apply the aspect ranking results to the ap-
plication of document-level sentiment classification
by carrying out the term-weighting based on the as-
pect importance. The results show that our approach
can improve the performance significantly.

The main contributions of this paper include,
1) We dedicate to the topic of aspect ranking,

which aims to automatically identify important as-
pects of a product from consumer reviews.

2) We develop an aspect ranking algorithm to
identify the important aspects by simultaneously
considering the aspect frequency and the influence
of consumers’ opinions given to each aspect on their
overall opinions.

3) We apply aspect ranking results to the applica-
tion of document-level sentiment classification, and
improve the performance significantly.

There is another work named aspect ranking
(Snyder et al., 2007). The task in this work is differ-
ent from ours. This work mainly focuses on predict-
ing opinionated ratings on aspects rather than iden-
tifying important aspects.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 elaborates our aspect ranking approach. Sec-
tion 3 presents the experimental results, while Sec-
tion 4 introduces the application of document-level
sentiment classification. Section 5 reviews related
work and Section 6 concludes this paper with future
works.

2 Aspect Ranking Framework

In this section, we first present some notations and
then elaborate the key components of our approach,
including the aspect identification, sentiment classi-
fication, and aspect ranking algorithm.

2.1 Notations and Problem Formulation

Let R = {r1, · · · , r|R|} denotes a set of online con-
sumer reviews of a specific product. Each review
r ∈ R is associated with an overall opinion rating

1497



Or, and covers several aspects with consumer com-
ments on these aspects. Suppose there are m aspects
A = {a1, · · · , am} involved in the review corpus
R, where ak is the k-th aspect. We define ork as the
opinion on aspect ak in review r. We assume that
the overall opinion rating Or is generated based on
a weighted sum of the opinions on specific aspects
ork (Wang et al., 2010). The weights are denoted as
{ωrk}mk=1, each of which essentially measures the
degree of importance of the aspect ak in review r.
Our task is to derive the important weights of as-
pects, and identify the important aspects.

Next, we will introduce the key components of
our approach, including aspect identification that
identifies the aspects ak in each review r, aspect sen-
timent classification which determines consumers’
opinions ork on various aspects, and aspect ranking
algorithm that identifies the important aspects.

2.2 Aspect Identification

As illustrated in Figure 1, there are usually two types
of reviews, Pros and Cons review and free text re-
views on the Web. For Pros and Cons reviews, the
aspects are identified as the frequent noun terms in
the reviews, since the aspects are usually noun or
noun phrases (Liu, 2009), and it has been shown
that simply extracting the frequent noun terms from
the Pros and Cons reviews can get high accurate
aspect terms (Liu el al., 2005). To identify the as-
pects in free text reviews, we first parse each review
using the Stanford parser 1, and extract the noun
phrases (NP) from the parsing tree as aspect can-
didates. While these candidates may contain much
noise, we leverage the Pros and Cons reviews to
assist identify aspects from the candidates. In par-
ticular, we explore the frequent noun terms in Pros
and Cons reviews as features, and train a one-class
SVM (Manevitz et al., 2002) to identify aspects in
the candidates. While the obtained aspects may con-
tain some synonym terms, such as “earphone” and
“headphone,” we further perform synonym cluster-
ing to get unique aspects. Specifically, we first ex-
pand each aspect term with its synonym terms ob-
tained from the synonym terms Web site 2, and then
cluster the terms to obtain unique aspects based on

unigram feature.

2.3 Aspect Sentiment Classification
Since the Pros and Cons reviews explicitly express
positive and negative opinions on the aspects, re-
spectively, our task is to determine the opinions in
free text reviews. To this end, we here utilize Pros
and Cons reviews to train a SVM sentiment classifier.
Specifically, we collect sentiment terms in the Pros
and Cons reviews as features and represent each re-
view into feature vector using Boolean weighting.
Note that we select sentiment terms as those appear
in the sentiment lexicon provided by MPQA project
(Wilson et al., 2005). With these features, we then
train a SVM classifier based on Pros and Cons re-
views. Given a free text review, since it may cover
various opinions on multiple aspects, we first locate
the opinionated expression modifying each aspect,
and determine the opinion on the aspect using the
learned SVM classifier. In particular, since the opin-
ionated expression on each aspect tends to contain
sentiment terms and appear closely to the aspect (Hu
and Liu, 2004), we select the expressions which con-
tain sentiment terms and are at the distance of less
than 5 from the aspect NP in the parsing tree.

2.4 Aspect Ranking
Generally, consumer’s opinion on each specific as-
pect in the review influences his/her overall opin-
ion on the product. Thus, we assume that the con-
sumer gives the overall opinion rating Or based on
the weighted sum of his/her opinion ork on each as-
pect ak:

∑m
k=1 ωrkork, which can be rewritten as

ωr
T or, where ωr and or are the weight and opinion

vectors. Inspired by the work of Wang et al. (2010),
we viewOr as a sample drawn from a Gaussian Dis-
tribution, with mean ωrT or and variance σ2,

p(Or) =
1√

2πσ2
exp[−(Or − ωr

T or)
2

2σ2
]. (1)

To model the uncertainty of the importance
weights ωr in each review, we assume ωr as a sam-
ple drawn from a Multivariate Gaussian Distribu-
tion, with µ as the mean vector and Σ as the covari-
ance matrix,

p(ωr) =
1

(2π)n/2|Σ|1/2
exp[−1

2
(ωr − µ)T Σ−1(ωr − µ)].

(2)

1498



We further incorporate aspect frequency as a prior
knowledge to define the distribution of µ and Σ.
Specifically, the distribution of µ and Σ is defined
based on its Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to a
prior distribution with a mean vector µ0 and an iden-
tity covariance matrix I in Eq.3. Each element in µ0
is defined as the frequency of the corresponding as-
pect: frequency(ak)/

∑m
i=1 frequency(ai).

p(µ,Σ) = exp[−φ ·KL(Q(µ,Σ)||Q(µ0, I))],
(3)

where KL(·, ·) is the KL divergence, Q(µ,Σ) de-
notes a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution, and φ is
a tradeoff parameter.

Base on the above definition, the probability of
generating the overall opinion rating Or on review r
is given as,

p(Or|Ψ, r) =
∫

p(Or|ωrT or, σ2)
· p(ωr|µ,Σ) · p(µ,Σ)dωr,

(4)

where Ψ = {ω, µ,Σ, σ2} are the model parameters.
Next, we utilize Maximum Log-likelihood (ML)

to estimate the model parameters given the con-
sumer reviews corpus. In particular, we aim to find
an optimal Ψ̂ to maximize the probability of observ-
ing the overall opinion ratings in the reviews corpus.

Ψ̂ = arg max

(5)
For the sake of simplicity, we denote the objective
function

∑
r∈R log(p(Or|Ψ, r)) as Γ(Ψ).

The derivative of the objective function with re-
spect to each model parameter vanishes at the mini-
mizer:

(13)
We can see that the above parameters are involved

in each other’s solution. We here utilize Alternating
Optimization technique to derive the optimal param-
eters in an iterative manner. We first hold the param-
eters µ, Σ and σ2 fixed and update the parameters
ωr for each review r ∈ R. Then, we update the
parameters µ, Σ and σ2 with fixed ωr (r ∈ R).
These two steps are alternatively iterated until the
Eq.5 converges. As a result, we obtain the optimal
importance weights ωr which measure the impor-
tance of aspects in review r ∈ R. We then compute
the final importance score ϖk for each aspect ak by
integrating its importance score in all the reviews as,

ϖk =
1

|R|
∑

r∈R
ωrk, k = 1, · · · , m (14)

It is worth noting that the aspect frequency is con-
sidered again in this integration process. According
to the importance score ϖk, we can identify impor-
tant aspects.

3 Evaluations

In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on aspect identification, sentiment classi-
fication, and aspect ranking.

3.1 Data and Experimental Setting
The details of our product review data set is given
in Table 1. This data set contains consumer reviews
on 11 popular products in 4 domains. These reviews
were crawled from the prevalent forum Web sites,
including cnet.com, viewpoints.com, reevoo.com
and gsmarena.com. All of the reviews were posted

1499



between June, 2009 and Sep 2010. The aspects of
the reviews, as well as the opinions on the aspects
were manually annotated as the gold standard for
evaluations.

Table 1: Statistics of the Data Sets, # denotes the size of
the reviews/sentences.

To examine the performance on aspect identifi-
cation and sentiment classification, we employed
F1-measure, which was the combination of preci-
sion and recall, as the evaluation metric. To evalu-
ate the performance on aspect ranking, we adopted
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at top k
(NDCG@k) (Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2002) as the
performance metric. Given an aspect ranking list
a1, · · · , ak, NDCG@k is calculated by

NDCG@k =
1

Z

k∑
i=1

2t(i) − 1
log(1 + i)

, (15)

where t(i) is the function that represents the reward
given to the aspect at position i, Z is a normaliza-
tion term derived from the top k aspects of a perfect
ranking, so as to normalize NDCG@k to be within
[0, 1]. This evaluation metric will favor the ranking
which ranks the most important aspects at the top.
For the reward t(i), we labeled each aspect as one of
the three scores: Un-important (score 1), Ordinary
(score 2) and Important (score 3). Three volunteers
were invited in the annotation process as follows.
We first collected the top k aspects in all the rank-
ings produced by various evaluated methods (maxi-
mum k is 15 in our experiment). We then sampled
some reviews covering these aspects, and provided
the reviews to each annotator to read. Each review
contains the overall opinion rating, the highlighted
aspects, and opinion terms. Afterward, the annota-
tors were required to assign an importance score to
each aspect. Finally, we took the average of their
scorings as the corresponding importance scores of
the aspects. In addition, there is only one parameter

φ that needs to be tuned in our approach. Through-
out the experiments, we empirically set φ as 0.001.

3.2 Evaluations on Aspect Identification

We compared our aspect identification approach
against two baselines: a) the method proposed by
Hu and Liu (2004), which was based on the asso-
ciation rule mining, and b) the method proposed by
Wu et al. (2009), which was based on a dependency
parser.

The results are presented in Table 2. On average,
our approach significantly outperforms Hu’s method
and Wu’ method in terms of F1-measure by over
5.87% and 3.27%, respectively. In particular, our
approach obtains high precision. Such results imply
that our approach can accurately identify the aspects
from consumer reviews by leveraging the Pros and
Cons reviews.

cant t-test, p-values<0.05.

3.3 Evaluations on Sentiment Classification

In this experiment, we implemented the follow-
ing sentiment classification methods (Pang and Lee,
2008):
1) Unsupervised method. We employed one un-
supervised method which was based on opinion-
ated term counting via SentiWordNet (Ohana et al.,
2009).
2) Supervised method. We employed three su-
pervised methods proposed in Pang et al. (2002),
including Naı̈ve Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy
(ME), SVM. These classifiers were trained based on
the Pros and Cons reviews as described in Section
2.3.

1500



The comparison results are showed in Table 3. We
can see that supervised methods significantly outper-
form unsupervised method. For example, the SVM
classifier outperforms the unsupervised method in
terms of average F1-measure by over 10.37%. Thus,
we can deduce from such results that the Pros and
Cons reviews are useful for sentiment classification.
In addition, among the supervised classifiers, SVM
classifier performs the best in most products, which
is consistent with the previous research (Pang et al.,
2002).

3.4 Evaluations on Aspect Ranking
In this section, we compared our aspect ranking al-
gorithm against the following three methods.

1) Frequency-based method. The method ranks
the aspects based on aspect frequency.

2) Correlation-based method. This method mea-
sures the correlation between the opinions on spe-
cific aspects and the overall opinion. It counts the
number of the cases when such two kinds of opin-
ions are consistent, and ranks the aspects based on
the number of the consistent cases.

3) Hybrid method. This method captures both the
aspect frequency and correlation by a linear combi-
nation, as λ· Frequency-based Ranking + (1 − λ)·
Correlation-based Ranking, where λ is set to 0.5.

The comparison results are showed in Table 4. On
average, our approach outperforms the frequency-
based method, correlation-based method, and hy-
brid method in terms of NDCG@5 by over 6.24%,

5.79% and 5.56%, respectively. It improves the
performance over such three methods in terms of
NDCG@10 by over 3.47%, 2.94% and 2.58%, re-
spectively, while in terms of NDCG@15 by over
4.08%, 3.04% and 3.49%, respectively. We can de-
duce from the results that our aspect ranking algo-
rithm can effectively identify the important aspects
from consumer reviews by leveraging the aspect fre-
quency and the influence of consumers’ opinions
given to each aspect on their overall opinions. Ta-
ble 5 shows the aspect ranking results of these four
methods. Due to the space limitation, we here only
show top 10 aspects of the product iphone 3GS. We
can see that our approach performs better than the
others. For example, the aspect “phone” is ranked at
the top by the other methods. However, “phone” is
a general but not important aspect.

6 Feature Looking Looking Storage
7 Looking Feature Feature Price
8 Battery Screen Battery Software
9 Screen Battery Screen Camera
10 Flash Bluetooth Flash Call quality

Table 5: iPhone 3GS Aspect Ranking Results.

To further investigate the reasonability of our
ranking results, we refer to one of the public user
feedback reports, the “china unicom 100 customers
iPhone user feedback report” (Chinaunicom Report,
2009). The report demonstrates that the top four as-
pects of iPhone product, which users most concern
with, are “3G Network” (30%), “usability” (30%),
“out-looking design” (26%), “application” (15%).
All of these aspects are in the top 10 of our rank-
ing results.

Therefore, we can conclude that our approach is
able to automatically identify the important aspects
from numerous consumer reviews.

4 Applications

The identification of important aspects can support
a wide range of applications. For example, we can

provide product comparison on the important as-
pects to users, so that users can make wise purchase
decisions conveniently.

In the following, we apply the aspect ranking re-
sults to assist document-level review sentiment clas-
sification. Generally, a review document contains
consumer’s positive/negative opinions on various as-
pects of the product. It is difficult to get the ac-
curate overall opinion of the whole review without
knowing the importance of these aspects. In ad-
dition, when we learn a document-level sentiment
classifier, the features generated from unimportant
aspects lack of discriminability and thus may dete-
riorate the performance of the classifier (Fang et al.,
2010). While the important aspects and the senti-
ment terms on these aspects can greatly influence the
overall opinions of the review, they are highly likely
to be discriminative features for sentiment classifica-
tion. These observations motivate us to utilize aspect
ranking results to assist classifying the sentiment of
review documents.

Specifically, we randomly sampled 100 reviews of
each product as the testing data and used the remain-
ing reviews as the training data. We first utilized our
approach to identify the importance aspects from the
training data. We then explored the aspect terms and
sentiment terms as features, based on which each re-
view is represented as a feature vector. Here, we
give more emphasis on the important aspects and
the sentiment terms that modify these aspects. In
particular, we set the term-weighting as 1 + φ ·ϖk,
where ϖk is the importance score of the aspect ak,

φ is set to 100. Based on the weighted features, we
then trained a SVM classifier using the training re-
views to determine the overall opinions on the test-
ing reviews. For the performance comparison, we
compared our approach against two baselines, in-
cluding Boolean weighting method and frequency
weighting (tf ) method (Paltoglou et al., 2010) that
do not utilize the importance of aspects. The com-
parison results are shown in Table 6. We can see
that our approach (IA) significantly outperforms the
other methods in terms of average F1-measure by
over 2.79% and 4.07%, respectively. The results
also show that the Boolean weighting method out-
performs the frequency weighting method in terms
of average F1-measure by over 1.25%, which are
consistent with the previous research by Pang et al.
(2002). On the other hand, from the IA weight-
ing formula, we observe that without using the im-
portant aspects, our term-weighting function will be
equal to Boolean weighting. Thus, we can speculate
that the identification of important aspects is ben-
eficial to improving the performance of document-
level sentiment classification.

been extensively studied (Pang and Lee, 2008). Ear-
lier research had been studied unsupervised (Kim et
al., 2004), supervised (Pang et al., 2002; Pang et al.,
2005) and semi-supervised approaches (Goldberg et
al., 2006) for the classification. For example, Mullen
et al. (2004) proposed an unsupervised classifica-
tion method which exploited pointwise mutual in-
formation (PMI) with syntactic relations and other
attributes. Pang et al. (2002) explored several ma-
chine learning classifiers, including Naı̈ve Bayes,
Maximum Entropy, SVM, for sentiment classifica-
tion. Goldberg et al. (2006) classified the sentiment
of the review using the graph-based semi-supervised
learning techniques, while Li el al. (2009) tackled
the problem using matrix factorization techniques
with lexical prior knowledge.

Since the consumer reviews usually expressed
opinions on multiple aspects, some works had
drilled down to the aspect-level sentiment analysis,
which aimed to identify the aspects from the reviews
and to determine the opinions on the specific aspects
instead of the overall opinion. For the topic of aspect
identification, Hu and Liu (2004) presented the asso-
ciation mining method to extract the frequent terms
as the aspects. Subsequently, Popescu et al. (2005)
proposed their system OPINE, which extracted the
aspects based on the KnowItAll Web information
extraction system (Etzioni et al., 2005). Liu el al.
(2005) proposed a supervised method based on lan-
guage pattern mining to identify the aspects in the
reviews. Later, Mei et al. (2007) proposed a prob-
abilistic topic model to capture the mixture of as-

pects and sentiments simultaneously. Afterwards,
Wu et al. (2009) utilized the dependency parser to
extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the
reviews as the aspect candidates. They then trained
a language model to refine the candidate set, and
to obtain the aspects. On the other hand, for the
topic of sentiment classification on the specific as-
pect, Snyder et al. (2007) considered the situation
when the consumers’ opinions on one aspect could
influence their opinions on others. They thus built
a graph to analyze the meta-relations between opin-
ions, such as agreement and contrast. And they pro-
posed a Good Grief algorithm to leveraging such
meta-relations to improve the prediction accuracy
of aspect opinion ratings. In addition, Wang et al.
(2010) proposed the topic of latent aspect rating
which aimed to infer the opinion rating on the as-
pect. They first employed a bootstrapping-based al-
gorithm to identify the major aspects via a few seed
word aspects. They then proposed a generative La-
tent Rating Regression model (LRR) to infer aspect
opinion ratings based on the review content and the
associated overall rating.

While there were usually huge collection of re-
views, some works had concerned the topic of
aspect-based sentiment summarization to combat
the information overload. They aimed to summa-
rize all the reviews and integrate major opinions on
various aspects for a given product. For example,
Titov et al. (2008) explored a topic modeling method
to generate a summary based on multiple aspects.
They utilized topics to describe aspects and incor-

1503



porated a regression model fed by the ground-truth
opinion ratings. Additionally, Lu el al. (2009) pro-
posed a structured PLSA method, which modeled
the dependency structure of terms, to extract the as-
pects in the reviews. They then aggregated opinions
on each specific aspects and selected representative
text segment to generate a summary.

In addition, some works proposed the topic of
product ranking which aimed to identify the best
products for each specific aspect (Zhang et al.,
2010). They used a PageRank style algorithm to
mine the aspect-opinion graph, and to rank the prod-
ucts for each aspect.

Different from previous researches, we dedicate
our work to identifying the important aspects from
the consumer reviews of a specific product.

6 Conclusions and Future Works

In this paper, we have proposed to identify the im-
portant aspects of a product from online consumer
reviews. Our assumption is that the important as-
pects of a product should be the aspects that are fre-
quently commented by consumers and consumers’
opinions on the important aspects greatly influence
their overall opinions on the product. Based on this
assumption, we have developed an aspect ranking al-
gorithm to identify the important aspects by simulta-
neously considering the aspect frequency and the in-
fluence of consumers’ opinions given to each aspect
on their overall opinions. We have conducted exper-
iments on 11 popular products in four domains. Ex-
perimental results have demonstrated the effective-
ness of our approach on important aspects identifi-
cation. We have further applied the aspect ranking
results to the application of document-level senti-
ment classification, and have significantly improved
the classification performance. In the future, we will
apply our approach to support other applications.
