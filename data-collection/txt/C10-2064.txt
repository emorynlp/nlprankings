Abstract 

The  realization  of  singular  count  nouns 
without an accompanying determiner in-
side  a  PP  (determinerless  PP,  bare  PP, 
Preposition-Noun  Combination)  has  re-
cently attracted some interest in computa-
tional linguistics. Yet, the relevant factors 
for  determiner  omission  remain  unclear, 
and  conditions  for  determiner  omission 
vary from language to language. We pre-
sent a logistic regression model of deter-
miner omission in German based on data 
obtained  by  applying  annotation  mining 
to  a  large,  automatically  and  manually 
annotated corpus.  

1  The problem and how to deal with it 
Preposition-Noun  Combinations  (PNCs,  some-
times  called  determinerless  PPs  or  bare  PPs) 
minimally  consist  of  a  preposition  and  a  count 
noun in the singular that – despite requirements 
formulated  elsewhere  in  the  grammar  of  the  re-
spective  language  –  appears  without  a  deter-
miner.  The  noun  in  a  PNC  can  be  extended 
through  prenominal  modification  (1)  and  post-
nominal complementation (2). Still, a determiner 
is  missing.  The  following  examples  are  given 
from German. 
(1)  auf parlamentarische Anfrage (‘after being 
asked in parliament’), mit beladenem Ruck-
sack (‘with loaded backpack’), unter sanfter 
Androhung (‘under gentle threat’)  

(2)  Er wehrt sich gegen die Forderung nach  
he defies REFL against the demand for  
Stilllegung einer Verbrennungsanlage. 
closedown an  incineration plant 
‘He defies the demand for closing an inciner-
ation plant.’ 

PNCs  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  languages 
(Himmelmann,  1998);  the  conditions  for  deter-
miner omission, however, have not been detected 
yet, and conditions applying to one language do 
not  carry  over  to  other  languages.  In  addition, 
speakers only reluctantly judge the acceptability 
of newly coined PNCs, so that reliance to intro-
spective judgments cannot be assumed. 

For  English,  Stvan  (1998)  and  Baldwin  et  al. 
(2006) have claimed that either the semantics of 
the preposition or of the noun play a major role 
in  determining  whether  a  singular  count  noun 
may  appear  without  a  determiner  in  a  PNC. 
Stvan  (1998)  assumes  that  nouns  determine  the 
well-formedness of PNCs (3) if the denotation of 
the  noun  occurs  in  a  particular  semantic  field, 
while  Baldwin  et  al.  (2006)  assume  that  certain 
prepositions  impose  selection  restrictions  on 
their nominal complements that allow for deter-
miner omission (4).  
(3)  from school, at school, in jail, from jail, … 
(4)  by train, by plane, by bus, by pogo stick, by 

hydro-foil … 

Interestingly, Le Bruyn et al. (2009) have ob-
served that basic assumptions of Stvan’s analysis 
do  not  apply  to  Dutch,  French,  or  Norwegian. 
With regard to German, we observe that neither 
the  pattern  in  (3)  nor  in  (4)  is  productive.  Con-
structions like (4) cannot be realized as PNCs in 
German, but require full PPs. 

In  the  following,  we  propose  an  analysis  of 
PNCs  that  combines  corpus  annotation,  annota-
tion  mining  (Chiarcos  et  al.,  2008),  and  logistic 
regression modeling (Harrell, 2001). Annotation 
mining  assumes  that  linguistically  relevant  gen-
eralizations can be derived in a bottom-up fash-
ion  from  a  suitably  annotated  corpus.  Relevant 
hits in the corpus are mapped into a feature vec-
tor  that  serves  as  input  for  logistic  regression 
classification. In the present case, the input con-

562

sists of sentences containing either PNCs or PPs. 
Binary  logistic  regression  suggests  itself  as  a 
classification method since the problem of PNCs 
can be rephrased as the following question: Un-
der which conditions can an otherwise obligatory 
determiner be omitted? 

The  majority  of  required  annotations  can  be 
derived automatically, but there are no available 
systems  for 
the  automatic  determination  of 
preposition  senses  in  German,  so  preposition 
sense  annotation  has  to  be  carried  out  manually 
and requires a language-specific tagset for prepo-
sition senses. 

While our initial analysis is based on German 
data, the general methodology can be applied to 
other  languages,  provided  that  corpora  receive 
proper annotation.     
2  Corpus annotation 
2.1  General characteristics  
The  present  analysis  is  based  on  a  newspaper 
corpus  of  the  Swiss-German  newspaper  Neue 
Zürcher Zeitung from 1993 to 1999, comprising 
approx.  230  million  words.  The  annotation  is 
based  on  an  XML-stand-off  format.  MMAX2 
(Müller  and  Strube,  2006)  is  used  for  manual 
annotation.  Annotations  are  carried  out  both  for 
PNCs and for full-fledged PPs. For each prepo-
sition,  the  following  data  is  considered:  PNCs, 
where N is a count noun; corresponding PPs with 
the  same  count  noun;  and  PPs  containing  count 
nouns not appearing inside PNCs. 

The  following  annotations  are  provided  for 

each dataset in the corpus: 

Lexical 

level:  part-of-speech, 

inflectional 
morphology,  derivational  morphology  of  nouns, 
count/mass distinction of nouns, interpretation of 
nouns, interpretation of prepositions, noun com-
pounding. 

Syntactic  level:  mode  of  embedding  of  the 
phrase  (adjunct  or  complement),  syntactic  de-
pendents of the noun, modification of the noun. 

Global  level:  Is  the  phrase  contained  in  a 
headline,  title,  or  quotation?  Is  the  phrase  idio-
matic?  Headlines,  titles,  and  quotations  are  par-
ticularly  prone  to  text  truncation  and  PNCs  oc-
curring here might not be the result of syntactic 
operations.  Similarly,  idiomatic  PNCs  and  PPs 
might  follow  combination  rules  that  differ  from 
the  general  modes  of  combination.  Hence,  the 

annotations  may  serve  to  exclude  these  cases 
from general classification.  
2.2  Automatic annotation  
The following tools are employed for automatic 
annotation:  Regression  Forest  Tagger  (Schmid 
and  Laws,  2008)  for  POS  tagging  and  morpho-
logical  analysis  (the  tagger  contains  the  SMOR 
component 
for  morphological  analysis,  cf. 
Schmid, 2004), and Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1995) 
for chunk parsing.  

To determine noun meanings, we make use of 
two  resources.  The  first  resource  is  GermaNet 
(Kunze  and  Lemnitzer,  2002),  the  German  ver-
sion of WordNet. We employ 23 top-level cate-
gories,  and  each  noun  is  annotated  with  every 
top-level  category  it  belongs  to.1 Secondly,  we 
use the computer lexicon HaGenLex (Hartrumpf 
et  al.,  2003),  which  offers  specific  sortal  infor-
mation derived from a formal ontology for each 
noun.  Finally,  we  employ  a  classifier  for  the 
count/mass  distinction.  The  classifier  combines 
lexical statistics, expressed in terms of a decision 
tree  classifier,  with  contextual 
information, 
which  is  handled  by  Naïve  Bayes  classification 
(cf.  Stadtfeld  2010).  The  classification  is  based 
on  the  fine-grained  distinctions  first  introduced 
in Allan (1980), but we employ a reduced set of 
five  instead  of  eight  classes.  The  classifier  is 
type-based  as  it  makes  use  of  the  relation  be-
tween  singular  and  plural  realizations  of  noun 
lemmas,  but  takes  the  immediate  context  of  the 
lemma into account.   

Nouns are only assigned to a particular class if 
both  classifiers  come  to  the  same  result  w.r.t.  
this  class  assignment.  While  this  leads  to  some 
nouns  being  excluded  from  the  count/mass  dis-
tinction, the resulting classes show a high degree 
of precision.   
2.3  Manual annotation of preposition senses 
Prepositions  are  highly  polysemous.  What  is 
more, the relation between a preposition and its 
senses  has  to  be  determined  in  a  language-
                                                 
1 Nouns that are assigned to more than one top-level cate-
gory are presumably homonymous or polysemous. We do 
not disambiguate the nouns. The reason is that individual 
features will be evaluated for their effect in a logistic model, 
and an ambiguous noun will receive a value in each feature. 
Hence, we can be sure that a significant semantic feature 
will be included in the classification.  

563

specific  manner.  While  the  Preposition  Project 
forms a basis for preposition sense annotation in 
English  (cf.  Litkowski  and  Hargraves  2005, 
2007), little attention has been paid to specialized 
annotation  schemata  for  preposition  senses  in 
German,  which  form  the  first  prerequisite  for  a 
classification of preposition senses.   

Based on four usage-based grammars and dic-
tionaries  of  German  (Duden  2002,  Helbig  and 
Buscha  2001,  Durrell  and  Brée  1993,  Schröder 
1986), we have developed an annotation schema 
with  a  hierarchical  structure,  allowing  for  sub-
trees  of  preposition  senses  that  require  a  fine-
grained  classification  (such  as  TEMPORAL,  SPA-
TIAL, CAUSAL, and PRESENCE). For temporal and 
spatial  interpretations,  the  annotation  is  further 
facilitated by the use of decision trees.2  

Altogether, the annotation schema includes the 
following  list  of  top-level  categories:  MODAL, 
CAUSAL, PRESENCE, SPATIAL, TEMPORAL, STATE, 
COMITATIVE,  AGENT,  REDUCTION/EXTENSION, 
PARTICIPATION,  SUBORDINATION,  RECIPIENT, 
AFFILIATION, 
CORRELATION/INTERACTION, 
TRANSGRESSION,  ORDER,  THEME,  SUBSTITUTE, 
EXCHANGE,  COMPARISON,  RESTRICTIVE,  COPU-
LATIVE,  ADVERSATIVE,  DISTRIBUTIVE,  STATE-
MENT/OPINION,  CENTRE  OF  REFERENCE,  and  RE-
ALISATION.  

Based on an extension of the weighted kappa 
statistic we have reached an overall kappa value 
(κw)  of  0.657  and  values  between  0.551  and 
0.860  for  individual  features  (cf.  Müller  et  al. 
2010a). Two properties of the annotation schema 
prohibit the application of a standard kappa sta-
tistic: First, the schema allows subsorts, and sec-
ondly, a preposition may receive more than one 
annotation if its sense cannot be fully disambigu-
ated. The values reported in Müller et al. (2010) 
for  maximal  subtypes  such  as  SPATIAL  (κw  = 
0.709)  and  TEMPORAL  (κw  =  0.860)  can  be 
equated  to  aggregate  values  in  standard  kappa 
statistics.   

In  the  models  presented  below,  we  employ 
top-level  categories  only  and  have  aggregated 
more specific sense annotations.  

                                                 
2 The schema does not directly distinguish between local 
and directional senses, but makes use of cross-classification 
to deal with the distinction. Cf. Müller et al. (2010b).  
 

3  Preparing  logistic  regression  models 
for  ohne  (‘without’)  and  unter  (‘un-
der’, ‘below’) 

The  problem  of  PNCs,  i.e.  why  a  determiner  is 
omitted  in  a  construction  which  otherwise  re-
quires  the  realization  of  the  determiner,  can  be 
rephrased as a problem for binary logistic regres-
sion and classification.  

While binary logistic regression does not pro-
hibit  monocausal  explanations,  typical  models 
for  binary  logistic  regression  employ  more  than 
one factor, and the value of the coefficients mod-
els  the  relative  influence  of  the  individual  fac-
tors. Logistic regression thus does not only help 
to  identify  factors  for  determiner  omission,  but 
also  reveals  the  interplay  of  multiple  licensing 
conditions  –  thus  possibly  accounting  for  the 
relative difficulty to distinguish acceptable from 
inacceptable PNCs. 

We  are  aiming  at  a  description  of  PNCs  in 

German for the 22 prepositions listed in (5). 
(5)  an, auf, bei, dank, durch, für, gegen, gemäß, 

hinter, in, mit, mittels, nach, neben, ohne, seit, 
über, um, unter, vor, während, wegen 

These  prepositions  have  been  chosen  on  the 
basis  of  the  following  two  assumptions:  a)  they 
appear  in  PNCs  and  PPs,  and  b)  their  ‘typical’ 
object is an NP.   

We  present  logistic  regression  models  of  de-
terminer  realization  for  two  prepositions:  ohne 
(‘without’) and unter (‘under’, ‘below’). The first 
preposition,  ohne,  is  the  only  preposition  that 
appears  more  often  in  PNCs  than  in  PPs.  The 
second preposition, unter, belongs to the class of 
highly polysemous prepositions. In fact, it is the 
preposition  with  the  second  largest  number  of 
senses (10 senses), only surpassed by mit (‘with’) 
(11 senses), which however appears much more 
often than unter in the corpus and thus requires 
further  annotation.  The  following  table  summa-
rizes  the  distribution  of  PNCs  and  PPs  for  both 
prepositions, after tokens that had been annotated 
as  belonging  to  headlines,  quotations,  telegram 
style  sentences,  or  as  being  idiomatic  were  ex-
cluded  from  the  data.  With  regard  to  the  first 
group  (headlines  etc.),  the  elimination  mostly 
applies  to  PNCs,  but  among  the  PPs  we  found 
many  idiomatic  expressions  and  fixed  phrases, 
which have also been excluded from modeling.

The analysis has been carried out in R (R De-
velopment  Core  Team,  2010)  and  makes  exten-
sive  use  of  Harrell’s  DESIGN  package  (Harrell, 
2001). 

The  feature  vector  consists  of  the  dependent 
variable  –  the  factor  DET with  its  levels  no  and 
yes – and of relevant classificatory features rep-
resenting the interpretation of the preposition (in 
terms of the features presented in section 2), the 
internal syntactic structure of the nominal projec-
tion  (prenominal  modification  of  N,  syntactic 
arguments of N, internal structure of N as a com-
pound,  derivational  status  of  N),  the  external 
syntactic embedding of the PNC or PP, and the 
interpretation of the noun.  

Features  starting  with  DEP  signify  syntactic 
arguments of the noun (DEP-S a sentential com-
plement,  DEP-NP an  NP  complement,  etc.);  the 
feature  ADJA  signifies  the  presence  of  one  or 
more  modifying  adjectives;  the  feature  COM-
POUND indicates whether the noun in question is 
a  compound.  The  feature  GOVERNED  indicates 
whether a noun or a verb governs the phrase. The 
feature  NOMINALIZATION  provides  information 
about  the  derivational  structure  of  the  noun,  in 
particular it indicates whether a noun is derived 
from a verb by use of the suffix –ung. 

Features  starting  with  GN are  GermaNet  top-
level  categories,  features  starting  with  HL  are 
HaGenLex  ontological  sorts;  both  describe  the 
interpretation of the noun.  

The  statistical  modeling  started  with  the  as-
sumption that each feature is relevant, so that an 
initial feature set of 92 features was considered. 
Feature  elimination  took  place  through  fast 
backwards  elimination  (Lawless  and  Singhal, 
1978) and manual inspection. The results of fast 
backwards elimination were not followed blindly. 
Following  Harrell’s  (2001:56)  suggestion,  we 
have  kept  factors  despite  their  low  significance 
levels.  In  most  cases,  however,  manual  inspec-
tion  and  fast  backwards  elimination  suggested 
the same results. The resulting models were sub-
jected to bootstrap validation to identify possible 
overfitting (cf. section 5.1).   

The value DET = no is taken to be the default 
value in the following models. As a consequence, 
negative  values  for  coefficients  indicate  rising 
probability  for  an  omission  of  a  determiner, 
while positive coefficients shift odds in favor of 
a realization of the determiner.

The logistic regression models developed for the 
prepositions ohne and unter make use of 13 and 
22  features,  respectively.  In  each  case,  we  have 
started with a full model fit (Harrell, 2001:58f.), 
evaluated  the  full  model  and  eliminated  factors 
through  manual  inspection  and  fast  backwards 
elimination.  The  coefficients  for  the  models  for 
ohne and unter are reported in tables 2 and 3.

Table 3. Coefficients for a logistic model of de-
terminer omission with unter. 
 
General measures of the two models are reported 
in table 4. Somers’ Dxy describes the proportion 
of observations, for which the model provides an 
appropriate class probability. Dxy can be derived 
from  C,  the  corresponding  receiver  operating 
characteristic curve area, since Dxy = 2 × (C–0.5). 
Model  L.R.  (likelihood  ratio)  indicates  the  im-
provement  reached  by  including  the  predictors. 
Degrees  of  freedom  (d.f.)  have  been  omitted 
from table 4, as they correspond to the number of 
predictors, i.e. 12 in the case of ohne and 23 in 
the  case  of  unter.  The  high  figures  for  Somers’ 
Dxy are reassuring.

The first group comprises the interpretation of 
the preposition. The group discriminates between 
determiner omission and realization. The seman-
tic features CAUSAL, COMITATIVE, and PARTICI-
PATION  show  positive  coefficients,  suggesting 
that  prepositions  receiving  the  aforementioned 
interpretations  tend  to  favor  an  ‘ordinary’  NP 
including a determiner. The interpretation PRES-
ENCE, on the other hand, shows a negative coef-
ficient  and  thus  suggests  the  omission  of  a  de-
terminer. There are further senses of ohne, which 
do  not  have  a  significant  effect  on  determiner 
omission/realization.   

Turning  to  the  representation  of  syntactic  ar-
gument  structure  of  the  noun,  we  find  that  the 
coefficients  of  DEP-S,  DEP-NP,  and  DEP-PP re-
ceive  positive  values  throughout.  The  presence 
of syntactic complements thus shifts odds in fa-
vor  of  determiner  realization.  There  is  a  strong 
preference  against  determiner  omission  with 
DEP-S, and somewhat weaker values for Dep-NP 
and  Dep-PP,  respectively.  A  comparison  of  in-
terpretation and complement realization offers a 
general assessment of PNCs. As ohne and unter 
share  only  a  few  senses,  we  do  not  necessarily 
expect  that  the  discerning  senses  relevant  for  a 
realization of a PNC with ohne carry over to un-
ter; but we do expect that features pertaining to 
the  syntactic  structure  of  the  nominal  comple-
ment play a role not only for ohne, but for unter 
(or  for  prepositions  admitting  PNCs  in  general) 
as well. And this prediction is actually borne out 
in  the  model  for  unter.  The  model  thus  already 
offers  interesting  insights  not  only  w.r.t.  the  re-
alization conditions of PNCs and PPs headed by 
ohne, but for broader analyses of PNCs as well.  
We will return to the role and value of the fea-
tures ADJA and NOMINALIZATION in section 4.3. 
The last group comprises the semantic charac-
teristics  of  nouns  derived  from  GermaNet.  If  a 
noun  is  classified  as  belonging  to  the  relevant 
GermaNet  top-level  categories,  determiner  omi-
ssion is favored.  
4.2  The model for unter 
A first glance at the model for unter shows that it 
requires a larger set of predictors than the model 
for ohne. In part, this is due to the higher degree 
of polysemy of unter: with more senses, we ex-
pect  more  semantic  predictors  to  enter  the  dis-
crimination. In addition, a wider range of senses 

566

also allows for a wider range of selection restric-
tions, and hence for a larger number of different 
sortal  specifications  for  selected  nouns.    The 
higher complexity of the model, however, should 
not conceal a peculiarity of this model that casts 
serious  doubt  on  the  idea  that  PNCs  are  mono-
causally licensed by particular senses of a prepo-
sition: the model selects five senses from the ten 
top level interpretations of unter, but the coeffi-
cients  are  unsigned.  Thus,  the  model  indicates 
that  the  senses  SPATIAL,  CAUSAL,  SUBORDINA-
TION,  ORDER,  and  TRANSGRESSION  block  the 
omission  of  a  determiner.  What  we  do  not  find 
are  senses  that  favor  the  omission  of  a  deter-
miner.  

The  features  DEP-S,  DEP-NP,  and  DEP-PP 
again  favor  the  realization  of  a  determiner.  A 
comparison  of  the  coefficient  of  DEP-S  to  the 
coefficients of DEP-NP and DEP-PP shows, how-
ever,  that  the  presence  of  a  sentential  comple-
ment has a strong influence on determiner reali-
zation, while NP- and PP-complements may still 
occur in PNCs, as their coefficients are relatively 
low  (also  in  comparison  to  the  coefficients  of 
these values for ohne).4  

In  more  general  terms,  we  suspect  a  general 
mechanism  relating  sentential  complementation 
to the realization of the determiner, a topic to be 
addressed in future research.   

It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  external  syn-
tactic  realization  of  the  phrase  plays  a  role  for 
unter. The feature GOVERNED did not play a role 
for ohne, but suggests the realization of a deter-
miner  for  unter.  The  reason  might  be  that  few 
verbs  or  nouns  govern  the  preposition  ohne. 
Prepositional  objects  headed  by  unter, however, 
are  more  common.  Prepositional  objects  headed 
by ohne make up only 1.2 % of the occurrences 
of ohne in the present corpus, while the share of 
prepositional  objects  headed  by  unter  is  three 
times larger: 3.6 %.  

Finally, we note that a variety of sortal classi-
fications for nouns suggest either an omission or 
realization  of  the  determiner,  supporting  the  as-

                                                 
4 One could argue against the inclusion of the coefficient for 
DEP-PP altogether, as it does not seem to be significant (p > 
0.05) in the first place. However, we have followed Har-
rell’s (2001) advice that blind exclusion of seemingly insig-
nificant factors may not lead to model improvement. In fact, 
models for unter including Dep-PP outperform models ex-
cluding this feature. 

sumption  that  in  addition  to  the  preposition’s 
meaning,  the  meaning  of  the  noun  plays  a  role. 
GermaNet top-level categories were already dis-
criminating in the model for ohne; but the model 
for  unter  also  makes  use  of  HaGenLex  sortal 
categories  (HL-AD  and  HL-AS).  The  predictors 
stand  for  dynamic  and  static  concepts  that  both 
receive an abstract interpretation. Their inclusion 
is  particularly  interesting,  as  it  is  sometimes 
claimed  (e.g.  Bale  and  Barner,  2009)  that  ‘ab-
stract’ nouns are never to be classified as count 
nouns. 
4.3  General assessment of the models  
Both models show that the realization of syntac-
tic  complements,  of  sentential  complements  in 
particular, seems to impede determiner omission. 
That syntactic complexity does not seem to play 
a  role  per  se,  can  be  deduced  from  the  coeffi-
cients  for  the  factor  ADJA:  While  ADJA  favors 
determiner realization with ohne, it prohibits de-
terminer realization with unter.  

The  role  of  morphological  derivation  through 
–ung, as represented by the factor NOMINALIZA-
TION, is the same in both models: derived nomi-
nals  shift  odds  in  favor  of  determiner  omission. 
While the derivational structure might be consid-
ered  a  formal  property  of  the  construction,  it 
might also reflect an underlying denotational dis-
tinction between events and objects, which has to 
be clarified in future work.  

It  is  a  striking  feature  of  the  model  for unter 
that  we  do  not  find  interpretational  features  of 
the preposition unter that favor determiner omis-
sion. Taken together with the other factors in the 
two  models  presented,  the  analysis  suggests  a 
picture  rather  different  from  the  (more  or  less) 
monocausal  analyses  of  Stvan  (1998)  and 
Baldwin  et  al.  (2006).  With  regard  to  unter  a 
model in the sense of Baldwin et al. (2006) could 
only  provide  negative  rules  of  the  form  “if  P 
does not mean this, its nominal complement may 
be  realized  without  a  determiner”,  but  such  a 
model would lead to less precision than the mul-
ticausal model presented here. 
5  Validation of the models 
5.1  Bootstrap validation 
Logistic  regression  models  may  suffer  from 
overfitting  the  data.  We  have  thus  carried  out  a 

567

 

 

bootstrap validation of both models and applied 
penalized  maximum  likelihood  estimation  (Har-
rell, 2001) to the models. The results of the ini-
tial (non-penalized) models are reported in Table 
5  and  Table  6,  where  we  report  values  for  Dxy 
and  the  average  maximal  error  of  the  model. 
Bootstrap validation makes use of sampling with 
replacement. The training samples for evaluation 
thus  may  contain  certain  instances  many  times, 
but some original data will never be sampled and 
can  thus  be  used  for  testing  the  models.  Boot-
strap validation is carried out 200 times, the re-
sults being averaged. The overfitting of the mod-
els  is  determined  by  the  optimism  derived  from 
the bootstrap evaluation.

The respective influence of individual factors can 
be  read  of  a  nomogram  (Banks,  1985)  derived 
from the models presented above (we make use 
of  a  tabular  presentation  for  reasons  of  legibil-

bles 9 and 10. Table 9 lists the individual scores 
for the factors in the model for ohne, were 0 in-
dicates that the pertinent property is not present 
and 1 indicates that the property is present. Table 
10  maps  the  sum  to  probability  of  determiner 
omission.

points to probability of determiner omission. 

 

As an illustration, consider pairs of ohne and a 

noun with the values in (6) and (7). 
(6)  NOMINALIZATION = 1, ADJA = 1, COMITA-

TIVE = 1, all other senses including PRESENCE 
= 0, all GN features = 0, DEP features = 0. 

(7)  NOMINALIZATION = 0, ADJA = 1, PRESENCE = 
1, all other senses = 0, GN-ATTRIBUTE = 1, all 
other GN features = 0, DEP features = 0. 

Given  the  individual  scores  for  the  factors  in 
table 9, the total number of points for the combi-
nation  in  (6)  is  144,  leading  to  a  probability  of 
0.7 that a determiner will be omitted in the con-
struction. In other words, a determiner omission 
is likely with the feature set given in (6). In (7), 
we reach a total of 92 only, so that the likelihood 
of determiner omission rises above 0.9. 
6  Summary and prospects 
The  models  presented  support  the  general  as-
sumption  that  the  realization  or  omission  of  a 
determiner  in  a  prepositional  phrase  should  be 
analyzed  as  a  multicausal  phenomenon.  The  lo-
gistic  regression  analysis  presents  evidence  for 
the assumption that the senses of the preposition 
and the interpretation of the noun (possibly gov-
erned by selection restrictions of the preposition) 
as  well  as  the  syntactic  complexity  of  the  em-
bedded  nominal  projection  are  major  factors  in 
determining whether an article can be dropped or 
not.  

With regard to the complexity of the nominal 
projection,  the  two  models  presented  here  indi-
cate that it is not complexity per se, but that the 
realization of a complement of the noun, in par-
ticular of a sentential complement, clearly raises 
the probability of article realization. While this is 
a  speculation,  based  on  the  models  presented 
here, it might very well be that this dependency 
reflects a deeper referential requirement.  

In developing further models for prepositions, 
we expect that the realization of a complement of 
the noun will establish itself as a common factor, 

but this has to await further research and model 
development.
