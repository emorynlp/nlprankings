Abstract

This paper describes our WMT submis-
sions CU-BOJAR and CU-DEPFIX, the lat-
ter dubbed “CHIMERA” because it com-
bines on three diverse approaches: Tec-
toMT, a system with transfer at the deep
syntactic level of representation, factored
phrase-based translation using Moses, and
finally automatic rule-based correction of
frequent grammatical and meaning errors.
We do not use any off-the-shelf system-
combination method.

1 Introduction

Targeting Czech in statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) is notoriously difficult due to the
large number of possible word forms and com-
plex agreement rules. Previous attempts to resolve
these issues include specific probabilistic models
(Subotin, 2011) or leaving the morphological gen-
eration to a separate processing step (Fraser et al.,
2012; Mareček et al., 2011).

TectoMT (CU-TECTOMT, Galuščáková et al.
(2013)) is a hybrid (rule-based and statistical) MT
system that closely follows the analysis-transfer-
synthesis pipeline. As such, it suffers from many
issues but generating word forms in proper agree-
ments with their neighbourhood as well as the
translation of some diverging syntactic structures
are handled well. Overall, TectoMT sometimes
even ties with a highly tuned Moses configuration
in manual evaluations, see Bojar et al. (2011).

Finally, Rosa et al. (2012) describes Depfix, a
rule-based system for post-processing (S)MT out-
put that corrects some morphological, syntactic
and even semantic mistakes. Depfix was able to
significantly improve Google output in WMT12,
so now we applied it on an open-source system.

Our WMT13 system is thus a three-headed
creature where, hopefully: (1) TectoMT provides

missing word forms and safely handles some non-
parallel syntactic constructions, (2) Moses ex-
ploits very large parallel and monolingual data,
and boosts better lexical choice, (3) Depfix at-
tempts to fix severe flaws in Moses output.

Figure 1: CHIMERA: three systems combined.

CHIMERA is a sequential combination of three
diverse MT systems as depicted in Figure 1. Each
of the intermediate stages of processing has been
submitted as a separate primary system for the
WMT manual evalution, allowing for a more thor-
ough analysis.

Instead of an off-the-shelf system combination
technique, we use TectoMT output as synthetic
training data for Moses as described in Section 2.1
and finally we process its output using rule-based
corrections of Depfix (Section 2.2). All steps di-
rectly use the source sentence.

2.1 Moses Setup for CU-BOJAR

We ran a couple of probes with reduced training
data around the setup of Moses that proved suc-
cessful in previous years (Bojar et al., 2012a).

2.1.1 Pre-processing
We use a stable pre-processing pipeline that in-
cludes normalization of quotation marks,1 tok-
enization, tagging and lemmatization with tools

1We do not simply convert them to unpaired ASCII quotes
but rather balance them and use other heuristics to convert
most cases to the typographically correct form.

Table 1: Letter Casing

included in the Treex platform (Popel and
Žabokrtský, 2010).

This year, we evaluated the end-to-end effect of
truecasing. Ideally, English-Czech SMT should be
trained on data where only names are uppercased
(and neither the beginnings of sentences, nor all-
caps headlines or exclamations etc). For these ex-
periments, we trained a simple baseline system on
1 million sentence pairs from CzEng 1.0.

Table 1 summarizes the final (case-sensitive!)
BLEU scores for four setups. The standard ap-
proach is to train SMT lowercase and apply a re-
caser, e.g. the Moses one, on the output. Another
option (denoted “lc→form”) is to lowercase only
the source side of the parallel data. This more
or less makes the translation model responsible
for identifying names and the language model for
identifying beginnings of sentences.

The final two approaches attempt at “truecas-
ing” the data, i.e. the ideal lowercasing of ev-
erything except names. Our simple unsupervised
truecaser (“utc”) uses a model trained on monolin-
gual data (1 million sentences in this case, same
as the parallel training data used in this experi-
ment) to identify the most frequent “casing shape”
of each token type when it appears within a sen-
tence and then converts its occurrences at the be-
ginnings of sentences to this shape. Our super-
vised truecaser (“stc”) casts the case of the lemma
on the form, because our lemmatizers for English
and Czech produce case-sensitive lemmas to indi-
cate names. After the translation, only determinis-
tic uppercasing of sentence beginnings is needed.

We confirm that “stc” as we have been using it
for a couple of years is indeed the best option, de-
spite its unpleasingly frequent omissions of names
(incl. “Spojené státy”, “the United States”). One
of the rules in Depfix tries to cast the case from
the source to the MT output but due to alignment
errors, it is not perfect in fixing these mistakes.

Surprisingly, the standard recasing worked
worse than “lc→form”, suggesting that two Moses
runs in a row are worse than one joint search.

We consider using a full-fledged named entity
recognizer in the future.

Table 2: Basic Statistics of Parallel Data.

2.1.2 Factored Translation for Morphological
Coherence

We use a quite standard factored configuration of
Moses. We translate from “stc” to two factors:
“stc” and “tag” (full Czech positional morpholog-
ical tag). Even though tags on the target side make
the data somewhat sparser (a single Czech word
form typically represents several cases, numbers
or genders), we do not use any back-off or alterna-
tive decoding path. A high-order language model
on tags is used to promote grammatically correct
and coherent output. Our system is thus less prone
to errors in local morphological agreement.

2.1.3 Large Parallel Data
The main source of our parallel data was CzEng
1.0 (Bojar et al., 2012b). We also used Europarl
(Koehn, 2005) as made available by WMT13 orga-
nizers.2 The English-Czech part of the new Com-
mon Crawl corpus was quite small and very noisy,
so we did not include it in our training data. Ta-
ble 2 provides basic statistics of the data.

Processing large parallel data can be challeng-
ing in terms of time and computational resources
required. The main bottlenecks are word align-
ment and phrase extraction.

GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) has been the
standard tool for computing word alignment in
phrase-based MT. A multi-threaded version exists
(Gao and Vogel, 2008), which also supports incre-
mental extensions of parallel data by applying a
saved model on a new sentence pair. We evaluated
these tools and measured their wall-clock time3 as
well as the final BLEU score of a full MT system.

Surprisingly, single-threaded GIZA++ was con-
siderably faster than single-threaded MGIZA. Us-
ing 12 threads, MGIZA outperformed GIZA++
but the difference was smaller than we expected.

Table 3 summarizes the results. We checked the
difference in BLEU using the procedure by Clark
et al. (2011) and GIZA++ alignments were indeed

little but significantly better than MGIZA in three
MERT runs.

We thus use the standard GIZA++ aligner.

2.1.4 Large Language Models
We were able to collect a very large amount of
monolingual data for Czech: almost 216 million
sentences, 3.6 billion tokens. Table 4 lists the
corpora we used. CWC Articles is a section of
the Czech Web Corpus (Spoustová and Spousta,
2012). CNC News refers to a subset of the Czech
National Corpus4 from the news domain. CNA
is a corpus of Czech News Agency stories from
1998 to 2012. Newspapers is a collection of ar-
ticles from various Czech newspapers from years
1998 to 2002. Finally, News Crawl is the mono-
lingual corpus made available by the organizers of
WMT13.

We created an in-domain language model from
all the corpora except for CzEng (where we only
used the news section). We were able to train a 4-
gram language model using KenLM (Heafield et
al., 2013). Unfortunately, we did not manage to
use a model of higher order. The model file (even
in the binarized trie format with probability quan-
tization) was so large that we ran out of memory
in decoding.5 We also tried pruning these larger
models but we did not have enough RAM.

To cater for a longer-range coherence, we
trained a 7-gram language model only on the News
Crawl corpus (concatenation of all years). In this
case, we used SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) and pruned
n-grams so that (training set) model perplexity

guage models.

does not increase more than 10−14. The data for
this LM exactly match the domain of WMT test
sets.

Finally, we model sequences of morphological
tags on the target side using a 10-gram LM es-
timated from CzEng. Individual sections of the
corpus (news, fiction, subtitles, EU legislation,
web pages, technical documentation and Navajo
project) were interpolated to match WMT test sets
from 2007 to 2011 best. This allows even out-of-
domain data to contribute to modeling of overall
sentence structure. We filtered the model using the
same threshold 10−14.

Table 5 summarizes the resulting LM files as
used in CU-BOJAR and CHIMERA.

2.1.5 Bigger Tuning Sets
Koehn and Haddow (2012) report benefits from
tuning on a larger set of sentences. We experi-
mented with a down-scaled MT system to com-
pare a couple of options for our tuning set: the
default 3003 sentences of newstest2011, the de-
fault and three more Czech references that were
created by translating from German, the default
and two more references that were created by post-
editing a variant of our last year’s Moses system
and also a larger single-reference set consisting
of several newstest years. The preliminary re-
sults were highly inconclusive: negligibly higher
BLEU scores obtained lower manual scores. Un-
able to pick the best configuration, we picked the
largest. We tune our systems on “bigref”, as spec-
ified in Table 6. The dataset consists of 11583
source sentences, 3003 of which have 4 reference
translations and a subset (1997 sents.) of which
has 2 reference translations constructed by post-
editing. The dataset does not include 2010 data as
a heldout for other foreseen experiments.

2.1.6 Synthetic Parallel Data
Galuščáková et al. (2013) describe several possi-
bilities of combining TectoMT and phrase-based
approaches. Our CU-BOJAR uses one of the sim-
pler but effective ones: adding TectoMT output on
the test set to our training data. As a contrast to

Total 4 11583

Table 6: Our big tuning set (bigref).

CU-BOJAR, we also examine PLAIN Moses setup
which is identical but lacks the additional syn-
thetic phrase table by TectoMT.

In order to select the best balance between
phrases suggested by TectoMT and our parallel
data, we provide these data as two separate phrase
tables. Each phrase table brings in its own five-
tuple of scores, one of which, the phrase-penalty
functions as an indicator how many phrases come
from which of the phrase tables. The standard
MERT is then used to optimize the weights.6,7

We use one more trick compared to
Galuščáková et al. (2013): we deliberately
overlap our training and tuning datasets. When
preparing the synthetic parallel data, we use the
English side of newstests 08 and 10–13. The
Czech side is always produced by TectoMT. We
tune on bigref (see Table 6), so the years 08, 11
and 12 overlap. (We could have overlapped also
years 07, 09 and 10 but we had them originally
reserved for other purposes.) Table 7 summarizes
the situation and highlights that our setup is fair:
we never use the target side of our final evaluation
set newstest2013. Some test sets are denoted
“could have” as including them would still be
correct.

The overlap allows MERT to estimate how use-
ful are TectoMT phrases compared to the standard
phrase table not just in general but on the spe-
cific foreseen test set. This deliberate overfitting
to newstest 08, 11 and 12 then helps in translating
newstest13.

This combination technique in its current state
is rather expensive as a new phrase table is re-
quired for every new input document. However,
if we fix the weights for the TectoMT phrase ta-

6Using K-best batch MIRA (Cherry and Foster, 2012) did
not work any better in our setup.

7We are aware of the fact that Moses alternative decoding
paths (Birch and Osborne, 2007) with similar phrase tables
clutter n-best lists with identical items, making MERT less
stable (Eisele et al., 2008; Bojar and Tamchyna, 2011). The
issue was not severe in our case, CU-BOJAR needed 10 itera-
tions compared to 3 iterations needed for PLAIN.

ble, we can avoid re-tuning the system (whether
this would degrade translation quality needs to be
empirically evaluated). Moreover, if we use a dy-
namic phrase table, we could update it with Tec-
toMT outputs on the fly, thus bypassing the need
to retrain the translation model.

2.2 Depfix

Depfix is an automatic post-editing tool for cor-
recting errors in English-to-Czech SMT. It is ap-
plied as a post-processing step to CU-BOJAR, re-
sulting in the CHIMERA system. Depfix 2013 is an
improvement of Depfix 2012 (Rosa et al., 2012).

Depfix focuses on three major types of language
phenomena that can be captured by employing lin-
guistic knowledge but are often hard for SMT sys-
tems to get right:
• morphological agreement, such as:

– an adjective and the noun it modifies have to
share the same morphological gender, num-
ber and case

– the subject and the predicate have to agree in
morphological gender, number and person, if
applicable

• transfer of meaning in cases where the same
meaning is expressed by different grammatical
means in English and in Czech, such as:
– a subject in English is marked by being a left

modifier of the predicate, while in Czech a
subject is marked by the nominative morpho-
logical case

– English marks possessiveness by the preposi-
tion ’of’, while Czech uses the genitive mor-
phological case

– negation can be marked in various ways in
English and Czech

• verb-noun and noun-noun valency—see (Rosa
et al., 2013)
Depfix first performs a complex lingustic anal-

translation to Czech by CU-BOJAR. The anal-
ysis includes tagging, word-alignment, and de-
pendency parsing both to shallow-syntax (“analyt-
ical”) and deep-syntax (“tectogrammatical”) de-
pendency trees. Detection and correction of errors
is performed by rule-based components (the va-
lency corrections use a simple statistical valency
model). For example, if the adjective-noun agree-
ment is found to be violated, it is corrected by
projecting the morphological categories from the
noun to the adjective, which is realized by chang-
ing their values in the Czech morphological tag
and generating the appropriate word form from the
lemma-tag pair using the rule-based generator of
Hajič (2004).

Rosa (2013) provides details of the current ver-
sion of Depfix. The main additions since 2012 are
valency corrections and lost negation recovery.

3 Overall Results

Table 8 reports the scores on the WMT13 test
set. BLEU and TER are taken from the evalu-
ation web site8 for the normalized outputs, case
insensitive. The normalization affects typeset-
ting of punctuation only and greatly increases
automatic scores. “WMT ranking” lists results
from judgments from Appraise and Mechanical
Turk. Except CU-TECTOMT, the manual evalua-
tion used non-normalized MT outputs. The fig-
ure is the WMT12 standard interpretation as sug-
gested by Bojar et al. (2011) and says how often
the given system was ranked better than its com-
petitor across all 18.6k non-tying pairwise com-
parisons extracted from the annotations.

We see a giant leap from CU-TECTOMT to CU-
BOJAR, confirming the utility of large data. How-
ever, CU-TECTOMT had something to offer since it
improved over PLAIN, a very competitive baseline,
by 0.6 BLEU absolute. Depfix seems to slightly
worsen BLEU score but slightly improve TER; the

manual evaluation is similarly indecisive.

4 Combination Analysis

We now closely analyze the contributions of
the individual engines to the performance of
CHIMERA. We look at translations of the new-
stest2013 sets produced by the individual systems
(PLAIN, CU-TECTOMT, CU-BOJAR, CHIMERA).

We divide the newstest2013 reference tokens
into two classes: those successfully produced by
CHIMERA (Table 9) and those missed (Table 10).
The analysis can suffer from false positives as well
as false negatives, a “confirmed” token can violate
some grammatical constraints in MT output and
an “unconfirmed” token can be a very good trans-
lation. If we had access to more references, the
issue of false negatives would decrease.

Table 9 indicates that more than 3/4 of to-
kens confirmed by the reference were available
in all CHIMERA components: PLAIN Moses, CU-
TECTOMT alone but also in the subsequent combi-
nations CU-BOJAR and the final CU-DEPFIX.

PLAIN Moses produced 13% tokens that Tec-
toMT did not provide and TectoMT output
roughly 8% tokens unknown to Moses. However,
note that it is difficult to distinguish the effect of
different model weights: PLAIN might have pro-
duced some of those tokens as well if its weights
were different. The row “Other” includes cases
where e.g. Depfix introduced a confirmed token
that none of the previous systems had.

Table 10 analyses the potential of CHIMERA
components. These tokens from the reference
were not produced by CHIMERA. In almost 80%
of cases, the token was not available in any 1-best
output; it may have been available in Moses phrase

96



tables or the input sentence.
TectoMT offered almost 10% of missed tokens,

but these were not selected in the subsequent com-
bination. The potential of Moses is somewhat
lower (about 8%) because our phrase-based com-
bination is likely to select wordings that score well
in a phrase-based model. 385 tokens were sug-
gested by both TectoMT and Moses alone, but the
combination in CU-BOJAR did not select them, and
finally 370 tokens were produced by the combina-
tion while they were not present in 1-best output of
neither TectoMT nor Moses. Remember, all these
tokens eventually did not get to CHIMERA output,
so Depfix must have changed them.

4.1 Depfix analysis
Table 11 analyzes the performance of the individ-
ual components of Depfix. Each evaluated sen-
tence was either modified by a Depfix component,
or not. If it was modified, its quality could have
been evaluated as better (improved), worse (wors-
ened), or the same (equal) as before. Thus, we can
evaluate the performance of the individual compo-
nents by the following measures:9

precision = #improved#improved+#worsened (1)

impact = #modified#evaluated (2)

useless = #equal#modified (3)

Please note that we make an assumption that if
a sentence was modified by multiple Depfix com-
ponents, they all have the same effect on its qual-
ity. While this is clearly incorrect, it is impossible
to accurately determine the effect of each individ-
ual component with the evaluation data at hand.
This probably skews especially the reported per-
formance of “high-impact” components, which of-
ten operate in combination with other components.

The evaluation is computed on 871 hits in which
CU-BOJAR and CHIMERA were compared.

The results show that the two newest compo-
nents – Lost negation recovery and Valency model
– both modify a large number of sentences. Va-
lency model seems to have a slightly negative ef-
fect on the translation quality. As this is the only
statistical component of Depfix, we believe that
this is caused by the fact that its parameters were
not tuned on the final CU-BOJAR system, as the

convenience, even though the way we define it does not match
exactly its usual definition.

tuning has to be done semi-manually and the fi-
nal system was not available in advance. On the
other hand, Lost negation recovery seems to have
a highly positive effect on translation quality. This
is to be expected, as a lost negation often leads to
the translation bearing an opposite meaning to the
original one, which is probably one of the most
serious errors that an MT system can make.

5 Conclusion

We have reached our chimera to beat Google
Translate. We combined all we have: a deep-
syntactic transfer-based system TectoMT, very
large parallel and monolingual data, factored setup
to ensure morphological coherence, and finally
Depfix, a rule-based automatic post-editing sys-
tem that corrects grammaticality (agreement and
valency) of the output as well as some features vi-
tal for adequacy, namely lost negation.
