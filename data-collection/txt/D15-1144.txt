Abstract

As conventional word alignment search
algorithms usually ignore the consistency
constraint in translation rule extraction,
improving alignment accuracy does not
necessarily increase translation quality.
We propose to use coverage, which
reflects how well extracted phrases can
recover the training data, to enable word
alignment to model consistency and corre-
late better with machine translation. This
can be done by introducing an objective
that maximizes both alignment model
score and coverage. We introduce an
efficient algorithm to calculate coverage
on the fly during search. Experiments
show that our consistency-aware search
algorithm significantly outperforms both
generative and discriminative alignment
approaches across various languages and
translation models.

1 Introduction

Word alignment, which aims to identify the
correspondence between words in two languages,
plays an important role in statistical machine
translation (Brown et al., 1993). Word alignment
and translation rule extraction often constitute two
consecutive steps in the training pipeline. Word-
aligned bilingual corpora serve as a fundamental
resource for translation rule extraction, not only
for phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003; Och
and Ney, 2004), but also for syntax-based models
(Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006). Dividing
alignment and extraction into two separate steps
significantly improves the efficiency and scala-
bility of parameter estimation as compared with
directly learning translation models from bilingual

corpora (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero and
Klein, 2008; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009).

However, separating word alignment from
translation rule extraction suffers from a major
problem: maximizing the accuracy of word align-
ment does not necessarily lead to the improvement
of translation quality. A number of studies
show that alignment error rate (AER) only has
a loose correlation with BLEU (Callison-Burch
et al., 2004; Goutte et al., 2004; Ittycheriah
and Roukos, 2005). Ayan and Dorr (2006)
find that precision-oriented alignments result in
better translation performance than recall-oriented
alignments. Fraser and Marcu (2007) show that
using AER and balanced F-measure can only
partially explain the effect of alignment quality on
BLEU for several language pairs.

We believe that the correlation problem arises
from the discrepancy between word alignment
and translation rule extraction. On one hand,
aligners seek to find the alignment with the
highest alignment model score, without regard
to structural constraints. Consequently, sensible
translation rules may not be extracted because
they violate consistency constraints required by
translation rule extraction (Och and Ney, 2004).
Wang et al. (2010) find that the standard alignment
tools are not optimal for training syntax-based
models. As a result, they have to resort to re-
aligning. On the other hand, the consistency
constraint used in most translation rule extraction
algorithms tolerate wrong links within consistent
phrase pairs. Chiang (2007) uses the union
of two unidirectional alignments, which usually
has a low precision, for extracting hierarchical
phrases. Therefore, it is important to include
both alignment model score and the consistency
constraint in the optimization objective of word
alignment.

In this work, we propose to use coverage,
which measures how well extracted phrases can

the training example, and (b) an alignment resulting in a set of bilingual phrases that fails to fully recover

links that both have low posterior probabilities and hurt the recovery (e.g., the link between “huiwu” and
“hold”).

recover the training data, to bridge word alignment
and (hierarchical) phrase-based translation. We
introduce a new alignment search algorithm with
an objective that maximizes both alignment model
score and coverage while keeping the training
algorithm unchanged. The coverage of an align-
ment is calculated on the fly during search using
a local phrase extraction algorithm. Experiments
show that our approach achieves significant im-
provements over state-of-the-art baselines across
various languages and translation models.

2 Background

We begin by introducing the preliminaries of word
alignment and phrase-based translation.

Definition 1 Given a source-language sentence
f = fJ1 = f1 . . . fJ and a target-language sentence
e = eI1 = e1 . . . eI , an alignment a is a subset
of the Cartesian product of the word positions of
two sentences: a ⊆ {(j, i) : j = 1, . . . , J ; i =
1, . . . , I}.

Figure 1(a) shows an alignment for a Chinese
sentence “oumeng he eluosi shounao huiwu zai
mosike juxing” and an English sentence “EU and
Russia hold summit in Moscow”. We use black
circles to denote links. The link (1, 1) indicates
that the first Chinese word “oumeng” and the first
English word “EU” are translations of each other.

Definition 2 Given a training example 〈f , e,a〉, a
bilingual phrase B is a pair of source and target
phrases: B = (f j2j1 , e

i2
i1

) such that 1 ≤ j1 ≤ j2 ≤
J ∧ 1 ≤ i1 ≤ i2 ≤ I .

For example, (“zai mosike”, “in Moscow”) in
Figure 1 can be denoted as a bilingual phrase
B = (f76 , e

7
6). For convenience, We use B.j1 and

B.j2 to denote the beginning and ending positions
of the source phrase in B, respectively. B.i1 and
B.i2 are defined likewise for the target side.

Definition 3 A bilingual phrase B = (f j2j1 , e
i2
i1

) is
said to be tight if and only if all boundary words
(i.e., fj1 , fj2 , ei1 , and ei2) are aligned. Otherwise,
it is a loose bilingual phrase.

For example, in Figure 1, while (f31 , e
3
1) is a

tight bilingual phrase, (f41 , e
4
1) is a loose bilingual

phrase.

Definition 4 (Och and Ney, 2004) Given a train-
ing example 〈f , e,a〉, a bilingual phrase B =
(f j2j1 , e

i2
i1

) is said to be consistent with the word
alignment a if and only if:

1. No words in the source phrase are aligned
with words outside the target phrase and vice
versa: ∀(j, i) ∈ a : j1 ≤ j ≤ j2 ↔ i1 ≤ i ≤
i2,

2. At least one word in the source phrase is
aligned with at least one word in the target

1229



phrase: ∃(j, i) ∈ a : j1 ≤ j ≤ j2 ∧ i1 ≤ i ≤
i2.

Alignment consistency forms the basis of trans-
lation rule extraction in modern SMT systems
(Koehn and Hoang, 2007; Chiang, 2007; Galley
et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006). In Figure 1,
(f31 , e

3
1) is consistent with the alignment because

all words in “oumeng he eluosi” are aligned with
all words in “EU and Russia”. In contrast, in
Figure 1(b), “huiwu shounao” and “hold summit”
are not consistent with the alignment because
“hold” is also aligned to a word “juxing” outside.

However, alignment consistency only defines a
loose relationship between alignment and trans-
lation. A phrase pair consistent with alignment
tolerates wrong inside links. For example, even
if “oumeng” is aligned with “Russia”, (f31 , e

3
1) is

still consistent. This is one possible reason that
maximizing alignment accuracy does not neces-
sarily lead to improved translation performance.

3 Modeling Consistency in Word
Alignment

Our intuition is that including the consistency
constraint in word alignment can hopefully reduce
the discrepancy between alignment and transla-
tion. While this idea has been suggested by a
number of authors (e.g., (Deng and Zhou, 2009;
DeNero and Klein, 2010)), our goal is to optimize
arbitrary alignment models with respect to end-to-
end translation in the search phase without labeled
data (see Related Work for detailed comparison).

A natural way is to include consistency in
the optimization objective as a regularization
term. However, as consistency is only defined
at the phrase level (see Definition 4), we need
a sentence-level measure to reflect how well an
alignment conforms to the consistency constraint.
A straightforward measure is the number of bilin-
gual phrases consistent with the alignment (phrase
count for short), which is easy and efficient to
calculate during search (Deng and Zhou, 2009).
Unfortunately, optimizing with respect to phrase
count is prone to yield alignments with very few
links in a biased way, which result in a large
number of bilingual phrases extracted from a small
fraction of the training data. Another alternative is
reachability (Liang et al., 2006a; Yu et al., 2013)
that indicates whether there exists a full derivation
to recover the training data. However, calculating
reachability faces a major problem: a large portion

of training data cannot be fully recovered due to
noisy alignments and the distortion limit (Yu et al.,
2013).

In this work, we propose coverage, which
reflects how well extracted phrases can recover
the training data, to measure the sentence-level
consistency. In the following, we will introduce
a number of definitions to facilitate the exposition.

Definition 5 A source word fj is said to be
covered by a bilingual phrase B = (f j2j1 , e

i2
i1

) if
and only if j1 ≤ j ≤ j2 : cov(fj , B) = Jj1 ≤ j ≤
j2K. Similarly, a target word ei is covered by B if
and only if i1 ≤ i ≤ i2.

The indicator function JexprK returns 1 if the
boolean expression expr is true and returns 0
otherwise. For example, in Figure 1(a), “oumeng”
and “EU” are covered by the bilingual phraseB =
(f31 , e

3
1).

Definition 6 Given a set of bilingual phrases B =
{B(k)}Kk=1, a source word fj is said to be covered
by the bilingual phrase set B if and only if it is
covered by at least one phrase inB : cov(fj ,B) =J∑Kk=1 cov(fj , B(k)) > 0K. The definition for a
target word is similar.

For example, in Figure 1(a), all source and
target words are covered by the bilingual phrase
set. In Figure 1(b), the source words “shounao”,
“huiwu”, “juxing” and the target words “hold” and
“summit” are not covered.

Definition 7 Given a sentence pair 〈f , e〉 and a
phrase length limit w 1, the hard coverage of an
alignment a is defined as a boolean value:

Ch(f , e,a, w) =

t
δ
( J∑

j=1

cov(fj ,B), J
)
∧

δ
( I∑

i=1

cov(ei,B), I
)|

(1)

where B = EXTRACT(f , e,a, 1, J, 1, I, w) is
the set of consistent bilingual phrases extracted
from the sentence pair using a standard phrase
extraction algorithm (Och and Ney, 2004). The
function δ returns true if the two parameters are
same and returns false otherwise.

1The phrase length limit w is essential in defining
coverage, restricting that the sentence pair must be covered
by bilingual phrases no longer than w words. Otherwise, a
very long bilingual phrase (e.g., the entire sentence pair) can
achieve full coverage in a biased way.

Depending on the tightness of extracted phrases
(see Definition 3), we further distinguish between
Ch+t(f , e,a, w) and Ch+l(f , e,a, w), which
denote hard coverage calculated with tight and
loose phrases, respectively.

Hard coverage denotes whether extracted
phrases can fully recover the training data. For
example, the values of hard coverage for Figures
1(a) and 1(b) are 1 and 0, respectively. As most
training examples can hardly be fully recovered,
we introduce soft coverage to better account for
partially recoverable training data.

Definition 8 Given a sentence pair 〈f , e〉 and a
phrase length limit w, the soft coverage of an
alignment a is defined as

Cs(f , e,a, w)

=
∑J

j=1 cov(fj ,B) +

Similarly, we also distinguish between Cs+t and
Cs+l depending on the tightness of extracted
phrases.

pus D = {〈f (s), e(s),a(s)〉}Ss=1 and a phrase
length limit w, the corpus-level soft coverage is

The corpus-level hard coverage is defined like-
wise.

4 Consistency-Aware Search

While Deng and Zhou (2009) focus on intro-
ducing an effectiveness function such as phrase
count into alignment symmetrization, we are inter-
ested in guiding the search algorithms of arbitrary
alignment models using coverage. Therefore, the
objective of our search algorithm is defined as

score(f , e,a, w,θ)
= M(f , e,a,θ) + λC(f , e,a, w) (4)

where M(f , e,a,θ) is alignment model score,
θ is a set of model parameters, C(f , e,a, w) is
coverage (either hard or soft), and λ is a hyper-
parameter that controls the preference between
alignment model score and coverage. 2

Therefore, the decision rule is given by

â = argmax
a∈A(f ,e)

{
score(f , e,a, w,θ)

}
(5)

where A(f , e) is a set of all possible alignments
for the sentence pair.

Algorithm 1 shows the consistency-aware
search algorithm for word alignment. The input
of the algorithm includes a source sentence f , a
target sentence e, a set of model parameters θ,
phrase length limit w, pruning parameters β and
b, and the number of most likely alignments to be
retaind n (line 1). Inspired by Liu et al. (2010),

2Note that training algorithms are unchanged. We
only introduce a new search algorithm that takes coverage
into consideration. We leave consistency-aware training
algorithms for arbitrary alignment models for future work.

1231



the algorithm starts with an empty alignment a
together with an empty phrase set B. We use
open to store active alignments during search and
N to store top-n alignments after search (lines
2-4). The procedure ADD(open, 〈a,B〉, β, b)
adds 〈a,B〉 to open and discards any alignment
that has a score worse than β multiplied by the
best score in the list or the score of the b-th best
alignment (line 5). For each iteration (line 6), we
use a list closed to store promising alignments
that have higher scores than the current alignment
(line 8). For every possible link l (line 9), the
algorithm produces a new alignment a′ and
updates the phrase set by calling a procedure
UPDATE(f , e,a, l,B, w) (lines 10-11). Then, the
algorithm calls a procedure GAIN(f , e,a,a′, w,θ)
to calculate the difference of model score after
adding the link l:

score(f , e,a′, w,θ)− score(f , e,a, w,θ)

If a′ has a higher score, it is added to closed
(line 13). We also update N to retain the top
n alignment explored during the search (line 15).
This process iterates until the model score does not
increase.

Algorithm 2 describes how to update the set
of extracted bilingual phrases after adding a link.
Our idea is to only update the phrases near the
added link l and keep other phrases unchanged.
This strategy improves the efficiency by avoiding
extracting phrases from the entire sentence pair.
The algorithm first removes bilingual phrases that
are either in the same row or in the same column
with l (lines 2-7). For example, in Figure 1,
the following bilingual phrases are removed after
adding the link between “huiwu” and “hold”
because the link breaks the consistency:

(“shounao huiwu”, “summit”)
(“juxing”, “hold”)

Other phrases out of the reach of the added link
remain unchanged.

Then, the algorithm extracts bilingual phrases
near l by calling the procedure EXTRACT. Note
that the phrase extraction is restricted to a local
region (j1, j2, i1, i2) by the phrase length limit w.
We use l.i and l.j to denote the source and target
positions of the link, respectively.

BLEU scores were calculated on the development

of the training data to train the phrase-based
model.

5 Experiments

5.1 Setup
5.1.1 Languages and Datasets
We evaluated our approach in terms of alignment
and translation quality on five language pairs:
Chinese-English (ZH-EN), Czech-English (CS-
EN), German-English (DE-EN), Spanish-English
(ES-EN), and French-English (FR-EN). The eval-
uation metrics for alignment and translation are
alignment error rate (AER) (Och and Ney, 2003)
and case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),
respectively.

For Chinese-English, the training data consists
of 1.2M pairs of sentences with 30.9M Chinese
words and 35.5M English words. We used
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 4-
gram language model on the Xinhua portion of
the English GIGAWORD corpus, which contains
398.6M words. For alignment evaluation, we used
the Tsinghua Chinese-English word alignment
evaluation data set (Liu and Sun, 2015). 3 For
translation evaluation, we used the NIST 2006
dataset as the development set and the NIST 2002,
2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008 datasets as the test
sets.

For other languages, the training data is Euro-
parl v7. The English language model trained
on the Xinhua portion of the English GIGA-
WORD corpus was also used for translation from
European languages to English. For translation
evaluation, we used the “news-test2012” dataset
that contains 3,003 sentences as the development
set and the “news-test2013” dataset that contains
3,000 sentences as the test set.

and discriminative alignment models. “generative” denotes applying the grow-diag-final heuristic to
the alignments produced by IBM Model 4 in two directions. “discriminative” denotes the log-linear
alignment model (Liu et al., 2010). Adding coverage leads to significant improvements. We use “**” to
denote that the difference is statistically significant at p < 0.01 level.

5.1.2 Alignment Models
We apply our approach to both generative and
discriminative alignment models. For generative
models, we used GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to
train IBM Model 4 in two directions. To calculate
a model score for symmetrized alignments, we fol-
low Liang et al. (2006b) to leverage link posterior
marginal probabilities. For discriminative models,
we used the open-source toolkit TsinghuaAligner
(Liu and Sun, 2015) that implements the log-linear
alignment model as described in (Liu et al., 2010).
The model score for the log-linear model is also
defined using link posteriors.

5.1.3 Translation Models
Two kinds of translation models, phrase-based
(Koehn et al., 2003) and hierarchical phrase-based
(Chiang, 2007), are used to evaluate whether
our approach improves the correlation between
alignment and translation. For the phrase-based
model, we used the open-source toolkit Moses
(Koehn and Hoang, 2007). For the hierarchical
phrase-based model, we used an in-house re-
implementation on par with state-of-the-art open-

source decoders.

5.2 Comparison of Different Settings
We first investigate the optimal setting for
coverage (hard vs. soft, tight vs. loose) on the
Chinese-English dataset. For quick validation,
we used a subset of the training data to train the
phrase-based model using Moses. We used the
development set to optimize the scaling factor λ
(see Eq. (4)) and set it to 0.3 in our experiments.

Table 1 compares Ch+l, Ch+t, Cs+l, and Cs+t.
We find that the “soft + tight” combination (i.e.,
Cs+t) yields the highest BLEU score on the
development set. One possible reason is that
tight phrases are usually of high quality and
soft coverage allows for taking full advantage of
the training data. On the contrary, Ch+t yields
the lowest BLEU score because hard coverage
fails to distinguish between partially recoverable
training examples as it assigns zero to all partially
recoverable data.

Then, we investigate the effect of the phrase
length limit w in Algorithm 1 on translation
quality. We find w = 7 achieves the best result,

1233



which is consistent with the default setting in
Moses. As a result, we used Cs+t and set w = 7
in the following experiments.

5.3 Comparison of Different Alignment
Methods

We compare our approach with a number of
alignment methods in terms of AER and BLEU,
including IBM Model 4 in two directions (C →
E and E → C), symmetrization heuristics (Inter-
section, Union, grow-diag-final), and consistency-
aware models (tight phrase count and coverage).
We used Moses to extract loose bilingual phrases
from word-aligned bilingual corpora from all
methods. Note that our approach uses Cs+t for
finding alignments, from which Moses extracts
loose phrases.

Table 2 lists the numbers of extracted bilingual
phrases (“# bp”), source phrases (“# sp”), target
phrases (“# tp”), source vocabulary size (“# sw”),
and target vocabulary size (“# tw”). We find
that a very large number of loose phrases can be
extracted from the Intersection alignments, which
also have the highest vocabulary sizes. However, a
large portion of words in these phrases are actually
unaligned, resulting in low translation quality.

We observe that adding consistency, either in
terms of phrase count or coverage, significantly
improves alignment accuracy by a large margin,
suggesting that imposing structural constraint
helps to reduce alignment errors. Our approach
outperforms all methods in terms of BLEU
significantly. Note that the coverage itself does
not correlate well with BLEU. It is important
to achieve a balance between model score and
coverage. As mentioned in Section 5.2, we set
λ = 0.3 in our experiments.

5.4 Translation Evaluation on Different
Alignment Models

We apply our approach to both generative (Brown
et al., 1993) and discriminative (Liu et al., 2010)
alignment models. As shown in Table 3, we find
that adding coverage to the optimization objective
significantly improves the BLEU scores. All
differences are statistically significant at p < 0.01
level. This finding suggests that our approach
generalizes well to various alignment models.

5.5 Translation Evaluation on Different
Translation Models

We also evaluated our approach on both phrase-
based and hierarchical phrase-based models. As
shown in Table 4, adding coverage to generative
models leads to significant improvements for
both models. All the differences are statistically
significant at p < 0.01 level.

Although coverage is designed for extracting
phrases, using coverage is still beneficial to hier-
archical phrase-based models because hierarchical
phrases are derived from phrases consistent with
word alignment. 4

5.6 Translation Evaluation on Different
Language Pairs

Finally, we report BLEU scores across five
language pairs in Table 5: Chinese-English (ZH-
EN), Czech-English (CS-EN), German-English
(DE-EN), Spanish-English (ES-EN), and French-
English (FR-EN). ZH-EN uses four references and
other language pairs only use single references.

We find that our approach outperforms the
baseline statistically significantly at p < 0.01 for
four language pairs and p < 0.05 for one language
pair. Therefore, using coverage to bridge word
alignment and machine translation can hopefully
benefit more languages.

6 Related Work

Our work is inspired by three lines of research:
(1) reachability in discriminative training of
translation models, (2) structural constraints for
alignment, and (3) learning with constraints.

6.1 Reachability in Discriminative Training
of Translation Models

Discriminative training algorithms for statistical
machine translation often need reachable training
examples to find full derivations for updating
model parameters (Liang et al., 2006a; Yu et
al., 2013). Yu et al. (2013) report that only
32.1% sentences in the Chinese-English training
data that contain 12.7% words are fully reachable

4We also tested our approach on syntax-based models
(Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006) but failed to achieve
significant improvements. The reason is that extracting
syntactic translation rules often imposes an additional con-
straint: a phrase must be a constituent that is subsumed by
a subtree. We believe that appending such constraint to the
optimization objective will hopefully benefit syntax-based
translation models. We leave this for future work.

due to noisy alignments and distortion limit. They
find that most reachable sentences are short and
generally literal.

We borrow the idea of measuring the degree
of recovering training data from reachability but
ignore the dependency between bilingual phrases
for efficiency. To calculate reachability, one
needs to figure out a full derivation, in which the
bilingual phrases cover the training data and do not
intersect with each other. Yu et al. (2013) indicate
that using forced decoding to select reachable
sentences with an unlimited distortion limit runs
inO(2nn3) time. In contrast, calculating coverage
is much easier and more efficient by ignoring the
dependency between phrases but still retains the
spirit of measuring recovery.

6.2 Structural Constraints for Alignment

Modeling structural constraints in alignment has
received intensive attention in the community,
either directly modeling phrase-to-phrase align-
ment (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero and
Klein, 2008; Cohn and Blunsom, 2009) or inter-
secting synchronous grammars with alignment
(Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Haghighi et
al., 2009).

Our work is in spirit most close to (Deng and
Zhou, 2009) and (DeNero and Klein, 2010). Deng
and Bowen (2009) cast combining IBM Model 4
alignments in two directions as an optimization
problem driven by an effectiveness function. They

evaluate the impact of adding or removing a
link with respect to phrase extraction using the
effectiveness function of phrase count. The major
difference is that we generalize their idea to
arbitrary alignment models in the search phase
rather than bidirectional alignment combination in
the post-processing phase. In addition, we find
that using coverage instead of phrase count results
in better translation performance (see Table 2).

DeNero and Klein (2010) develop a discrimi-
native model of extraction sets and optimize an
extraction-based loss function with respect to
translation. Their model is capable of predicting
the extracted phrase set. While their approach
relies on annotated data for training the discrimi-
native model, our method only needs to tune
the scaling factor λ on the development set. In
addition, our approach is very general and can
easily apply to arbitrary alignment models by
appending a term to the optimization objective.

6.3 Learning with Constraints

Our work is also related to learning with con-
straints such as constraint-driven learning (Chang
et al., 2007) and posterior regularization (Ganchev
et al., 2010). The basic idea is to inject
prior knowledge to the model as a regularization
term. The major difference is that our coverage
regularizer is independent of model parameters.
As a result, alignment models can still be trained
independently.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we have presented a general frame-
work for optimizing word alignment with respect
to machine translation. We introduce coverage
to measure how well extracted bilingual phrases
can recover the training data. We develop a
consistency-aware search algorithm that calculates
coverage on the fly during search efficiently.
Experiments show the our approach is effective
in both alignment and translation tasks across
various alignment models, translation models, and
language pairs.

In the future, we plan to apply our approach to
syntax-based models (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et
al., 2006; Shen et al., 2008) and include the con-
stituency constraint in the optimization objective.
It is also interesting to develop consistency-aware
training algorithms for word alignment.
