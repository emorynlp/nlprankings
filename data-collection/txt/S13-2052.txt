Abstract

In recent years, sentiment analysis in social
media has attracted a lot of research interest
and has been used for a number of applica-
tions. Unfortunately, research has been hin-
dered by the lack of suitable datasets, com-
plicating the comparison between approaches.
To address this issue, we have proposed
SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter, which included two subtasks: A, an
expression-level subtask, and B, a message-
level subtask. We used crowdsourcing on
Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large
Twitter training dataset along with additional
test sets of Twitter and SMS messages for both
subtasks. All datasets used in the evaluation
are released to the research community. The
task attracted significant interest and a total
of 149 submissions from 44 teams. The best-
performing team achieved an F1 of 88.9% and
69% for subtasks A and B, respectively.

1 Introduction

In the past decade, new forms of communication,
such as microblogging and text messaging have
emerged and become ubiquitous. Twitter messages
(tweets) and cell phone messages (SMS) are often
used to share opinions and sentiments about the sur-
rounding world, and the availability of social con-
tent generated on sites such as Twitter creates new
opportunities to automatically study public opinion.

Working with these informal text genres presents
new challenges for natural language processing be-
yond those encountered when working with more
traditional text genres such as newswire.

Tweets and SMS messages are short in length: a
sentence or a headline rather than a document. The
language they use is very informal, with creative
spelling and punctuation, misspellings, slang, new
words, URLs, and genre-specific terminology and
abbreviations, e.g., RT for re-tweet and #hashtags.1

How to handle such challenges so as to automati-
cally mine and understand the opinions and senti-
ments that people are communicating has only very
recently been the subject of research (Jansen et al.,
2009; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bifet et al., 2011;
Davidov et al., 2010; O’Connor et al., 2010; Pak and
Paroubek, 2010; Tumasjan et al., 2010; Kouloumpis
et al., 2011).

Another aspect of social media data, such as Twit-
ter messages, is that they include rich structured in-
formation about the individuals involved in the com-
munication. For example, Twitter maintains infor-
mation about who follows whom. Re-tweets (re-
shares of a tweet) and tags inside of tweets provide
discourse information. Modeling such structured in-
formation is important because it provides means for
empirically studying social interactions where opin-
ion is conveyed, e.g., we can study the properties of
persuasive language or those associated with influ-
ential users.

Several corpora with detailed opinion and senti-
ment annotation have been made freely available,
e.g., the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005) of
newswire text. These corpora have proved very
valuable as resources for learning about the lan-
guage of sentiment in general, but they did not focus
on social media.

1Hashtags are a type of tagging for Twitter messages.

Table 1: Examples of sentences from each corpus that contain subjective phrases.

While some Twitter sentiment datasets have al-
ready been created, they were either small and pro-
prietary, such as the i-sieve corpus (Kouloumpis
et al., 2011), or they were created only for Span-
ish like the TASS corpus2 (Villena-Román et al.,
2013), or they relied on noisy labels obtained from
emoticons and hashtags. They further focused on
message-level sentiment, and no Twitter or SMS
corpus with expression-level sentiment annotations
has been made available so far.

Thus, the primary goal of our SemEval-2013 task
2 has been to promote research that will lead to a
better understanding of how sentiment is conveyed
in Tweets and SMS messages. Toward that goal,
we created the SemEval Tweet corpus, which con-
tains Tweets (for both training and testing) and SMS
messages (for testing only) with sentiment expres-
sions annotated with contextual phrase-level polar-
ity as well as an overall message-level polarity. We
used this corpus as a testbed for the system evalua-
tion at SemEval-2013 Task 2.

In the remainder of this paper, we first describe
the task, the dataset creation process, and the evalu-
ation methodology. We then summarize the charac-
teristics of the approaches taken by the participating
systems and we discuss their scores.

2 Task Description

We had two subtasks: an expression-level subtask
and a message-level subtask. Participants could
choose to participate in either or both subtasks. Be-
low we provide short descriptions of the objectives
of these two subtasks.

Subtask A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation
Given a message containing a marked instance
of a word or a phrase, determine whether that
instance is positive, negative or neutral in that
context. The boundaries for the marked in-
stance were provided: this was a classification
task, not an entity recognition task.

2http://www.daedalus.es/TASS/corpus.php

Subtask B: Message Polarity Classification
Given a message, decide whether it is of
positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For
messages conveying both a positive and a
negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger
one was to be chosen.

Each participating team was allowed to submit re-
sults for two different systems per subtask: one con-
strained, and one unconstrained. A constrained sys-
tem could only use the provided data for training,
but it could also use other resources such as lexi-
cons obtained elsewhere. An unconstrained system
could use any additional data as part of the training
process; this could be done in a supervised, semi-
supervised, or unsupervised fashion.

Note that constrained/unconstrained refers to the
data used to train a classifier. For example, if other
data (excluding the test data) was used to develop
a sentiment lexicon, and the lexicon was used to
generate features, the system would still be con-
strained. However, if other data (excluding the test
data) was used to develop a sentiment lexicon, and
this lexicon was used to automatically label addi-
tional Tweet/SMS messages and then used with the
original data to train the classifier, then such a sys-
tem would be unconstrained.

3 Dataset Creation

In the following sections we describe the collection
and annotation of the Twitter and SMS datasets.

3.1 Data Collection
Twitter is the most common micro-blogging site on
the Web, and we used it to gather tweets that express
sentiment about popular topics. We first extracted
named entities using a Twitter-tuned NER system
(Ritter et al., 2011) from millions of tweets, which
we collected over a one-year period spanning from
January 2012 to January 2013; we used the public
streaming Twitter API to download tweets.

Instructions: Subjective words are ones which convey an opinion. Given a sentence, identify whether it is objective,
positive, negative, or neutral. Then, identify each subjective word or phrase in the context of the sentence and mark
the position of its start and end in the text boxes below. The number above each word indicates its position. The
word/phrase will be generated in the adjacent textbox so that you can confirm that you chose the correct range.
Choose the polarity of the word or phrase by selecting one of the radio buttons: positive, negative, or neutral. If a
sentence is not subjective please select the checkbox indicating that ”There are no subjective words/phrases”. Please
read the examples and invalid responses before beginning if this is your first time answering this hit.

SMS - Test 24.5 95.6 1,071 1,104 159 3,562

Table 2: Statistics for Subtask A.

We then identified popular topics as those named
entities that are frequently mentioned in association
with a specific date (Ritter et al., 2012). Given this
set of automatically identified topics, we gathered
tweets from the same time period which mentioned
the named entities. The testing messages had differ-
ent topics from training and spanned later periods.

To identify messages that express sentiment to-
wards these topics, we filtered the tweets us-
ing SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). We
removed messages that contained no sentiment-
bearing words, keeping only those with at least one
word with positive or negative sentiment score that
is greater than 0.3 in SentiWordNet for at least one
sense of the words. Without filtering, we found class
imbalance to be too high.3

Twitter messages are rich in social media features,
including out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, emoti-
cons, and acronyms; see Table 1. A large portion of
the OOV words are hashtags (e.g., #sheenroast)
and mentions (e.g., @tash jade).

3Filtering based on an existing lexicon does bias the dataset
to some degree; however, note that the text still contains senti-
ment expressions outside those in the lexicon.

Corpus Positive Negative Objective

Twitter - Training 3,662 1,466 4,600
Twitter - Dev 575 340 739
Twitter - Test 1,573 601 1,640
SMS - Test 492 394 1,208

Table 3: Statistics for Subtask B.

We annotated the same Twitter messages with an-
notations for subtask A and subtask B. However,
the final training and testing datasets overlap only
partially between the two subtasks since we had
to throw away messages with low inter-annotator
agreement, and this differed between the subtasks.
For testing, we also annotated SMS messages, taken
from the NUS SMS corpus4 (Chen and Kan, 2012).
Tables 2 and 3 show statistics about the corpora we
created for subtasks A and B.

Table 4: Bounds for datasets in subtasks A and B.

3.2 Annotation Guidelines
The instructions provided to the annotators, along
with an example, are shown in Figure 1. We pro-
vided several additional examples to the annotators,
shown in Table 5.

In addition, we filtered spammers by considering
the following kinds of annotations invalid:

• containing overlapping subjective phrases;
• subjective but without a subjective phrase;
• marking every single word as subjective;
• not having the overall sentiment marked.

3.3 Annotation Process
Our datasets were annotated for sentiment on Me-
chanical Turk. Each sentence was annotated by five
Mechanical Turk workers (Turkers). In order to
qualify for the hits, the Turker had to have an ap-
proval rate greater than 95% and have completed 50
approved hits. Each Turker was paid three cents
per hit. The Turker had to mark all the subjec-
tive words/phrases in the sentence by indicating their
start and end positions and say whether each subjec-
tive word/phrase was positive, negative, or neutral
(subtask A). They also had to indicate the overall
polarity of the sentence (subtask B).

Figure 1 shows the instructions and an exam-
ple provided to the Turkers. The first five rows
of Table 6 show an example of the subjective
words/phrases marked by each of the workers.

For subtask A, we combined the annotations of
each of the workers using intersection as indicated
in the last row of Table 6. A word had to appear
in 2/3 of the annotations in order to be considered
subjective. Similarly, a word had to be labeled with
a particular polarity (positive, negative, or neutral)
2/3 of the time in order to receive that label.

We also experimented with combining annota-
tions by computing the union of the sentences, and
taking the sentence of the worker who annotated the
most hits, but we found that these methods were
not as accurate. Table 4 shows the lower, average,
and upper bounds for all the hits by computing the
bounds for each hit and averaging them together.
This gives a good indication about how well we can
expect the systems to perform. For example, even if
we used the best annotator each time, it would still
not be possible to get perfect accuracy.

For subtask B, the polarity of the entire sentence
was determined based on the majority of the labels.
If there was a tie, the sentence was discarded. In
order to reduce the number of sentences lost, we
combined the objective and the neutral labels, which
Turkers tended to mix up. Table 4 shows the aver-
age bound for subtask B by computing the bounds
for each hit and averaging them together. Since the
polarity is chosen based on the majority, the upper
bound is 100%.

4 Scoring

For both subtasks, the participating systems were
required to perform a three-way classification – a
particular marked phrase (for subtask A) or an en-
tire message (for subtask B) was to be classified as
positive, negative, or objective. For each system,
we computed a score for predicting positive/negative
phrases/messages vs. the other two classes.

For instance, to compute positive precision, Ppos,
we find the number of phrases/messages that a sys-
tem correctly predicted to be positive, and we divide
that number by the total number of messages it pre-
dicted to be positive. To compute recall, for the pos-
itive class, Rpos, we find the number of messages
correctly predicted to be positive and we divide that
number by the total number of positive messages in
the gold standard.

We then calculate F-score for the positive labels,
the harmonic average of precision and recall as fol-
lows Fpos = 2

PposRpos
Ppos+Rpos

. We carry out a similar
computation to calculate Fneg, which is F1 for neg-
ative messages.

The overall score for each system run is then
given by the average of the F1-scores for the posi-
tive and negative classes: F = (Fpos + Fneg)/2.

Table 6: Example of a sentence annotated for subjectivity on Mechanical Turk. Words and phrases that were marked as
subjective are italicized and highlighted in bold. The first five rows are annotations provided by Turkers, and the final
row shows their intersection. The final column shows the accuracy for each annotation compared to the intersection.

Note that ignoring Fneutral does not reduce the
task to predicting positive vs. negative labels only
(even though some participants have chosen to do
so) since the gold standard still contains neutral
labels which are to be predicted: Fpos and Fneg
would suffer if these examples are labeled as posi-
tive and/or negative instead of neutral.

We provided participants with a scorer. In addi-
tion to outputting the overall F-score, it produced
a confusion matrix for the three prediction classes
(positive, negative, and objective), and it also vali-
dated the data submission format.

5 Participants and Results

The results for subtask A are shown in Tables 7 and
8 for Twitter and for SMS messages, respectively;
those for subtask B are shown in Table 9 for Twit-
ter and in Table 10 for SMS messages. Systems are
ranked by their scores for the constrained runs; the
ranking based on scores for unconstrained runs is
shown as a subindex.

For both subtasks, there were teams that only sub-
mitted results for the Twitter test set. Some teams
submitted both a constrained and an unconstrained
version (e.g., AVAYA and teragram). As one would
expect, the results on the Twitter test set tended to be
better than those on the SMS test set since the SMS
data was out-of-domain with respect to the training
(Twitter) data.

Moreover, the results for subtask A were signifi-
cantly better than those for subtask B, which shows
that it is a much easier task, probably because there
is less ambiguity at the phrase-level.

5.1 Subtask A: Contextual Polarity
Table 7 shows that subtask A, Twitter, attracted 23
teams, who submitted 21 constrained and 7 uncon-
strained systems. Five teams submitted both a con-
strained and an unconstrained system, and two other
teams submitted constrained systems that are on
the boundary between being constrained and uncon-
strained.

One system was semi-supervised, and the rest
were supervised. The supervised systems used clas-
sifiers such as SVM (8 systems), Naive Bayes (7 sys-
tems), and Maximum Entropy (3 systems). Other
approaches used include an ensemble of classifiers,
manual rules, and a linear classifier. Two of the sys-
tems chose not to predict neutral as a possible clas-
sification label.

The average F1-measure on the Twitter test set
was 74.1% for constrained systems and 60.5% for
unconstrained ones; this does not mean that using
additional data does not help, it just shows that the
best teams only participated with a constrained sys-
tem. NRC-Canada had the best constrained system
with an F1-measure of 88.9%, and AVAYA had the
best unconstrained one with F1=87.4%.

strained and 54.6% for the unconstrained systems.

These averages are much lower than those for sub-

probably because a message can contain parts ex-
pressing both positive and negative sentiment.

Once again, NRC-Canada had the best con-

lowed by teragram, which had the best uncon-
strained system with an F1-measure of 64.9%.

As Table 10 shows, the average F1-measure on
the SMS test set was 50.2% for constrained and
50.3% for unconstrained systems. NRC-Canada had
the best constrained system with an F1=68.5%, and
AVAYA had the best unconstrained one with F1-
measure of 59.5%.

5.3 Overall
Overall, the results achieved by the best teams were
very strong, especially for the simpler subtask A:

• F1=88.93, NRC-Canada on subtask A, Twitter;

• F1=88.37, GU-MLT-LT on subtask A, SMS;

• F1=69.02, NRC-Canada on subtask B, Twitter;

• F1=68.46, NRC-Canada on subtask B, SMS.

We can see that the strongest team overall was that
of NRC-Canada, which was ranked first on three of
the four conditions; and it was second on subtask A,
SMS. There were two other teams that were strong
across both tasks and on both test sets: GU-MLT-LT
and AVAYA. Three other teams, namely teragram,
BOUNCE and KLUE, were ranked in the top-3 in at
least one subtask and test set.

6 Discussion

We have seen that most participants restricted them-
selves to the provided data and submitted con-
strained systems. Indeed, the best systems for each
of the two subtasks and for each of the two testing
datasets were constrained systems; of course, this
does not mean that additional data would not be use-
ful. Curiously, in some cases where a team submit-
ted a constrained and unconstrained run, the uncon-
strained run actually performed worse.

Not surprisingly, most systems were supervised;
there were only five semi-supervised systems, and
there was only one unsupervised system. One ad-
ditional team declared their system as unsupervised
since it was not making use of the training data; we
still classified it as supervised though since it did use
supervision – in the form of manual rules.

Most participants predicted all three labels (posi-
tive, negative and neutral), even though some partic-
ipants opted for not predicting neutral, which made
some sense since the final F1-score was averaged
over the positive and the negative predictions only.

The most popular classifiers included SVM, Max-
Ent, linear classifier, Naive Bayes; in some cases,
manual rules or ensembles of classifiers were used.

A variety of features were used, including word-
related (e.g., words, stems, n-grams, word clus-
ters), word-shape (e.g., punctuation, capitalization),

syntactic (e.g., POS tags, dependency relations),
Twitter-specific (e.g., repeated characters, emoti-
cons, URLs, hashtags, slang, abbreviations), and
sentiment-related (e.g., negation); one team also
used discourse relations. Almost all participants re-
lied heavily of various sentiment lexicons, the most
popular ones being MPQA and SentiWordNet, as
well as AFINN and Bing Liu’s Opinion Lexicon;
some participants used their own lexicons – preex-
isting or built from the provided data.

Given that Twitter messages are noisy, most par-
ticipants did some preprocessing, including tok-
enization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword re-
moval, normalization/removal of URLs, hashtags,
users, slang, emoticons, repeated vowels, punctua-
tion; some even did pronoun resolution.

7 Conclusion

We have described a new task that entered SemEval-
2013: task 2 on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter. The
task has attracted a very high number of participants:
149 submissions from 44 teams.

We believe that the datasets that we have created
as part of the task and which we have released to the
community5 under a Creative Commons Attribution
3.0 Unported License,6 will be found useful by re-
searchers beyond SemEval.
