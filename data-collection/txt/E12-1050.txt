Abstract
We present experiments with part-of-
speech tagging for Bulgarian, a Slavic lan-
guage with rich inflectional and deriva-
tional morphology. Unlike most previous
work, which has used a small number of
grammatical categories, we work with 680
morpho-syntactic tags. We combine a large
morphological lexicon with prior linguis-
tic knowledge and guided learning from a
POS-annotated corpus, achieving accuracy
of 97.98%, which is a significant improve-
ment over the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian.

1 Introduction

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the task of as-
signing each of the words in a given piece of text a
contextually suitable grammatical category. This
is not trivial since words can play different syn-
tactic roles in different contexts, e.g., can is a
noun in “I opened a can of coke.” but a verb in
“I can write.” Traditionally, linguists have classi-
fied English words into the following eight basic
POS categories: noun, pronoun, adjective, verb,
adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection;
this list is often extended a bit, e.g., with deter-
miners, particles, participles, etc., but the number
of categories considered is rarely more than 15.

Computational linguistics works with a larger
inventory of POS tags, e.g., the Penn Treebank
(Marcus et al., 1993) uses 48 tags: 36 for part-
of-speech, and 12 for punctuation and currency
symbols. This increase in the number of tags
is partially due to finer granularity, e.g., there
are special tags for determiners, particles, modal
verbs, cardinal numbers, foreign words, existen-
tial there, etc., but also to the desire to encode
morphological information as part of the tags.

For example, there are six tags for verbs in the
Penn Treebank: VB (verb, base form; e.g., sing),
VBD (verb, past tense; e.g., sang), VBG (verb,
gerund or present participle; e.g., singing), VBN
(verb, past participle; e.g., sung) VBP (verb, non-
3rd person singular present; e.g., sing), and VBZ
(verb, 3rd person singular present; e.g., sings);
these tags are morpho-syntactic in nature. Other
corpora have used even larger tagsets, e.g., the
Brown corpus (Kučera and Francis, 1967) and the
Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus (Johansson
et al., 1986) use 87 and 135 tags, respectively.

POS tagging poses major challenges for mor-
phologically complex languages, whose tagsets
encode a lot of additional morpho-syntactic fea-
tures (for most of the basic POS categories), e.g.,
gender, number, person, etc. For example, the
BulTreeBank (Simov et al., 2004) for Bulgarian
uses 680 tags, while the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (Hajič, 1998) for Czech has over 1,400 tags.

Below we present experiments with POS tag-
ging for Bulgarian, which is an inflectional lan-
guage with rich morphology. Unlike most previ-
ous work, which has used a reduced set of POS
tags, we use all 680 tags in the BulTreeBank. We
combine prior linguistic knowledge and statistical
learning, achieving accuracy comparable to that
reported for state-of-the-art systems for English.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 provides an overview of related
work, Section 3 describes Bulgarian morphology,
Section 4 introduces our approach, Section 5 de-
scribes the datasets, Section 6 presents our exper-
iments in detail, Section 7 discusses the results,
Section 8 offers application-specific error analy-
sis, and Section 9 concludes and points to some
promising directions for future work.

2 Related Work

Most research on part-of-speech tagging has fo-
cused on English, and has relied on the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al., 1993) and its tagset for train-
ing and evaluation. The task is typically addressed
as a sequential tagging problem; one notable ex-
ception is the work of Brill (1995), who proposed
non-sequential transformation-based learning.

A number of different sequential learning
frameworks have been tried, yielding 96-97%
accuracy: Lafferty et al. (2001) experimented
with conditional random fields (CRFs) (95.7%
accuracy), Ratnaparkhi (1996) used a maximum
entropy sequence classifier (96.6% accuracy),
Brants (2000) employed a hidden Markov model
(96.6% accuracy), Collins (2002) adopted an av-
eraged perception discriminative sequence model
(97.1% accuracy). All these models fix the order
of inference from left to right.

Toutanova et al. (2003) introduced a cyclic de-
pendency network (97.2% accuracy), where the
search is bi-directional. Shen et al. (2007) have
further shown that better results (97.3% accu-
racy) can be obtained using guided learning, a
framework for bidirectional sequence classifica-
tion, which integrates token classification and in-
ference order selection into a single learning task
and uses a perceptron-like (Collins and Roark,
2004) passive-aggressive classifier to make the
easiest decisions first. Recently, Tsuruoka et al.
(2011), proposed a simple perceptron-based clas-
sifier applied from left to right but augmented
with a lookahead mechanism that searches the
space of future actions, yielding 97.3% accuracy.

For morphologically complex languages, the
problem of POS tagging typically includes mor-
phological disambiguation, which yields a much
larger number of tags. For example, for Arabic,
Habash and Rambow (2005) used support vector
machines (SVM), achieving 97.6% accuracy with
139 tags from the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et
al., 2003). For Czech, Hajič et al. (2001) com-
bined a hidden Markov model (HMM) with lin-
guistic rules, which yielded 95.2% accuracy using
an inventory of over 1,400 tags from the Prague
Dependency Treebank (Hajič, 1998). For Ice-
landic, Dredze and Wallenberg (2008) reported
92.1% accuracy with 639 tags developed for the
Icelandic frequency lexicon (Pind et al., 1991),
they used guided learning and tag decomposition:

First, a coarse POS class is assigned (e.g., noun,
verb, adjective), then, additional fine-grained
morphological features like case, number and
gender are added, and finally, the proposed tags
are further reconsidered using non-local features.
Similarly, Smith et al. (2005) decomposed the
complex tags into factors, where models for pre-
dicting part-of-speech, gender, number, case, and
lemma are estimated separately, and then com-
posed into a single CRF model; this yielded com-
petitive results for Arabic, Korean, and Czech.

Most previous work on Bulgarian POS tagging
has started with large tagsets, which were then
reduced. For example, Dojchinova and Mihov
(2004) mapped their initial tagset of 946 tags to
just 40, which allowed them to achieve 95.5%
accuracy using the transformation-based learning
of Brill (1995), and 98.4% accuracy using manu-
ally crafted linguistic rules. Similarly, Georgiev
et al. (2009), who used maximum entropy and
the BulTreeBank (Simov et al., 2004), grouped
its 680 fine-grained POS tags into 95 coarse-
grained ones, and thus improved their accuracy
from 90.34% to 94.4%. Simov and Osenova
(2001) used a recurrent neural network to predict
(a) 160 morpho-syntactic tags (92.9% accuracy)
and (b) 15 POS tags (95.2% accuracy).

Some researchers did not reduce the tagset:
Savkov et al. (2011) used 680 tags (94.7% ac-
curacy), and Tanev and Mitkov (2002) used 303
tags and the BULMORPH morphological ana-
lyzer (Krushkov, 1997), achieving P=R=95%.

3 Bulgarian Morphology

Bulgarian is an Indo-European language from the
Slavic language group, written with the Cyrillic
alphabet and spoken by about 9-12 million peo-
ple. It is also a member of the Balkan Sprachbund
and thus differs from most other Slavic languages:
it has no case declensions, uses a suffixed definite
article (which has a short and a long form for sin-
gular masculine), and lacks verb infinitive forms.
It further uses special evidential verb forms to ex-
press unwitnessed, retold, and doubtful activities.

Bulgarian is an inflective language with very
rich morphology. For example, Bulgarian verbs
have 52 synthetic wordforms on average, while
pronouns have altogether more than ten grammat-
ical features (not necessarily shared by all pro-
nouns), including case, gender, person, number,
definiteness, etc.

493



This rich morphology inevitably leads to ambi-
guity proliferation; our analysis of BulTreeBank
shows four major types of ambiguity:

1. Between the wordforms of the same lexeme,
i.e., in the paradigm. For example, divana,
an inflected form of divan (‘sofa’, mascu-
line), can mean (a) ‘the sofa’ (definite, singu-
lar, short definite article) or (b) a count form,
e.g., as in dva divana (‘two sofas’).

2. Between two or more lexemes, i.e., conver-
sion. For example, kato can be (a) a subor-
dinator meaning ‘as, when’, or (b) a preposi-
tion meaning ‘like, such as’.

3. Between a lexeme and an inflected wordform
of another lexeme, i.e., across-paradigms.
For example, politika can mean (a) ‘the
politician’ (masculine, singular, definite,
short definite article) or (b) ‘politics’ (fem-
inine, singular, indefinite).

4. Between the wordforms of two or more
lexemes, i.e., across-paradigms and quasi-
conversion. For example, vrvi can mean
(a) ‘walks’ (verb, 2nd or 3rd person, present
tense) or (b) ‘strings, laces’ (feminine, plu-
ral, indefinite).

Some morpho-syntactic ambiguities in Bulgar-
ian are occasional, but many are systematic, e.g.,
neuter singular adjectives have the same forms
as adverbs. Overall, most ambiguities are local,
and thus arguably resolvable using n-grams, e.g.,
compare hubavo dete (‘beautiful child’), where
hubavo is a neuter adjective, and “Pe� hubavo.”
(‘I sing beautifully.’), where it is an adverb of
manner. Other ambiguities, however, are non-
local and may require discourse-level analysis,
e.g., “Vid�h go.” can mean ‘I saw him.’, where
go is a masculine pronoun, or ’I saw it.’, where
it is a neuter pronoun. Finally, there are ambi-
guities that are very hard or even impossible1 to
resolve, e.g., “Deteto vleze veselo.” can mean
both ‘The child came in happy.’ (veselo is an ad-
jective) and ‘The child came in happily.’ (it is an
adverb); however, the latter is much more likely.

1The problem also exists for English, e.g., the annotators
of the Penn Treebank were allowed to use tag combinations
for inherently ambiguous cases: JJ|NN (adjective or noun as
prenominal modifier), JJ|VBG (adjective or gerund/present
participle), JJ|VBN (adjective or past participle), NN|VBG
(noun or gerund), and RB|RP (adverb or particle).

In many cases, strong domain preferences exist
about how various systematic ambiguities should
be resolved. We made a study for the newswire
domain, analyzing a corpus of 546,029 words,
and we found that ambiguity type 2 (lexeme-
lexeme) prevailed for functional parts-of-speech,
while the other types were more frequent for in-
flecting parts-of-speech. Below we show the most
frequent types of morpho-syntactic ambiguities
and their frequency in our corpus:

• na: preposition (‘of’) vs. emphatic particle,
with a ratio of 28,554 to 38;

• da: auxiliary particle (‘to’) vs. affirmative
particle, with a ratio of 12,035 to 543;

• e: 3rd person present auxiliary verb (‘to be’)
vs. particle (‘well’) vs. interjection (‘wow’),
with a ratio of 9,136 to 21 to 5;

• singular masculine noun with a short definite
article vs. count form of a masculine noun,
with a ratio of 6,437 to 1,592;

• adverb vs. neuter singular adjective, with a
ratio of 3,858 to 1,753.

Overall, the following factors should be taken
into account when modeling Bulgarian morpho-
syntax: (1) locality vs. non-locality of grammat-
ical features, (2) interdependence of grammatical
features, and (3) domain-specific preferences.

4 Method

We used the guided learning framework described
in (Shen et al., 2007), which has yielded state-of-
the-art results for English and has been success-
fully applied to other morphologically complex
languages such as Icelandic (Dredze and Wallen-
berg, 2008); we found it quite suitable for Bul-
garian as well. We used the feature set defined in
(Shen et al., 2007), which includes the following:

1. The feature set of Ratnaparkhi (1996), in-
cluding prefix, suffix and lexical, as well as
some bigram and trigram context features;

2. Feature templates as in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996),
which have been shown helpful in bidirec-
tional search;

3. More bigram and trigram features and bi-
lexical features as in (Shen et al., 2007).

Note that we allowed prefixes and suffixes of
length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al., 2003) and
(Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).

494



We further extended the set of features with
the tags proposed for the current word token by a
morphological lexicon, which maps words to pos-
sible tags; it is exhaustive, i.e., the correct tag is
always among the suggested ones for each token.

We also used 70 linguistically-motivated, high-
precision rules in order to further reduce the num-
ber of possible tags suggested by the lexicon.
The rules are similar to those proposed by Hin-
richs and Trushkina (2004) for German; we im-
plemented them as constraints in the CLaRK sys-
tem (Simov et al., 2003).

Here is an example of a rule: If a wordform
is ambiguous between a masculine count noun
(Ncmt) and a singular short definite masculine
noun (Ncmsh), the Ncmt tag should be chosen if
the previous token is a numeral or a number.

The 70 rules were developed by linguists based
on observations over the training dataset only.
They target primarily the most frequent cases of
ambiguity, and to a lesser extent some infrequent
but very problematic cases. Some rules operate
over classes of words, while other refer to partic-
ular wordforms. The rules were designed to be
100% accurate on our training dataset; our exper-
iments show that they are also 100% accurate on
the test and on the development dataset.

Note that some of the rules are dependent on
others, and thus the order of their cascaded appli-
cation is important. For example, the wordform �
is ambiguous between an accusative feminine sin-
gular short form of a personal pronoun (‘her’) and
an interjection (‘wow’). To handle this properly,
the rule for interjection, which targets sentence
initial positions, followed by a comma, needs to
be executed first. The rule for personal pronouns
is only applied afterwards.

Table 1: Sample fragment showing the possible tags
suggested by the lexicon. The tags that are further
filtered by the rules are in italic; the correct tag is bold.

The rules are quite efficient at reducing the POS
ambiguity. On the test dataset, before the rule ap-
plication, 34.2% of the tokens (excluding punctu-
ation) had more than one tag in our morphological
lexicon. This number is reduced to 18.5% after
the cascaded application of the 70 linguistic rules.
Table 1 illustrates the effect of the rules on a small
sentence fragment. In this example, the rules have
left only one tag (the correct one) for three of the
ambiguous words. Since the rules in essence de-
crease the average number of tags per token, we
calculated that the lexicon suggests 1.6 tags per
token on average, and after the application of the
rules this number decreases to 1.44 per token.

5 Datasets

5.1 BulTreeBank
We used the latest version of the BulTree-
Bank (Simov and Osenova, 2004), which contains
20,556 sentences and 321,542 word tokens (four
times less than the English Penn Treebank), anno-
tated using a total of 680 unique morpho-syntactic
tags. See (Simov et al., 2004) for a detailed de-
scription of the BulTreeBank tagset.

We split the data into training/development/test
as shown in Table 2. Note that only 552 of all 680
tag types were used in the training dataset, and
the development and the test datasets combined
contain a total of 128 new tag types that were not
seen in the training dataset. Moreover, 32% of the
word types in the development dataset and 31%
of those in the testing dataset do not occur in the
training dataset. Thus, data sparseness is an issue
at two levels: word-level and tag-level.

Dataset Sentences Tokens Types Tags

Dev 2,007 32,995 9,635 425
Test 2,017 35,021 9,627 435

Table 2: Statistics about our datasets.

5.2 Morphological Lexicon
In order to alleviate the data sparseness issues,
we further used a large morphological lexicon for
Bulgarian, which is an extended version of the
dictionary described in (Popov et al., 1998) and
(Popov et al., 2003). It contains over 1.5M in-
flected wordforms (for 110K lemmata and 40K
proper names), each mapped to a set of possible
morpho-syntactic tags.

6 Experiments and Evaluation

State-of-the-art POS taggers for English typically
build a lexicon containing all tags a word type has
taken in the training dataset; this lexicon is then
used to limit the set of possible tags that an input
token can be assigned, i.e., it imposes a hard con-
straint on the possibilities explored by the POS
tagger. For example, if can has only been tagged
as a verb and as a noun in the training dataset,
it will be only assigned those two tags at test
time; other tags such as adjective, adverb and pro-
noun will not be considered. Out-of-vocabulary
words, i.e., those that were not seen in the train-
ing dataset, are constrained as well, e.g., to a small
set of frequent open-class tags.

In our experiments, we used a morphological
lexicon that is much larger than what could be
built from the training corpus only: building a
lexicon from the training corpus only is of lim-
ited utility since one can hardly expect to see in
the training corpus all 52 synthetic forms a verb
can possibly have. Moreover, we did not use the
tags listed in the lexicon as hard constraints (ex-
cept in one of our baselines); instead, we experi-
mented with a different, non-restrictive approach:
we used the lexicon’s predictions as features or
soft constraints, i.e., as suggestions only, thus al-
lowing each token to take any possible tag. Note
that for both known and out-of-vocabulary words
we used all 680 tags rather than the 552 tags ob-
served in the training dataset; we could afford to
explore this huge search space thanks to the effi-
ciency of the guided learning framework. Allow-
ing all 680 tags on training helped the model by
exposing it to a larger set of negative examples.

We combined these lexicon features with stan-
dard features extracted from the training corpus.
We further experimented with the 70 contextual
linguistic rules, using them (a) as soft and (b) as
hard constraints. Finally, we set four baselines:
three that do not use the lexicon and one that does.

Accuracy (%)
# Baselines (token-level)
1 MFT + unknowns are wrong 78.10
2 MFT + unknowns are Ncmsi 78.52
3 MFT + guesser for unknowns 79.49
4 MFT + lexicon tag-classes 94.40

Table 3: Most-frequent-tag (MFT) baselines.

6.1 Baselines

First, we experimented with the most-frequent-
tag baseline, which is standard for POS tagging.
This baseline ignores context altogether and as-
signs each word type the POS tag it was most
frequently seen with in the training dataset; ties
are broken randomly. We coped with word types
not seen in the training dataset using three sim-
ple strategies: (a) we considered them all wrong,
(b) we assigned them Ncmsi, which is the most
frequent open-class tag in the training dataset, or
(c) we used a very simple guesser, which assigned
Ncfsi, Ncnsi, Ncfsi, and Ncmsf, if the target word
ended by -a, -o, -i, and -t, respectively, other-
wise, it assigned Ncmsi. The results are shown
in lines 1-3 of Table 3: we can see that the token-
level accuracy ranges in 78-80% for (a)-(c), which
is relatively high, given that we use a large inven-
tory of 680 morpho-syntactic tags.

We further tried a baseline that uses the above-
described morphological lexicon, in addition to
the training dataset. We first built two frequency
lists, containing respectively (1) the most frequent
tag in the training dataset for each word type, as
before, and (2) the most frequent tag in the train-
ing dataset for each class of tags that can be as-
signed to some word type, according to the lexi-
con. For example, the most frequent tag for poli-
tika is Ncfsi, and the most frequent tag for the
tag-class {Ncmt;Ncmsi} is Ncmt.

Given a target word type, this new baseline first
tries to assign it the most frequent tag from the
first list. If this is not possible, which happens
(i) in case of ties or (ii) when the word type was
not seen on training, it extracts the tag-class from
the lexicon and consults the second list. If there
is a single most frequent tag in the corpus for this
tag-class, it is assigned; otherwise a random tag
from this tag-class is selected.

Line 4 of Table 3 shows that this latter baseline
achieves a very high accuracy of 94.40%. Note,
however, that this is over-optimistic: the lexicon
contains a tag-class for each word type in our test-
ing dataset, i.e., while there can be word types
not seen in the training dataset, there are no word
types that are not listed in the lexicon. Thus, this
high accuracy is probably due to a large extent
to the scale and quality of our morphological lexi-
con, and it might not be as strong with smaller lex-
icons; we plan to investigate this in future work.

6.2 Lexicon Tags as Soft Constraints

We experimented with three types of features:

1. Word-related features only;

2. Word-related features + the tags suggested
by the lexicon;

3. Word-related features + the tags suggested
by the lexicon but then further filtered using
the 70 contextual linguistic rules.

Table 4 shows the sentence-level and the token-
level accuracy on the test dataset for the three
kinds of features: shown on lines 1, 3 and 4, re-
spectively. We can see that using the tags pro-
posed by the lexicon as features (lines 3 and 4)
has a major positive impact, yielding up to 49%
error reduction at the token-level and up to 37%
at the sentence-level, as compared to using word-
related features alone (line 1).

Interestingly, filtering the tags proposed by the
lexicon using the 70 contextual linguistic rules
yields a minor decrease in accuracy both at the
word token-level and at the sentence-level (com-
pare line 4 to line 2). This is surprising since
the linguistic rules are extremely reliable: they
were designed to be 100% accurate on the train-
ing dataset, and we found them experimentally to
be 100% correct on the development and on the
testing dataset as well.

One possible explanation is that by limiting the
set of available tags for a given token at training
time, we prevent the model from observing some
potentially useful negative examples. We tested
this hypothesis by using the unfiltered lexicon
predictions at training time but then making use
of the filtered ones at testing time; the results are
shown on line 5. We can observe a small increase
in accuracy compared to line 4: from 97.80% to
97.84% at the token-level, and from 70.30% to
70.40% at the sentence-level. Although these dif-
ferences are tiny, they suggest that having more
negative examples at training is helpful.

We can conclude that using the lexicon as a
source of soft constraints has a major positive im-
pact, e.g., because it provides access to impor-
tant external knowledge that is complementary
to what can be learned from the training corpus
alone; the improvements when using linguistic
rules as soft constraints are more limited.

6.3 Linguistic Rules as Hard Constraints
Next, we experimented with using the suggestions
of the linguistic rules as hard constraints. Table 4
shows that this is a very good idea. Comparing
line 1 to line 2, which do not use the morpholog-
ical lexicon, we can see very significant improve-
ments: from 95.72% to 97.20% at the token-level
and from 52.95% to 64.50% at the sentence-level.
The improvements are smaller but still consistent
when the morphological lexicon is used: compar-
ing lines 3 and 4 to lines 6 and 7, respectively, we
see an improvement from 97.83% to 97.91% and
from 97.80% to 97.93% at the token-level, and
about 1% absolute at the sentence-level.

6.4 Increasing the Beam Size
Finally, we increased the beam size of guided
learning from 1 to 3 as in (Shen et al., 2007).
Comparing line 7 to line 8 in Table 4, we can see
that this yields further token-level improvement:
from 97.93% to 97.98%.

7 Discussion

Table 5 compares our results to previously re-
ported evaluation results for Bulgarian. The
first four lines show the token-level accuracy for
standard POS tagging tools trained and evalu-
ated on the BulTreeBank:2 TreeTagger (Schmid,
1994), which uses decision trees, TnT (Brants,
2000), which uses a hidden Markov model,
SVMtool (Giménez and Màrquez, 2004), which
is based on support vector machines, and
ACOPOST (Schröder, 2002), implementing the
memory-based model of Daelemans et al. (1996).
The following lines report the token-level accu-
racy reported in previous work, as compared to
our own experiments using guided learning.

We can see that we outperform by a very large
margin (92.53% vs. 97.98%, which represents
73% error reduction) the systems from the first
four lines, which are directly comparable to our
experiments: they are trained and evaluated on the
BulTreeBank using the full inventory of 680 tags.

We further achieved statistically significant im-
provement (p < 0.0001; Pearson’s chi-squared
test (Plackett, 1983)) over the best pervious result
on 680 tags: from 94.65% to 97.98%, which rep-
resents 62.24% error reduction at the token-level.

2We used the pre-trained TreeTagger; for the rest, we re-
port the accuracy given on the Webpage of the BulTreeBank:

Table 4: Evaluation results on the test dataset. Line 1 shows the evaluation results when using features derived
from the text corpus only; these features are used by all systems in the table. Line 2 further uses the contextual
linguistic rules to limit the set of possible POS tags that can be predicted. Note that these rules (1) consult the
lexicon, and (2) always predict a single POS tag. Line 3 uses the POS tags listed in the lexicon as features, i.e.,
as soft suggestions only. Line 4 is like line 3, but the list of feature-tags proposed by the lexicon is filtered by
the contextual linguistic rules. Line 5 is like line 4, but the linguistic rules filtering is only applied at test time;
it is not done on training. Lines 6 and 7 are similar to lines 3 and 4, respectively, but here the linguistic rules
are further applied to limit the set of possible POS tags that can be predicted, i.e., the rules are used as hard
constraints. Finally, line 8 is like line 7, but here the beam size is increased to 3.

Overall, we improved over almost all previ-
ously published results. Our accuracy is sec-
ond only to the manual rules approach of Do-
jchinova and Mihov (2004). Note, however, that
they used 40 tags only, i.e., their inventory is 17
times smaller than ours. Moreover, they have op-
timized their tagset specifically to achieve very
high POS tagging accuracy by choosing not to at-
tempt to resolve some inherently hard systematic
ambiguities, e.g., they do not try to choose be-
tween second and third person past singular verbs,
whose inflected forms are identical in Bulgarian
and hard to distinguish when the subject is not
present (Bulgarian is a pro-drop language).

In order to compare our results more closely
to the smaller tagsets in Table 5, we evaluated
our best model with respect to (a) the first letter
of the tag only (which is part-of-speech only, no
morphological information; 13 tags), e.g., Ncmsf
becomes N, and (b) the first two letters of the
tag (POS + limited morphological information;
49 tags), e.g., Ncmsf becomes Nc. This yielded
99.30% accuracy for (a) and 98.85% for (b).
The latter improves over (Dojchinova and Mihov,
2004), while using a bit larger number of tags.

Our best token-level accuracy of 97.98% is
comparable and even slightly better than the state-
of-the-art results for English: 97.33% when using
Penn Treebank data only (Shen et al., 2007), and
97.50% for Penn Treebank plus some additional
unlabeled data (Søgaard, 2011). Of course, our
results are only indirectly comparable to English.

Still, our performance is impressive because
(1) our model is trained on 253,526 tokens only
while the standard training sections 0-18 of the
Penn Treebank contain a total of 912,344 tokens,
i.e., almost four times more, and (2) we predict
680 rather than just 48 tags as for the Penn Tree-
bank, which is 14 times more.

Note, however, that (1) we used a large exter-
nal morphological lexicon for Bulgarian, which
yielded about 50% error reduction (without it,
our accuracy was 95.72% only), and (2) our
train/dev/test sentences are generally shorter, and
thus arguably simpler for a POS tagger to analyze:
we have 17.4 words per test sentence in the Bul-
TreeBank vs. 23.7 in the Penn Treebank.

Our results also compare favorably to the state-
of-the-art results for other morphologically com-
plex languages that use large tagsets, e.g., 95.2%
for Czech with 1,400+ tags (Hajič et al., 2001),
92.1% for Icelandic with 639 tags (Dredze and
Wallenberg, 2008), 97.6% for Arabic with 139
tags (Habash and Rambow, 2005).

8 Error Analysis

In this section, we present error analysis with re-
spect to the impact of the POS tagger’s perfor-
mance on other processing steps in a natural lan-
guage processing pipeline, such as lemmatization
and syntactic dependency parsing.

First, we explore the most frequently confused
pairs of tags for our best-performing POS tagging
system; these are shown in Table 6.

Table 5: Comparison to previous work for Bulgarian. The first four lines report evaluation results for various
standard POS tagging tools, which were retrained and evaluated on the BulTreeBank. The following lines report
token-level accuracy for previously published work, as compared to our own experiments using guided learning.

We can see that most of the wrong tags share
the same part-of-speech (indicated by the initial
uppercase letter), such as V for verb, N for noun,
etc. This means that most errors refer to the mor-
phosyntactic features. For example, personal or
impersonal verb; definite or indefinite feminine
noun; singular or plural masculine adjective, etc.
At the same time, there are also cases, where the
error has to do with the part-of-speech label itself.
For example, between an adjective and an adverb,
or between a numeral and an indefinite pronoun.

We want to use the above tagger to develop
(1) a rule-based lemmatizer, using the morpholog-
ical lexicon, e.g., as in (Plisson et al., 2004), and
(2) a dependency parser like MaltParser (Nivre et
al., 2007), trained on the dependency part of the
BulTreeBank. We thus study the potential impact
of wrong tags on the performance of these tools.

The lemmatizer relies on the lexicon and uses
string transformation functions defined via two
operations – remove and concatenate:

if tag = Tag then
{remove OldEnd; concatenate NewEnd}

where Tag is the tag of the wordform, OldEnd is
the string that has to be removed from the end of
the wordform, and NewEnd is the string that has
to be concatenated to the beginning of the word-
form in order to produce the lemma.

Here is an example of such a rule:

if tag = Vpitf-o1s then
{remove oh; concatenate a}

The application of the above rule to the past
simple verb form qetoh (‘I read’) would remove
oh, and then concatenate a. The result would be
the correct lemma qeta (‘to read’).

Such rules are generated for each wordform in
the morphological lexicon; the above functional
representation allows for compact representation
in a finite state automaton. Similar rules are ap-
plied to the unknown words, where the lemma-
tizer tries to guess the correct lemma.

Obviously, the applicability of each rule cru-
cially depends on the output of the POS tagger.
If the tagger suggests the correct tag, then the
wordform would be lemmatized correctly. Note
that, in some cases of wrongly assigned POS tags
in a given context, we might still get the correct
lemma. This is possible in the majority of the
erroneous cases in which the part-of-speech has
been assigned correctly, but the wrong grammat-
ical alternative has been selected. In such cases,
the error does not influence lemmatization.

In order to calculate the proportion of such
cases, we divided each tag into two parts:
(a) grammatical features that are common for all
wordforms of a given lemma, and (b) features that
are specific to the wordform.

Table 6: Most frequently confused pairs of tags.

The part-of-speech features are always deter-
mined by the lemma. For example, Bulgarian
verbs have the lemma features aspect and tran-
sitivity. If they are correct, then the lemma is pre-
dicted also correctly, regardless of whether cor-
rect or wrong on the grammatical features. For
example, if the verb participle form (aorist or
imperfect) has its correct aspect and transitivity,
then it is lemmatized also correctly, regardless
of whether the imperfect or aorist features were
guessed correctly; similarly, for other error types.
We evaluated these cases for the 711 errors in our
experiment, and we found that 206 of them (about
29%) were non-problematic for lemmatization.

For the MaltParser, we encode most of the
grammatical features of the wordforms as spe-
cific features for the parser. Hence, it is much
harder to evaluate the problematic cases due to
the tagger. Still, we were able to make an es-
timation of some cases. Our strategy was to ig-
nore the grammatical features that do not always
contribute to the syntactic behavior of the word-
forms. Such grammatical features for the verbs
are aspect and tense. Thus, proposing perfective
instead of imperfective for a verb or present in-
stead of past tense would not cause problems for
the MaltParser. Among our 711 errors, 190 cases
(or about 27%) were not problematic for parsing.

Finally, we should note that there are two spe-
cial classes of tokens for which it is generally
hard to predict some of the grammatical features:
(1) abbreviations and (2) numerals written with
digits. In sentences, they participate in agreement
relations only if they are pronounced as whole
phrases; unfortunately, it is very hard for the tag-
ger to guess such relations since it does not have
at its disposal enough features, such as the inflec-
tion of the numeral form, that might help detect
and use the agreement pattern.

9 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented experiments with part-of-
speech tagging for Bulgarian, a Slavic language
with rich inflectional and derivational morphol-
ogy. Unlike most previous work for this language,
which has limited the number of possible tags, we
used a very rich tagset of 680 morpho-syntactic
tags as defined in the BulTreeBank. By com-
bining a large morphological lexicon with prior
linguistic knowledge and guided learning from a
POS-annotated corpus, we achieved accuracy of
97.98%, which is a significant improvement over
the state-of-the-art for Bulgarian. Our token-level
accuracy is also comparable to the best results re-
ported for English.

In future work, we want to experiment with a
richer set of features, e.g., derived from unlabeled
data (Søgaard, 2011) or from the Web (Umansky-
Pesin et al., 2010; Bansal and Klein, 2011). We
further plan to explore ways to decompose the
complex Bulgarian morpho-syntactic tags, e.g., as
proposed in (Simov and Osenova, 2001) and
(Smith et al., 2005). Modeling long-distance
syntactic dependencies (Dredze and Wallenberg,
2008) is another promising direction; we believe
this can be implemented efficiently using poste-
rior regularization (Graca et al., 2009) or expecta-
tion constraints (Bellare et al., 2009).
