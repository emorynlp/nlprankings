Abstract

Paraphrasing is expressing the same se-
mantic content using different linguistic
means. Although previous work has ad-
dressed linguistic variations at different
levels of language, paraphrasing in Turk-
ish has not been yet thoroughly studied.
This paper presents the first study towards
Turkish paraphrase alignment. We per-
form an analysis of different types of para-
phrases on a modest Turkish paraphrase
corpus and present preliminary results on
that analysis from different standpoints.
We also explore the impact of human in-
terpretation of paraphrasing on the align-
ment of paraphrase sentence pairs.

1 Introduction

Paraphrases are alternative linguistic expressions
that convey the same content. Natural languages
allow linguistic variations at different levels (e.g.,
lexical and phrasal) and a change at a level of lan-
guage may trigger other changes at different lev-
els. Paraphrasing has attracted a growing inter-
est from the research community in a broad range
of tasks such as language generation (Power and
Scott, 2005), machine translation (Callison-Burch
et al., 2006), and question answering (France
et al., 2003). Moreover, research on acquisi-
tion (Max et al., 2012), generation (Zhao et al.,
2010), and recognition (Qiu et al., 2006) of para-
phrases has been on the rise for the last decade.
Paraphrasing is also an increasingly studied prob-
lem by the generation community. One particular
text-to-text generation problem being addressed is
the generation of sentence-level paraphrases by
converting a sentence into a new one with approx-
imately the same meaning (Wubben et al., 2010).

One aspect of paraphrasing is the specifica-
tion of paraphrase types via a typology. Building
paraphrase typologies from different perspectives
(e.g., linguistics analysis and discourse analysis)
has been an active research area for a number of
years now (Vila et al., 2011). In particular, lin-
guistic grounds govern the typologies built by lan-
guage processing systems (Kozlowski et al., 2003)
which are often very generic or system specific.

Research on paraphrase alignment focuses on
identifying links between semantically related
word strings. Such monolingual alignments can
be later used as training data for several nat-
ural language processing approaches (e.g., tex-
tual entailment and multidocument summariza-
tion) (Thadani et al., 2012). Although a wealth
amount of research has studied various problems
related to Turkish, we here focus on a problem
which has not been studied earlier. We present our
initial explorations on Turkish paraphrase align-
ment by considering how alignment is affected by
human interpretation of paraphrasing. We con-
ducted a study on a modest corpus from four dif-
ferent sources to investigate answers to the follow-
ing questions: i) What are the types of paraphrases
that can be observed at different levels of Turk-
ish? ii) Do humans agree on the existence of para-
phrasing between Turkish paraphrase sentences?
iii) How does human interpretation of paraphras-
ing affect the alignment of paraphrase sentences?

Our study is unique in that it presents a generic
typology of paraphrase types found in our Turkish
paraphrase corpus and discusses the agreement of
human annotators on the identification and clas-
sification of observed correspondences between
paraphrases. This study also presents our aggre-
gated observations on the relation between inter-
pretation and alignment of paraphrase casts.

2 Paraphrase Corpora

The Turkish paraphrase corpus (Demir et al.,
2012) comprises 1270 paraphrase pairs from four
different sources: i) translations of a literary
text, ii) multiple reference translations of En-
glish tourism-related sentences, iii) news arti-
cles, and iv) subtitles of a movie. We mea-
sured sentence similarities of all paraphrase pairs
from each domain via three measures typically
used in statistical machine translation evaluations:
TER (Matthew Snover, 2006), BLEU (Papineni
et al., 2002), and METEOR (Lavie and Agar-
wal, 2007). As shown in Figure 1, the order-
ing of domains with respect to all metrics are the
same where the pairs from the news domain and
those from the parallel corpus are the most and the
least similar pairs respectively. Since there are di-
vergences across different domains, we randomly
drew from each domain an equal number of sen-
tences (i.e., 100 paraphrase pairs1). Some charac-
teristic features of the paraphrase pairs selected for
this study are shown in Table 1.

3 Paraphrase Typology

To our best knowledge, a Turkish paraphrase
typology that we can apply to this study does
not yet exist in the literature. On the other hand,
building a comprehensive typology is not one of
our objectives. There are a number of available
typologies built for English (Dras, 1999; Vila
et al., 2011). Since our focus in this work is on
characterizing paraphrasing at different levels of
language, we greatly drew from the linguistically-
motivated typology by Vila et al. (2011) while
building our generic typology. We examined the
selected 400 paraphrase pairs and constructed a
typology that covers all paraphrases occurring
within these pairs. Our typology covers three
levels of language and consists of four classes.

1The number of paraphrase pairs in the subtitle domain
limits the study to 100 pairs from each domain.

The lexical class covers all changes that arise
from exchanging words within a phrase with
other words and includes four subclasses (i.e.,
substitution, substitution with opposite polarity,
deletion, and pronominalization)2 :
(1) “Su bize takip edebileceğimiz hiçbir1 iz1
bırakmıyor1.” (Water leaves1 no1 trace1 that we
can follow.)
(2) “Su olayın takip edilebilecek bütün1 izlerini1
yok1 ediyor1.” (The water destroys1 all1 traces1
of the event that can be followed.)

The morphological class covers inflectional
and derivational changes within words and in-
cludes two subclasses (i.e., inflectional changes
and derivational changes):
(1) “Böyle bir ilaç almaktansa hasta1 kalmak1
iyidir.” (Staying1 sick1 is better than taking such a
drug.)
(2) “Hasta1 kalırım1 da yine de bu ilacı içmem.”(I1
stay1 sick1 still I don’t take this drug.)

The phrasal class includes changes that arise
from exchanging fragments with same meaning:
1) “Bunları biliyorum fakat emri ben1
vermedim1.” (I know all that, but I1 did1
not1 give1 the order.)
(2) “Bunları biliyorum ama, emri veren1 ben1
değilim1.” (I know all that, but I’m1 not1 the1
one1 who1 gave1 the order.)

The other class is for all other changes that
imply different lexicalizations for the same
contextual meaning:
(1) “Savaş çıkınca pek çok çingene eskilerdeki
gibi kötü1 kişiler1 oldular1.” (When war broke
out, many gypsies became1 just1 as bad1 people1
as those of the past.)
(2) “Savaşta birçok çingene eskiden olduğu gibi
yine çok1 kötülük1 yaptılar1.” (Many gypsies did1
much1 evil1 in the war again as in the past.)

2Each word in a paraphrase cast receives the same sub-
script.

189



Although these classes are language indepen-
dent, they include several Turkish specific as-
pects such as morphophonemic processes. For in-
stance, Turkish word changes due to vowel har-
mony, vowel drops, and consonant drops/changes
are all covered by the morphological class.

4 Paraphrase Alignment

While manually aligning the paraphrase sentence
pairs, our goal was to jointly identify the para-
phrase casts (i.e., the substitutable word strings)
and specify the types correspondences between
them. We asked three native speakers to align the
selected paraphrase sentences by aligning word
strings3 as much as possible and marking the
strength of observed correspondences as either
“certain” (the correspondences that hold in any
context) or “possible” (the correspondences that
are context-specific). The annotators were also
told to assign each identified correspondence be-
tween paraphrase casts to one of the classes in our
typology. In cases where the same word strings
were aligned, the correspondence was not classi-
fied with a class from the typology. Before align-
ing the corpus, the annotators were trained on a
different set of paraphrases using an annotation
guideline. Table 2 reports some statistics of the
alignment process. The column labelled as “Com-
mon” represents the alignments common to all an-
notators. The rows labelled as “C”, “P”, and “U”
represent the number of certain and possible align-
ments, and the number of unaligned words respec-
tively4. It is noteworthy that the percentage of
common certain alignments is significantly higher
than the percentage of common possible align-
ments in all domains.

5 Corpus Study Findings

In this study, we aim to explore whether hu-
mans agree on the existence (i.e., identifying two
word strings as paraphrases) and type of para-
phrasing between Turkish paraphrase sentences.
We are also interested in how the alignment of
paraphrase casts is affected from human inter-
pretation of paraphrasing between Turkish para-

3A word string consists of one or more words which may
not be contiguous. Two word strings are aligned when one or
more words in one string are paired with one or more words
in the other string.

cluding the alignments of the same word strings.

phrase sentences. Please note that the alignment
of paraphrase casts consequently affects the sen-
tence alignment of paraphrase sentence pairs.

Our analysis started with examining how often
our annotators agreed on identifying paraphrasing
between two word strings. The agreement scores
in Table 3 show that the annotators (pairwise) had
a reasonable level of agreement in all domains. In
majority of these cases, the annotators also agreed
on the strength of the correspondence (i.e., both
annotators either classified the correspondence as
“Certain-Certain” or “Possible-Possible”).

Subtitles 0.68% 0.72% 0.86%
Parallel Corpus 0.59% 0.61% 0.78%

Table 3: Agreement on paraphrase identification.

The agreement scores in Table 3 show the
agreement of annotators on the fact that two word
strings are paraphrases and thus should be aligned.
But it does not mean that the reason behind simi-
lar identifications is the same. We thus explored
whether the annotators similarly classified the
word strings that they identified as paraphrases. In
all domains, the agreement scores between the an-
notators (given in Table 4) are dramatically lower
than the scores in Table 3. It is particularly
noteworthy that the smallest drop is observed in
the parallel corpus domain (the domain that con-
tains the least similar sentences). In cases where
the annotators (pairwise) classified the same word
strings with the same paraphrase class, they had
a high agreement (between 78% and 91%) on the
strength of the correspondence in all domains. We
also computed the inter-annotator agreement via
Kappa (Cohen, 1960). Kappa scores (shown bold
in Table 4) represent fair to good agreement be-

Table 4: Agreement on paraphrase classes.

Figure 2 presents the distribution of paraphrase
classes identified by each annotator across differ-
ent domains. Notably, the identified paraphrase
classes between word strings appear to diverge in
several respects. We are currently exploring the
reason behind this poor annotator agreement on
paraphrase classes. One possible reason might be
different understanding of the typology.

As a second step, we explored the impact of
different interpretations of paraphrasing between
sentence pairs on the alignment of these sen-
tences. We analyzed the alignment differences of
sentences and classified them into four classes:

- Different Classification: Although both
annotators identify the same correspondence
between two word strings, they classify that
correspondence differently.
- Missing Alignment: One annotator identifies an
alignment between two word strings but the other
annotator does not identify a correspondence
between these word strings.
- Missing Word: The annotators identify a
correspondence of the same paraphrase class
between two word strings which differ only in one
word.
- Different Grouping: Two word strings are
identified as having a single correspondence
by one annotator whereas a number of disjoint

correspondences between these word strings are
identified by the other annotator.

All these differences except those classified as
“different classification” result in different align-
ments between word strings. Such different align-
ments of paraphrase casts then change the align-
ment of paraphrase sentences.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we present our initial explorations
on Turkish paraphrase alignment by exploiting a
modest corpus. We built a generic and linguisti-
cally grounded Turkish paraphrase typology that
covers the types of paraphrases observed in the
corpus. In the study, the paraphrases identified
by human annotators were aligned and annotated
with paraphrase classes from the typology. The
agreement of the annotators with respect to the ex-
istence and alignment of paraphrases as well as
the associated paraphrase classes were reported.
The study showed that the way how humans in-
terpret paraphrasing between Turkish paraphrase
sentences has an impact on how they align these
sentences.

We have two main directions for future re-
search: i) conducting a larger corpus study for
drawing generalizations about Turkish paraphras-
ing and enhancing the typology if necessary, and
ii) building Turkish paraphrase applications (e.g.,
automatic paraphrase acquisition) in correlation
with the collected insights. We believe that the
current findings for Turkish paraphrase alignment
and our corpus enriched with paraphrase types
enable future research on paraphrase phenomena
in different fields such as language generation,
textual entailment, summarization, and machine
translation to be empirically assessed.
