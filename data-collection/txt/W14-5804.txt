Abstract 

Knowledge representation is heavily based on using terminology, due to the fact that many terms have 

precise meanings in a specific domain but not in others. As a consequence, terms becomes unambiguous 

and clear, and at last, being useful for conceptualizations, are used as a starting point for formalizations. 

Starting from an analysis of problems in existing dictionaries, in this paper we present formalized Italian 

Linguistic Resources (LRs) for the Archaeological domain, in which we integrate/couple formal 

ontology classes and properties into/to electronic dictionary entries, using a standardized conceptual 

reference model. We also add Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) references in order to guarantee the 

interoperability between linguistic and language resources, and therefore to represent knowledge. 

1 Introduction 

Knowledge representation is heavily based on using terminology, due to the fact that many terms have 
precise meanings in a specific domain but not in others. As a consequence, terms becomes 
unambiguous and clear, and at last, being useful for conceptualizations, are used as a starting point for 
formalizations. Sowa (2000) notes that “most fields of science, engineering, business, and law have 
evolved systems of terminology or nomenclature for naming, classifying, and standardizing their 

concepts”. As well, Parts Of Speech (POS) present two levels of representation, which are separated 
but interlinked: a conceptual-semantic level, pertaining to ontologies, and a syntactic-semantic level, 
pertaining to sentence production. Starting from an analysis of problems in existing dictionaries, in 
this paper we present formalized Italian Linguistic Resources (LRs) for the Archaeological domain, in 
which we integrate/couple formal ontology classes and properties into/to electronic dictionary entries, 
using a standardized conceptual reference model. We also add Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) 
references in order to guarantee the interoperability between linguistic and language resources, and 

therefore to represent knowledge. 

2 Related Works 

Different models/mechanisms have been developed to overcome knowledge representation issues 
deriving from increasing complexity and diversity of linguistic resources. 

WordNet, one of the most widespread resource, is based on is-a, part-of and member-of relations 
between synsets, which are  used to represent concepts. At any rate, WordNet relations are not used in 

a consistent way, inasmuch sometimes they are broken or present redundancy (Martin, 2003). 
Rule based systems are usually founded on logical rules (Bender, 1996) and fuzzy rules (Zadeh, 

1965, 2004; Surmann, 2000). 
Generally speaking, the ontology-based approach deals with knowledge representation issues 

processing a set of words and their semantic relations in a certain domain (Gruber, 1993; Cocchiarella, 
1996; Brewster et al., 2004; Tijerino et al., 2005; Sanchez, 2010; Hao, 2010; Wang et al., 2011). 

We intend to develop a linguistic knowledge base, i.e. a lexical database, in which the ontology 
schema will be integrated to process language on the basis of syntactic relations, i.e. formal grammars.

3 Italian Linguistic Resources for the Archaeological Domain 

In order to develop our LRs, we apply Lexicon-Grammar (LG) theoretical and practical framework, 

which describes the mechanisms of word combinations and gives an exhaustive description of natural 
language lexical and syntactic structures. LG was set up by the French linguist Maurice Gross, during 
the ‘60s, and subsequently applied to Italian by Annibale Elia, Maurizio Martinelli and Emilio 
D'Agostino. All electronic dictionaries, built according to LG descriptive method, form the DELA1 
System, which works as a linguistic engine embedded in automatic textual analysis software systems 
and parsers2. Our LRs also include information taken from the Thesauri and Guidelines of the Italian 
Central Institute for the Catalogue and Documentation (ICCD)3.  

ICCD resources are organized in: 

 Object definition dictionary 

 Marble sculptures 

 Metal containers 

 Marble sculptures – Sarcophagi and reliefs 

 Vocabulary of Metals 

 Vocabulary of  Glasses 

 Vocabulary of Materials 

 Vocabulary of Mosaic Pavement Works 

 Vocabulary of non-figurative mosaics 

 Vocabulary of Mosaics 

 Vocabulary of Coroplastics. 
 

Only the Object definition dictionary provides, for each entry, the following different and structured 

information: Broader Term [BT], Broader Term Partitive [BTP1], Broader Term Partitive [BTP2], 
Narrower Term [NT], Narrower Term Partitive [NTP], Use [USE], Use For [UF]. 
 

 BT BTP1 BTP2 NT NTP USE UF 

amuleto  Strumenti 

Utensili e 

oggetti d'uso 

Amuleti e 

oggetti per 

uso 

cerimoniale, 

magico e 

votivo 

  a forma di anatra 

a forma di ariete 

a forma di colonna 

... 

 cornetto 

Table 1. An example of lemma categorization from ICCD dictionary 
 

Broader term fields indicate the taxonomy classification, so amuleto (amulet) is an element of 
Strumenti, Utensili e Oggetti d'uso (Tools), which is a general category, and Amuleti e oggetti per uso 
cerimoniale, magico e votivo (Magic & Votive Supplies), which is a specific category. 

The NTP field specifies the lemma, and this helps us to infer that amuleto occurs in different 
compound entries, for instance: amuleto a forma di anatra (duck amulet), amuleto a forma di ariete 
(ram amulet) and so on. UF is a no-preferential lemma (i.e. a variant); this implies that cornetto (horn 
amulet) can stand for amuleto (and its specific types), but ICCD guidelines suggest to use the first one. 

According to our approach, it is necessary to lemmatize all possible variants, including those having 
even a low-frequency use. 

Our electronic dictionary4, which represents an additional resource to the ICCD ones listed above, is 
composed by ca. 11000 entries, with both simple and compound words, including spelling variants, 
i.e.: (dinos+dynos+dèinos) con anse ad anello (ringed-handle (dinos+dynos+dèinos)), and synonyms, 
generally extracted from the UF field, i.e. kylix a labbro risparmiato (spared-lip kylix), which stands 
for lip cup or cratere (crater)which stands for vaso (vase).

Besides, our additional resource has been created extracting terms from existing literature. Also, 
from ICCD unstructured data (i.e. the vocabulary of Coroplastics) Proper and Place Names have been 
retrieved, which are now entries of our dictionary. 

3.1 Formal, syntactic and semantic features 

The main formal structures recorded in our electronic dictionary are: 

 Noun+Preposition+Noun+Preposition+Noun (NPNPN), i.e. fibula ad arco a coste (ribbed-
arch fibula); 

 Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective (NPNA), i.e. anello a capi ritorti (twisted-heads ring); 

 Noun+Preposition+Noun+Adjective+Adjective (NPNAA), i.e. punta a foglia larga ovale 
(oval broadleaf point). 

We also notice the presence of open series compounds. Open series compounds are multi-words in 
which we can identify one or more fixed elements co-occurring with one or more variable ones, i.e. 
palmetta a (cinque+sei+sette+DNUM) petali (little plam with (five+six+seven+DNUM) petals). 

As for semantics, we observe the presence of compounds in which the head does not occur in the 
first position; for instance, the open series frammenti di (terracotta+anfora+laterizi+N) (fragments of 
(clay+anphora+bricks+N)), places the heads at the end of the compounds, being frammenti 

(fragments) used to explicit the notion “N0 is a part of N1”. 
As far as syntactic aspects are concerned, some open series compounds, especially referred to 

coroplastic description, are sentence reductions5 in which it is used a present participle construction. 
For instance statua raffigurante Sileno (Silenus statue) is a reduction of the sentence: 
 
       Questa statua raffigura Sileno (This statue represents Silenus) 
[relative]  → Questa è una statua che raffigura Sileno (This is a statue which represents Silenus) 

[pr. part.]  → Questa è una statua raffigurante Sileno (This is a statue representing Silenus). 
 

In compounds containing present participle forms, semantic features can be identified using local 
grammars built on specific verb classes (semantic predicate sets); in such cases, co-occurrence 
restrictions can be described in terms of lexical forms and syntactic structures.

5Here the notation “sentence reduction” is to be intended in Z. S. Harris' sense.

4 Ontology-Based Electronic Dictionary 

An ontology-based electronic dictionary is likely to incorporate more information than thesauri. This 

comes from the fact that with reference to a thesaurus, an ontology also stores language-independent 
information and semantic relations. Therefore, the use of ontology in the upgrading of LG electronic 
dictionaries may ensure knowledge sharing, maintenance of semantic constraints, semantic 
ambiguities solving, and inferencing on the basis of ontology concept networks. 

As far as our ontology schema is concerned, we refer to ICOM International Committee for 
Documentation (CIDOC) Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), an ISO standard since 2006, 
compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It provides definitions and a formal 

structure for describing the implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in Cultural Heritage 
documentation. 

In our dictionary, for each entry we indicate: 

 its POS (Category), internal structure and inflectional code6 (FLX); 

 its variants (VAR) and synonyms (SYN), if any; 

 the type of link (LINK) (RDF and/or HTML); 

 with reference to our taxonomy, the pertaining knowledge domain7 (DOM); 

 the CIDOC CRM Class (CCL).

5 Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) Integration 

The LLOD is a project developed by the Open Linguistics Working Group (OLWG). It aims to create 
a representation formalism for corpora in Resource Description Framework/Web Ontology Language 
(RDF/OWL). The initiative intends to link LRs, represented in RDF, with the resources available in 
the Linked Open Data (LOD)8 cloud. The LLOD goal is not only to provide LRs in an interoperable 

way, but also to use an open license and link LRs with other resources in order to combine information 
from different knowledge sources. According to the LOD paradigm (Berners-Lee, 2006), Web 
resources have to present a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for entities to which they refer to, and 
to include links to other resources. According to Chiarcos et al. (2013a), “linking to central 
terminology repositories facilitates conceptual interoperability”. 

Benefits of LLOD are also identified in linking through URIs, federation, dynamic linking between 
resources (Chiarcos et al., 2013b). 

Besides, data structured in RDF format can be queried by means of the SPARQL language. Indeed, 
if RDF triples represent a set of relationship among resources, than SPARQL queries are the patterns 
for these relationships. 

One of the most relevant LLOD resources are stored in and presented by DBpedia 
(www.dbpedia.org). DBPedia is a sample of large Linked Datasets, which offers Wikipedia 
information in RDF format and incorporate other Web datasets. 

Therefore, we have referred and will refer to DBPedia Italian9 datasets to integrate our LRs with 
LLOD. DBPedia Italian is an open project developed and maintained by the Web of Data10 research 

unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler11. 

                                                           
6All inflectional codes are built by means of local grammars in the form of Finite State Automata/Transducers. 

7The taxonomy we use is structured on the basis of the indications given by the ICCD guidelines. Therefore, the tags 
RA1SUORC stands for Archaeological Remains/Tools/Receptacles and Containers.

According to Linked Data prescriptions, URI schema is structured as 
 

http://it.dbpedia.org/resource/ordine_dorico Resource URI 
http://it.dbpedia.org/page/ordine_dorico HTML representation 
http://it.dbpedia.org/data/ordine_dorico.{ rdf | n3 | json | ntriples } Machine-readable resource representation 

Table 3. Sample of URI schema for the resource ordine dorico (doric order). 

 
In order to reuse such prescriptions, we adopt a Finite State Transducer-based system which merge  

specific matching URIs with electronic dictionary entries. 
 

 
Figure 2. An example of Finite State Transducer for LLOD integration. 

 
When we apply the transducer to dictionary entries tagged with “LINK=RDF”, NooJ12 generates a 

new string in which the resource URI is placed before the original entry. In this way, the transducer 
enriches all entries of our electronic dictionary with DBPedia resources. For instance, the result given 
by the transducer for the compound Ordine dorico is the following string: 

 

 

Resulting strings may be used to automatically read text by means of Web browsers and/or RDF 
environments/routines. When the generated string is processed by a Web Browser, it will generate a 
link to the HTML representation. Otherwise, when the header “HTTP Accept:” of the query is 
produced by a RDF-based application, it will produce a link to the machine-readable representation. 

6 Future work 

Our future goal is to develop an application useful for both retrieve and process RDF data from LLOD 
resources. We intend to implement an environment structured into two workflows: the first one (based 
on SPARQL language) to query online repositories and create a system of Question-Answering, the 
second one to retrieve natural language strings, in particular those contained in the fields “rdfs: 
comment” and “dbpedia-owl: abstract”. Such data will constitute the basis for the development of a 
supervised machine-learning algorithm that, through the matching with existing dictionaries and 
grammars local, will further upgrade the LRs.
