Abstract 

The study of the relationships between speech and gesture promises a lot of insights into 

speech production and comprehension processes.  In this work we explore syntactic and 

semantic characteristics of verbal correlates of speech-accompanying gestures. The results of 

the corpora studies show, that we can reveal the statistical probability for certain types of 

gestures to appear in given context. For example, semantic correlates of deictic gestures are 

mostly noun phrases, and only in few cases these gestures correspond to adverbs, although 

they may coincide with any part of a clause. Single beats differ from other gesture types in 

their tendency to accompany speech disfluencies, discourse markers, and unimportant parts 

of a clause. Looking from the perspective if the meaning of words, accompanied by gestures, 

we can see, that new or re-activated referents might be presented with deictic gestures, 

uncertainty or direct speech are a domain of beat gestures.  

1 Introduction  

Gesticulation or speech-accompanying gestures perform the same functions, serve the same goals and 

relate to the same information as do the words, as showed in (McNeill, 1992). At the same time the 

interplay of speech and gesticulation, especially distribution of pragmatic, semantic and referential 

meanings still stays unclear. Maha Salem and her colleagues point out that synchronization of 

different modalities for conversational agents or robotic platforms “is either achieved only 

approximately or by solely adapting one modality to the other, e.g. by adjusting gesture speed to the 

timing of running speech” (Salem et al. 2011). Our work is aimed to describe statistical probability for 

different types of gestures to appear in certain verbal contexts. These contexts were described 

depending on their morphological and syntactical characteristics, as shown in part  3.1. To achieve this 

goal we created two 20-minutes corpora consisting of TV talk-show fragments and retellings of “The 

pear stories” (Chafe, 1980).  

2 Data analysis 

2.1 Corpus description 

We formed two different corpora to compare gesture properties in different types of discourse, namely 

dialogue and narration. The first one included seven fragments of TV interviews and panel discussion 

of some common social issues and was supposed to include various types and styles of conversation. 

The aim of this corpus was to register as many examples of gestures with diverse functions in different 

contexts, as possible. The second corpus consisted of eight retelling of “The pear stories” made by 

university students with very little or no interventions by a listener, thus it was more homogeneous 

from the viewpoint of genre, topic and discourse structure, so it allowed comparing gesture features, 

concerning global discourse structure. The results show, that most gesture functions are common for 

different genres.

2.2 Transcribing and coding 

2.2.1 Gesture types 

Coding concentrated on movements of the hands. Gestures were divided into five groups, using 

modified D. McNeill’s classification (1992). Besides deictics, we distinguish descriptive, meta-

discursive, beat and rhythmic gestures. Considering the fact that distinctions between iconic and 

metaphoric gestures are not always obvious (see e.g. Gullberg, 1995), we reviewed these classes as 

descriptive and meta-discursive, relying on the form of the gesture and its relation to speech. Meta-

discursive gestures treat simultaneous words as if from the outside, regarding speech as an object that 

can be transferred to an addressee, or manipulated in a different way (e.g. a whole that can be divided 

into parts, or a process that can be accelerated or slowed down). Descriptive gestures concern to the 

storyline and reflect the content of the illustrated words. Also we distinguish single beats and rhythmic 

gestures (named in Ekman, Friesen, 1969). So, the main ground for this classification was the form of 

the gesture, also taking into account its meaning and relation to the corresponding words. The future 

analysis proved the validity of this division.  

2.2.2 Characteristics of speech segments accompanied by gestures 

We examined the following types of gesture correlates:  

1. full clauses, which can describe the line of the story or else can be 

a. meta-discursive (We are talking about…); 

b. citations (He asked: “How do you do it?”); 

c. repetition of the previous clause; 

d. reformulation or elaboration of the previous clause; 

e. false-start. 

2. noun phrases, divided into groups relying on their accessibility and syntactical role; 

3. adverbs, considering their semantics; 

4. verbs and verbal phrases, taking into account their syntactical form and meaning 

5. discourse markers, also divided into groups, following Schiffrin (1987). 

We labeled all the items in the corpora according to this list and compared the probability to be 

accompanied of every type of gesture (or to appear without any gesture). For referential gestures we 

counted the speech segments with the same meaning, for beats and rhythmics only the temporal 

correspondence was possible. 

3 Results 

The first corpus contains 545 gestures, the second one – 338 gestures. It seems worth to mention, that 

proportions of gesture types were similar to those in D. McNeill’s study (1992), taking into account 

the difference in classification (Table 1).

Analysis of the data in Tables 1-3 is presented below.  

3.1 Deictic gestures correlates 

Deictic gestures illustrate noun phrases (87%) and adverbs of time and place (13%), although they 

may appear in any part of a clause. There was even an example, where the gesture was used without an 

explicit verbal correlate (1) (the underlined words are accompanied by the gesture). 

 

(1) Go! 

(right palm facing the center, fingers extended toward the listener) 

 

When used with adverbs, deictics can reveal standard metaphors, such as past is behind us 

(Lakoff, Johnson, 1980), or appeal to common knowledge in the context of discourse, see (1). 

 

(2) Like now and here. 

(right palm up, fingers towards the listener slightly curved) 

 

Deictic gestures often mark the clauses of meta-discursive level, when the speaker points at himself 

or at a listener, and also these gestures accompany citations, placing a referent in the space near the 

speaker or illustrating adverbs. 

3.2 Descriptive gestures correlates 

These gestures tend to illustrate verbs and less often can be seen with noun phrases, comparing to 

other gesture types. Only descriptive gestures, that have complex form and can carry much 

information additional to words, were met with interjections. 

When used with clauses, these gestures tend to appear with reformulations, what can be explained 

as a speaker’s intention to elaborate and to force her/his idea, so that visual illustration is needed, 

whether in order to resolve verbalization problems, the speaker’s rhetoric aim or listener’s demand 

(when the last does not completely understand the message).

3.3 Meta-discursive gestures correlates 

The most often example of this gesture type is palm up opened hand (Müller, 2004). The semantics of 

the gesture reveals conduit metaphor (Lakoff, Johnson, 1980), when a speaker passes his words or 

ideas to a listener. 

Meta-discursive gestures more often refer not to a single word, but to a phrase or a part of a 

discourse. Their form is less connected to the meaning of accompanied words, than it is with two 

previous types. They are used to emphasize related words and often coincide with prosodic 

accentuation.  

Meta-discursive gestures tend to appear with more static parts oа a clause, like noun phrases and 

discourse markers, and less often are met with verbal phrases and adverbs. It can be explained in 

connection with the meaning of the conduit metaphor, which interprets the words said by a speaker 

like a material object passed to a listener. Nouns are less easier to be seen as objects than verbs. So, 

NPs with meta-discursive gestures serve as topics or themes in the segment of a discourse. When they 

emphasize a whole clause, these gestures underline important links in the logic chain composed by the 

speaker; usually these statements contain causes, consequences, or concessions, crucial for 

understanding of the described facts. 

Obviously, these gestures are often used with meta-discursive clauses, describing, for example, the 

structure of a narration or intentions of a speaker. Also they tend to accompany literal repetitions of a 

previous clause. This shows that meta-discursive gestures are also a rhetoric instrument, used with less 

graphic predicates, than descriptive gestures, and with less thought-out statements, than rhythmics.  

3.4 Beat and rhythmic gestures correlates 

Short simple movements, usually up and down, can have only single words as their correlates, not 

phrases or clauses. They are twice more often met with discourse markers, speech disfluencies, and 

conjunctions, than other gestures. Also they tend to mark citations and repetitions. We suggest the 

hypothesis that beats are oriented at a speaker and their use is motivated by cognitive tasks resolved by 

a speaker. Another hypothesis of high beats frequency during the least interesting parts of a discourse 

can be that they serve as pause-fillers, showing the listener, that the speech is not finished yet. 

Rhythmic gestures label each syllable of a word or each word in a phrase and often cover the whole 

clause. They are never met with discourse markers, pauses, or false starts, so we can suppose, that 

these gestures tend to mark well-planned parts of a discourse and serve as conscious rhetoric 

instrument. They tend to accompany citations, which are important in the discourse or emphasized by 

a speaker. 

4 Conclusion 

Deictic gestures may appear in any part of a clause, even without explicit verbal correlate, but 

semantically they correspond to an adverb of time or place or to a noun phrase. Another tendency for 

these gestures is to illustrate meta-discursive sentences, describing the actual situation of 

communication. 

Descriptive gestures can be met with verbs and verbal phrases more often, than other types, and 

they are usually used with the reformulations and other important part of the discourse, contributing to 

the story-line. They avoid noun phrases and especially discourse markers. 

Meta-discursive gestures apparently are used with meta-discursive clauses. Yet they tend to 

illustrate unfinished clauses, noun phrases or discourse markers. They are not usual with verb phrases, 

citations and reformulations. 

Beats are remarkable for their tendency to appear with citations and repetitions, and especially 

speech disfluencies and discourse markers.

Rhythmic gestures usually accentuate long segments of discourse, at least a clause, and they can 

be used to underline citations, which the speaker considers to be important in his speech.
