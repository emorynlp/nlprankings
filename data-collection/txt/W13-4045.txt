Abstract

This study explores laughter distribution
around topic changes in multiparty conver-
sations. The distribution of shared and solo
laughter around topic changes was examined
in corpora containing two types of spoken in-
teraction; meetings and informal conversation.
Shared laughter was significantly more fre-
quent in the 15 seconds leading up to topic
change in the informal conversations. A sam-
ple of informal conversations was then anal-
ysed by hand to gain further insight into links
between laughter and topic change.

1 Introduction

Human spoken interaction comprises a bundle of
signals and cues, together and separately providing
information relevant to the topic or task at hand, and
serving to build or maintain social bonds. Dialogue
is multifunctional, serving social as well as informa-
tion transfer goals. Laughter is predominantly social
rather than a solo activity, is universally present in
humans, part of the ‘universal human vocabulary’,
innate, instinctual, and inherited from primate an-
cestors (Provine, 2004; Glenn, 2003). In conversa-
tion, it predominantly punctuates rather than inter-
rupts speech. Accounts of laughter’s role range from
response to humour to a social cohesion or bonding
mechanism used since our primate days. It has been
suggested that laughter is often a co-operative mech-
anism which can provide clues to dialogue structure
(Holt, 2011). Herein, we investigate the relevance of
laughter to topic change by analysing two corpora of
conversational speech in terms of temporal distribu-
tion of laughter, first through statistical analysis of

laughter and topic change distribution, then by man-
ual study of an hour of spontaneous conversation.

2 Laughter and Topic Change

Conversation analysis has highlighted connections
between laughter and topic change; many conver-
sations in the Holt corpus of mostly two person tele-
phone dialogues include laughter at topic closings
(Holt, 2010). Laughter has been linked to topic
closure in situations where one participant produces
jokes or laughs, thus inviting others to join in, with
this invitation open to refusal if interlocutors con-
tinue speaking on the topic at hand (Jefferson, 1979).
Holt (2010) suggests that laughter may arise at topic
changes because turns consisting only of laughter
are backwards looking, not adding to the last topic,
and thus constituting a signal that the current topic
has been exhausted and that the conversation is at
a topic change relevant point. We hypothesise that
these laughter turns form a ‘buffer’ allowing partic-
ipants a reassuring moment of social bonding. In
a meeting, there is a set agenda, a chairperson, and
protocols for moving from topic to topic. In social
dialogue, the goal is to pass time together, and top-
ics are not lined up ready for use. Aversion to poten-
tially embarrassing silence may be more pertinent in
informal conversation; thus laughter preceding topic
change may be more likely in informal dialogue.

Although there is much mention of laughter in
conversation analysis, it is difficult to find quanti-
tative data on its distribution in spoken interaction.
Previous work (Bonin et al., 2012b) established that
laughter, particularly shared laughter, is less likely
to occur in the first quarter of a topic than in the fi-
nal quarter, and that this distinction is greater in so-

304



cial conversation. In this work we test the hypothe-
sis that laughter should be frequently found before
rather than simply around topic changes. We ex-
amine the frequency of laughter within a range of
distances from either side of a topic change, to in-
vestigate if there is a period of higher laughter fre-
quency independent of topic length. We are also
interested in exploring whether the turns leading
to topic change follow the observations on topic
change sequences and laughter distribution in two
party conversations in the literature. If there are
identifiable sequences involving laughter leading to
topic change, knowledge of their architecture will
aid in creating algorithms for discourse recognition
and segmentation in multiparty conversation.

The notion of topic in discourse has been stud-
ied extensively but a concise definition is diffi-
cult to find. Topic has been described at sen-
tence level (Lambrecht, 1996), at discourse level
(Van Dijk, 1981); as a manifestation of speakers in-
tentions (Passonneau and Litman, 1997), and as co-
herent segments of discourse about the same thing
(Van Dijk, 1996). Here, we consider topic at dis-
course level as a chunk of coherent content.

3 Corpora

We analysed two datasets to cover free natural inter-
action and more structured meetings.

3.1 Topic annotation in TableTalk and AMI
Both TableTalk and AMI have topic annotations
freely available. TableTalk topics were annotated
manually by two labellers at a single level; AMI
annotations include top-level or core topics whose
content reflects the main meeting structure, and
subtopics for small digressions inside the core top-
ics. Here we use the core topic segmentation which
is more in line with the TableTalk annotation.

3.2 TableTalk
The TableTalk corpus contains multimodal record-
ings of free flowing natural conversations among
five participants, recorded at the Advanced Telecom-
munication Research Labs in Japan (Campbell,
2009). In order to collect as natural data as possi-
ble, neither topics of discussion nor activities were
restricted in advance. Three sessions were recorded
over three consecutive days in an informal setting

over coffee, by three female (Australian, Finnish,
and Japanese) and two male (Belgian and British)
participants (Jokinen, 2009). The conversations are
fully transcribed and segmented for topic, and also
annotated for affective state of participants and for
gesture and postural communicative functions us-
ing MUMIN (Allwood et al., 2007). Table-talk has
been analyzed in terms of engagement and laugh-
ter (Bonin et al., 2012a) and lexical accommodation
(Vogel and Behan, 2012). Our analyses used tran-
scripts of the entire corpus: about 3h 30, 31523 to-
kens and 5980 turns. Laughter was transcribed in
intervals on the speech transcription tier as @w, (un-
less inserted as part of a longer utterance). The total
number of laughs is 713. Shared laughter was auto-
matically annotated as described in §4.

3.3 AMI

The AMI (Augmented Multi-party Interaction)
Meeting Corpus is a multimodal data set of 100
hours of meeting recordings (McCowan et al.,
2005). The corpus contains real and scenario-driven
meetings. We base our analysis on the scenario
based meetings, with a total of 717,239 tokens. Each
meeting has four participants, and the same subjects
meet over four different sessions to discuss a design
project. The sessions correspond to four different
project steps (Project kick-off meeting, Functional
Design, Conceptual Design and Detailed Design).
Each participant is given a role to play (project
manager, marketing expert, industrial designer and
user interface designer) and keeps this role until the
end of the scenario. Conversations are all in En-
glish, with 91 native speakers and 96 non-native
speakers participating. There are 11,277 instances
of laughter, annotated in the transcripts as vocal-
sounds/laugh. About 25% of these laughs are anno-
tated with start time only.

4 Analytical methodologies

4.1 Automated and manual analyses

Both corpora were also analysed automatically, and
a one-hour sample of the TableTalk corpus was anal-
ysed on a case-by-case basis to investigate if laugh-
ter around topic change did indeed follow the pat-
terns proposed in the literature.

For the initial stages of ongoing manual analysis

305



to gain more insight into the mechanisms underly-
ing laughter and topic change, a one-hour stretch of
conversation from the second day of the TableTalk
was selected for study. The mechanism outlined
by Holt, based on Jefferson’s work on laughter and
Schegloff’s topic final sequences (Schegloff, 2007),
hinges on whether a laughter invitation is taken up
an interlocutor in two party dialogue. If it is, then
one or more laughter turns ensue and the likelihood
of topic change is high. The opposite occurs when
the interlocutor does not take up the invitation but
rather continues with further talk on the topic, avert-
ing topic change. We were interested in observing if
this phenomenon occurred in multiparty conversa-
tion, and if subsequent topic change was dependent
on how many of the group took up the invitation to
laugh. As analysis of the two corpora showed higher
likelihood of laughter before topic change in more
informal conversation, we chose to examine a sam-
ple of TableTalk for preliminary study.

This sample contained 1834 utterances, 36 T-
event or topic change instants, and 329 laughs
among the five participants, of which 76 were solo
while the remainder contributed to a total of 68
shared laugh events, all of which were manually an-
notated on separate laughter tiers. For each instance
of laughter, we also annotated the number of partic-
ipants who laughed and the distance from the laugh-
ter to the next topic commencement.

4.2 Temporal definitions and measurement

We use an algorithm resulting from earlier work to
annotate shared and solo laughter. The algorithm
was motivated by the observation that in both cor-
pora laughter was sometimes annotated with start
time only, and also that laughter in response to the
same stimulus should be considered shared laugh-
ter. These two factors taken together allow us to
recover shared laughter that may be missed if we
simply count overlapping laughs of distinct speak-
ers. The algorithm defines shared laughter as: (a)
overlapping laughs of distinct speakers; or (b) con-
secutive laughs of distinct speakers within distance
✏. We calculate ✏ using the probability distribution
that successive laughs with observation of start time
only are part of a shared laugh event, trained on a
subset of overlapping laughs from the corpora.

Topic changes (T-events) are the annotated time

points where topic shifts in conversation. We
counted the frequency of laughter, shared laughter,
and solo laughter into 5-second bins at T-event mi-
nus multiples of 5 seconds (T-5, T-10, T-15, T-20) in
order to look at the laughter trend near topic termi-
nation. A meaningful threshold emerges (T-15 sec-
onds) where a change in the laughter trend is vis-
ible. Hence we counted the frequency of laughter
between T-15 and T, and T and T+15.

5 Results

5.1 Automated processing

We counted the frequency of laughter, shared laugh-
ter, and solo laughter in 5-second bins at T- event
time T minus multiples of 5 seconds (T-5, T-10,
T-15, T-20). Fig. 1 shows the mean frequency of
laughs per bin in TableTalk. While in AMI the distri-
bution over the bins does not show significant trends,
in TableTalk, we noticed a significant change at T-
15.1 Hence we take T-15 as a rational threshold
marking some change in the laughter distribution be-
fore a topic boundary in informal chat.

Then we analyzed the frequency of laughter be-
tween T-15 and T (we call this segment wt) and
T+15 (wb). As shown in Fig. 2, we notice a signifi-
cant difference in the amount of both shared and solo
laughter between topic terminations (wt) and topic
beginnings (wb). In particular topic terminations
show a higher frequency of laughter than topic be-
ginnings. The result holds in AMI and in TableTalk.

5.2 Manual processing

The first observation from the manual analysis is
that the shared/solo laugh ratio is heavily skewed to-
wards shared laughter (253 laughs were shared vs 79
solo). Laughs were combined into laugh events ac-
cording to the number of participants involved. The
length of laugh events was significantly shorter for
one-person laugh events than for shared laughter, see
Fig. 3. Distance to next topic change and number of

1The laughter counts in the bins for each of T-5, T-10 and T-
15 are significantly greater than random samples of 5 sec. con-
versation slices (Wilcox directed test, p < 0.002); the counts
for T-20 are not significantly greater than random slices. Fur-
ther, the counts for T-20 are significantly less than those in each
of T-15 (p < 0.02), T-10 (p < 0.02) and T-5 (p < 0.005), while
the pairwise differences among T-15, T-10 and T-5 are not sign-
ficant. We conclude that T-15 contains an inflection point.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

Our results indicate a likelihood of shared laugher
appearing in the final 15 seconds before a new topic
commences. This is in line with the literature which
reports laughter at topic transition relevant places,
and thus before a topic change. We have also seen
that the number of people sharing laughter is re-
lated to reducing distance from the laughter to the
next topic change, and that laugh events are longer

as more participants join in. Models of a complex-
ity adequate to predict human behaviour require ex-
haustively detailed analysis of stretches of conver-
sation in addition to broad statistical analysis. Our
combination of approaches has proven fruitful. Sev-
eral observations from the preliminary close exami-
nation of the TableTalk data provide fruit for further
research. Many of the short solo laughs may be seen
as responses to one’s own or another participant’s
content, while stronger solo laughs may tend to in-
vite longer and stronger laughter from others, lead-
ing to topic change possibilities. An acoustic anal-
ysis of the laughter will investigate this. We also
observed that shared laughter among several partic-
ipants which did not result in topic change were fre-
quently interpretable as attempts to draw an ongo-
ing topic to a close. This merits investigation to
see whether these laugh events can be considered
topic transition relevant places. Analysis of speaker
changes and turn retrieval in and around these laugh-
ter events is underway to model these events.
