Abstract

This paper presents a simple, robust and
(almost) unsupervised dictionary-based
method, qwn-ppv (Q-WordNet as Person-
alized PageRanking Vector) to automati-
cally generate polarity lexicons. We show
that qwn-ppv outperforms other automat-
ically generated lexicons for the four ex-
trinsic evaluations presented here. It also
shows very competitive and robust results
with respect to manually annotated ones.
Results suggest that no single lexicon is
best for every task and dataset and that
the intrinsic evaluation of polarity lexicons
is not a good performance indicator on
a Sentiment Analysis task. The qwn-ppv
method allows to easily create quality po-
larity lexicons whenever no domain-based
annotated corpora are available for a given
language.

1 Introduction

Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis are im-
portant for determining opinions about commer-
cial products, on companies reputation manage-
ment, brand monitoring, or to track attitudes by
mining social media, etc. Given the explosion of
information produced and shared via the Internet,
it is not possible to keep up with the constant flow
of new information by manual methods.

Sentiment Analysis often relies on the availabil-
ity of words and phrases annotated according to
the positive or negative connotations they convey.
‘Beautiful’, ‘wonderful’, and ‘amazing’ are exam-
ples of positive words whereas ‘bad’, ‘awful’, and
‘poor’ are examples of negatives.

The creation of lists of sentiment words has
generally been performed by means of manual-,
dictionary- and corpus-based methods. Manually
collecting such lists of polarity annotated words is

labor intensive and time consuming, and is thus
usually combined with automated approaches as
the final check to correct mistakes. However,
there are well known lexicons which have been
fully (Stone et al., 1966; Taboada et al., 2010) or
at least partially manually created (Hu and Liu,
2004; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).

Dictionary-based methods rely on some dictio-
nary or lexical knowledge base (LKB) such as
WordNet (Fellbaum and Miller, 1998) that con-
tain synonyms and antonyms for each word. A
simple technique in this approach is to start with
some sentiment words as seeds which are then
used to perform some iterative propagation on the
LKB (Hu and Liu, 2004; Strapparava and Vali-
tutti, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al.,
2005; Turney and Littman, 2003; Mohammad et
al., 2009; Agerri and Garcı́a-Serrano, 2010; Bac-
cianella et al., 2010).

Corpus-based methods have usually been ap-
plied to obtain domain-specific polarity lexicons:
they have been created by either starting from a
seed list of known words and trying to find other
related words in a corpus or by attempting to di-
rectly adapt a given lexicon to a new one using
a domain-specific corpus (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Ding
et al., 2008; Choi and Cardie, 2009; Mihalcea et
al., 2007). One particular issue arising from cor-
pus methods is that for a given domain the same
word can be positive in one context but negative
in another. This is also a problem shared by man-
ual and dictionary-based methods, and that is why
qwn-ppv also produces synset-based lexicons for
approaches on Sentiment Analysis at sense level.

This paper presents a simple, robust and
(almost) unsupervised dictionary-based method,
QWordNet-PPV (QWordNet by Personalized
PageRank Vector) to automatically generate
polarity lexicons based on propagating some
automatically created seeds using a Personalized

88



PageRank algorithm (Agirre et al., 2014; Agirre
and Soroa, 2009) over a LKB projected into a
graph. We see qwn-ppv as an effective method-
ology to easily create polarity lexicons for any
language for which a WordNet is available.

This paper empirically shows that: (i) qwn-ppv
outperforms other automatically generated lexi-
cons (e.g. SentiWordNet 3.0, MSOL) on the 4
extrinsic evaluations presented here; it also dis-
plays competitive and robust results also with re-
spect to manually annotated lexicons; (ii) no single
polarity lexicon is fit for every Sentiment Analy-
sis task; depending on the text data and the task
itself, one lexicon will perform better than oth-
ers; (iii) if required, qwn-ppv efficently generates
many lexicons on demand, depending on the task
on which they will be used; (iv) intrinsic evalua-
tion is not appropriate to judge whether a polar-
ity lexicon is fit for a given Sentiment Analysis
(SA) task because good correlation with respect to
a gold-standard does not correspond with correla-
tion with respect to a SA task; (v) it is easily ap-
plicable to create qwn-ppv(s) for other languages,
and we demonstrate it here by creating many po-
larity lexicons not only for English but also for
Spanish; (vi) the method works at both word and
sense levels and it only requires the availability
of a LKB or dictionary; finally, (vii) a dictionary-
based method like qwn-ppv allows to easily cre-
ate quality polarity lexicons whenever no domain-
based annotated reviews are available for a given
language. After all, there usually is available a
dictionary for a given language; for example, the
Open Multilingual WordNet site lists WordNets
for up to 57 languages (Bond and Foster, 2013).

Although there has been previous work using
graph methods for obtaining lexicons via propa-
gation, the qwn-ppv method to combine the seed
generation and the Personalized PageRank prop-
agation is novel. Furthermore, it is considerable
simpler and obtains better and easier to reproduce
results than previous automatic approaches (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2007; Mohammad et al., 2009;
Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).

Next section reviews previous related work, tak-
ing special interest on those that are currently
available for evaluation purposes. Section 3 de-
scribes the qwn-ppv method to automatically gen-
erate lexicons. The resulting lexical resources are
evaluated in section 4. We finish with some con-
cluding remarks and future work in section 5.

2 Related Work

There is a large amount of work on Sentiment
Analysis and Opinion Mining, and good com-
prehensive overviews are already available (Pang
and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012), so we will review
the most representative and closest to the present
work. This means that we will not be review-
ing corpus-based approaches but rather those con-
structed manually or upon a dictionary or LKB.
We will in turn use the approaches here reviewed
for comparison with qwn-ppv in section 4.

The most popular manually-built polarity lexi-
con is part of the General Inquirer (Stone et al.,
1966), and consists of 1915 words labelled as
“positive” and 2291 as “negative”. Taboada et al.
(2010) manually created their lexicons annotating
the polarity of 6232 words on a scale of 5 to -5.
Liu et al., starting with Hu and Liu (2004), have
along the years collected a manually corrected po-
larity lexicon which is formed by 4818 negative
and 2041 positive words. Another manually cor-
rected lexicon (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) is the one
used by the Opinion Finder system (Wilson et al.,
2005) and contains 4903 negatively and 2718 pos-
itively annotated words respectively.

Among the automatically built lexicons, Turney
and Littman (2003) proposed a minimally super-
vised algorithm to calculate the polarity of a word
depending on whether it co-ocurred more with a
previously collected small set of positive words
rather than with a set of negative ones. Agerri and
Garcı́a Serrano presented a very simple method
to extract the polarity information starting from
the quality synset in WordNet (Agerri and Garcı́a-
Serrano, 2010). Mohammad et al. (2009) de-
veloped a method in which they first identify (by
means of affixes rules) a set of positive/negative
words which act as seeds, then used a Roget-like
thesaurus to mark the synonymous words for each
polarity type and to generalize from the seeds.
They produce several lexicons the best of which,
MSOL(ASL and GI) contains 51K and 76K en-
tries respectively and uses the full General Inquirer
as seeds. They performed both intrinsic and ex-
trinsic evaluations using the MPQA 1.1 corpus.

Finally, there are two approaches that are some-
what closer to us, because they are based on Word-
Net and graph-based methods. SentiWordNet 3.0
(Baccianella et al., 2010) is built in 4 steps: (i)
they select the synsets of 14 paradigmatic pos-
itive and negative words used as seeds (Turney

89



and Littman, 2003). These seeds are then it-
eratively extended following the construction of
WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004).
(ii) They train 7 supervised classifiers with the
synsets’ glosses which are used to assign polar-
ity and objectivity scores to WordNet senses. (iii)
In SentiWordNet 3.0 (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007)
they take the output of the supervised classifiers
as input to applying PageRank to WordNet 3.0’s
graph. (iv) They intrinsically evaluate it with re-
spect to MicroWnOp-3.0 using the p-normalized
Kendall τ distance (Baccianella et al., 2010). Rao
and Ravichandran (2009) apply different semi-
supervised graph algorithms (Mincuts, Random-
ized Mincuts and Label Propagation) to a set of
seeds constructed from the General Inquirer. They
evaluate the generated lexicons intrinsically taking
the General Inquirer as the gold standard for those
words that had a match in the generated lexicons.

In this paper, we describe two methods to au-
tomatically generate seeds either by following
Agerri and Garcı́a-Serrano (2010) or using Tur-
ney and Littman’s (2003) seeds. The automati-
cally obtained seeds are then fed into a Person-
alized PageRank algorithm which is applied over
a WordNet projected on a graph. This method is
fully automatic, simple and unsupervised as it only
relies on the availability of a LKB.

3 Generating qwn-ppv

The overall procedure of our approach consists of
two steps: (1) automatically creates a set of seeds
by iterating over a LKB (e.g. a WordNet) rela-
tions; and (2) uses the seeds to initialize contexts
to propagate over the LKB graph using a Personal-
ized Pagerank algorithm. The result is qwn-ppv(s):
Q-WordNets as Personalized PageRanking Vec-
tors.

3.1 Seed Generation

We generate seeds by means of two different auto-
matic procedures.

1. AG: We start at the quality synset of WordNet
and iterate over WordNet relations following
the original Q-WordNet method described in
Agerri and Garcı́a Serrano (2010).

2. TL: We take a short manually created list
of 14 positive and negative words (Turney
and Littman, 2003) and iterate over Word-
Net using five relations: antonymy, similarity,

derived-from, pertains-to and also-see.

The AG method starts the propagation from
the attributes of the quality synset in WordNet.
There are five noun quality senses in WordNet,
two of which contain attribute relations (to adjec-
tives). From the quality1n synset the attribute re-
lation takes us to positive1a, negative

1
a, good

1
a and

bad1a; quality
2
n leads to the attributes superior

1
a and

inferior2a. The following step is to iterate through
every WordNet relation collecting (i.e., annotat-
ing) those synsets that are accessible from the
seeds. Both AG and TL methods to generate seeds
rely on a number of relations to obtain a more bal-
anced POS distribution in the output synsets. The
output of both methods is a list of (assumed to be)
positive and negative synsets. Depending on the
number of iterations performed a different number
of seeds to feed UKB is obtained. Seed numbers
vary from 100 hundred to 10K synsets. Both seed
creation methods can be applied to any WordNet,
not only Princeton WordNet, as we show in sec-
tion 4.

3.2 PPV generation

The second and last step to generate qwn-ppv(s)
consists of propagating over a WordNet graph to
obtain a Personalized PageRanking Vector (PPV),
one for each polarity. This step requires:

1. A LKB projected over a graph.

2. A Personalized PageRanking algorithm
which is applied over the graph.

3. Seeds to create contexts to start the propaga-
tion, either words or synsets.

Several undirected graphs based on WordNet
3.0 as represented by the MCR 3.0 (Agirre et
al., 2012) have been created for the experimenta-
tion, which correspond to 4 main sets: (G1) two
graphs consisting of every synset linked by the
synonymy and antonymy relations; (G2) a graph
with the nodes linked by every relation, includ-
ing glosses; (G3) a graph consisting of the synsets
linked by every relation except those that are
linked by antonymy; finally, (G4) a graph consist-
ing of the nodes related by every relation except
the antonymy and gloss relations.

Using the (G1) graphs, we propagate from the
seeds over each type of graph (synonymy and
antonymy) to obtain two rankings per polarity.

The graphs created in (G2), (G3) and (G4) are
used to obtain two ranks, one for each polarity by
propagating from the seeds. In all four cases the
different polarity rankings have to be combined in
order to obtain a final polarity lexicon: the polar-
ity score pol(s) of a given synset s is computed
by adding its scores in the positive rankings and
subtracting its scores in the negative rankings. If
pol(s) > 0 then s is included in the final lexicon
as positive. If pol(s) < 0 then s is included in the
final lexicon as negative. We assume that synsets
with null polarity scores have no polarity and con-
sequently they are excluded from the final lexicon.

The Personalized PageRanking propagation is
performed starting from both synsets and words
and using both AG and TL styles of seed gen-
eration, as explained in section 3.1. Combin-
ing the various possibilities will produce at least
6 different lexicons for each iteration, depending
on which decisions are taken about which graph,
seeds and word/synset to create the qwn-ppv(s). In
fact, the experiments produced hundreds of lexi-
cons, according to the different iterations for seed
generation1, but we will only refer to those that
obtain the best results in the extrinsic evaluations.

With respect to the algorithm to propagate over
the WordNet graph from the automatically created
seeds, we use a Personalized PageRank algorithm
(Agirre et al., 2014; Agirre and Soroa, 2009). The
famous PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) algo-
rithm is a method to produce a rank from the ver-
tices in a graph according to their relative struc-
tural importance. PageRank has also been viewed
as the result of a Random Walk process, where the
final rank of a given node represents the probabil-
ity of a random walk over the graph which ends on
that same node. Thus, if we take the created Word-

1The total time to generate the final 352 QWN-PPV prop-
agations amounted to around two hours of processing time in
a standard PC.

Net graph G with N vertices v1, . . . , vn and di as
being the outdegree of node i, plus a N ×N tran-
sition probability matrix M where Mji = 1/di
if a link from i to j exists and 0 otherwise, then
calculating the PageRank vector over a graph G
amounts to solve the following equation (1):

Pr = cMPr + (1− c)v (1)
In the traditional PageRank, vector v is a uni-

form normalized vector whose elements values are
all 1/N , which means that all nodes in the graph
are assigned the same probabilities in case of a
random walk. Personalizing the PageRank algo-
rithm in this case means that it is possible to make
vector v non-uniform and assign stronger proba-
bilities to certain nodes, which would make the
algorithm to propagate the initial importance of
those nodes to their vicinity. Following Agirre et
al. (2014), in our approach this translates into ini-
tializing vector v with those senses obtained by the
seed generation methods described above in sec-
tion 3.1. Thus, the initialization of vector v us-
ing the seeds allows the Personalized propagation
to assign greater importance to those synsets in
the graph identified as being positive and negative,
which resuls in a PPV with the weigths skewed to-
wards those nodes initialized/personalized as pos-
itive and negative.

4 Evaluation

Previous approaches have provided intrinsic eval-
uation (Mohammad et al., 2009; Rao and
Ravichandran, 2009; Baccianella et al., 2010) us-
ing manually annotated resources such as the Gen-
eral Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966) as gold stan-
dard. To facilitate comparison, we also provide
such evaluation in section 4.3. Nevertheless, and
as demonstrated by the results of the extrinsic eval-
uations, we believe that polarity lexicons should

in general be evaluated extrinsically. After all,
any polarity lexicon is as good as the results ob-
tained by using it for a particular Sentiment Anal-
ysis task.

Our goal is to evaluate the polarity lexicons
simplifying the evaluation parameters to avoid as
many external influences as possible on the re-
sults. We compare our work with most of the
lexicons reviewed in section 2, both at synset
and word level, both manually and automatically
generated: General Inquirer (GI), Opinion Finder
(OF), Liu, Taboada et al.’s (SO-CAL), Agerri
and Garcı́a-Serrano (2010) (QWN), Mohammad
et al’s, (MSOL(ASL-GI)) and SentiWordNet 3.0
(SWN). The results presented in section 4.2 show
that extrinsic evaluation is more meaningful to de-
termine the adequacy of a polarity lexicon for a
specific Sentiment Analysis task.

4.1 Datasets and Evaluation System

Three different corpora were used: Bespalov et
al.’s (2011) and MPQA (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003)
for English, and HOpinion2 in Spanish. In addi-
tion, we divided the corpus into two subsets (75%
development and 25% test) for applying our ratio
system for the phrase polarity task too. Note that
the development set is only used to set up the po-
larity classification task, and that the generation of
qwn-ppv lexicons is unsupervised.

For Spanish we tried to reproduce the English
settings with Bespalov’s corpus. Thus, both devel-
opment and test sets were created from the HOpin-
ion corpus. As it contains a much higher propor-
tion of positive reviews, we created also subsets
which contain a balanced number of positive and
negative reviews to allow for a more meaningful
comparison than that of table 6. Table 3 shows the
number of documents per polarity for Bespalov’s,

Table 3: Number of positive and negative docu-

We report results of 4 extrinsic evaluations or
tasks, three of them based on a simple ratio av-
erage system, inspired by Turney (2002), and an-
other one based on Mohammad et al. (2009). We
first implemented a simple average ratio classifier
which computes the average ratio of the polarity
words found in document d:

polarity(d) =
∑

w∈d pol(w)
|d| (2)

where, for each polarity, pol(w) is 1 if w is in-
cluded in the polarity lexicon and 0 otherwise.
Documents that reach a certain threshold are clas-
sified as positive, and otherwise as negative. To
setup an evaluation enviroment as fair as possi-
ble for every lexicon, the threshold is optimised by
maximising accuracy over the development data.

Second, we implemented a phrase polarity task
identification as described by Mohammad et al.
(2009). Their method consists of: (i) if any of
the words in the target phrase is contained in the
negative lexicon, then the polarity is negative; (ii)
if none of the words are negative, and at least one
word is in the positive lexicon, then is positive;
(iii) the rest are not tagged.

We chose this very simple polarity estimators
because our aim was to minimize the role other

aspects play in the evaluation and focus on how,
other things being equal, polarity lexicons perform
in a Sentiment Analysis task. The average ratio
is used to present results of tables 1 and 2 (with
Bespalov corpus), and 5 and 6 (with HOpinion),
whereas Mohammad et al.’s is used to report re-
sults in table 4. Mohammad et al.’s (2009) testset
based on MPQA 1.1 is smaller, but both MPQA
1.1 and 1.2 are hugely skewed towards negative
polarity (30% positive vs. 70% negative).

All datasets were POS tagged and Word
Sense Disambiguated using FreeLing (Padró and
Stanilovsky, 2012; Agirre and Soroa, 2009). Hav-
ing word sense annotated datasets gives us the op-
portunity to evaluate the lexicons both at word and
sense levels. For the evaluation of those lexicons
that are synset-based, such as qwn-ppv and Sen-
tiWordNet 3.0, we convert them from senses to
words by taking every word or variant contained
in each of their senses. Moreover, if a lemma ap-
pears as a variant in several synsets the most fre-
quent polarity is assigned to that lemma.

With respect to lexicons at word level, we take
the most frequent sense according to WordNet 3.0
for each of their positive and negative words. Note
that the latter conversion, for synset based evalua-
tion, is mostly done to show that the evaluation at
synset level is harder independently of the quality
of the lexicon evaluated.

4.2 Results

Although tables 1, 2 and 4 also present re-
sults at synset level, it should be noted that the
only polarity lexicons available to us for com-
parison at synset level were Q-WordNet (Agerri
and Garcı́a-Serrano, 2010) and SentiWordNet 3.0
(Baccianella et al., 2010). QWN-PPV-AG refers
to the lexicon generated starting from AG’s seeds,
and QWN-PPV-TL using TL’s seeds as described

in section 3.1. Henceforth, we will use qwn-ppv to
refer to the overall method presented in this paper,
regardless of the seeds used.

For every qwn-ppv result reported in this sec-
tion, we have used every graph described in sec-
tion 3.2. The configuration of each qwn-ppv in the
results specifies which seed iteration is used as the
initialization of the Personalized PageRank algo-
rithm, and on which graph. Thus, QWN-PPV-TL
(s05 G4) in table 2 means that the 5th iteration of
synset seeds was used to propagate over graph G4.
If the configuration were (w05 G4) it would have
meant ‘the 5th iteration of word seeds were used
to propagate over graph G4’. The simplicity of
our approach allows us to generate many lexicons
simply by projecting a LKB over different graphs.

The lexicons marked with an asterisk denote
those that have been converted from word to
senses using the most frequent sense of WordNet
3.0. We would like to stress again that the purpose
of such word to synset conversion is to show that
SA tasks at synset level are harder than at word
level. In addition, it should also be noted that in
the case of SO-CAL (Taboada et al., 2010), we
have reduced what is a graded lexicon with scores
ranging from 5 to -5 into a binary one.

Table 1 shows that (at least partially) manually
built lexicons obtain the best results on this eval-
uation. It also shows that qwn-ppv clearly out-
performs any other automatically built lexicons.
Moreover, manually built lexicons suffer from the
evaluation at synset level, obtaining most of them
lower scores than qwn-ppv, although Liu’s (Hu
and Liu, 2004) still obtains the best results. In any
case, for an unsupervised procedure, qwn-ppv lex-
icons obtain very competitive results with respect
to manually created lexicons and is the best among
the automatic methods. It should also be noted that
the best results of qwn-ppv are obtained with graph

93



G1 and with very few seed iterations.

Table 2 again sees the manually built lexi-
cons performing better although overall the dif-
ferences are lower with respect to automatically
built lexicons. Among these, qwn-ppv again ob-
tains the best results, both at synset and word
level, although in the latter the differences with
MSOL(ASL-GI) are not large. Finally, table 4
shows that qwn-ppv again outperforms other auto-
matic approaches and is closer to those have been
(partially at least) manually built. In both MPQA
evaluations the best graph overall to propagate the
seeds is G3 because this type of task favours high
recall.

We report results on the Spanish HOpinion cor-
pus in tables 5 and 6. Mihalcea(f) is a manu-
ally revised lexicon based on the automatically
built Mihalcea(m) (Pérez-Rosas et al., 2012). Elh-
Polar (Saralegi and San Vicente, 2013) is semi-
automatically built and manually corrected. SO-
CAL is built manually. SWN and QWN-PPV have
been built via the MCR 3.0’s ILI by applying the
synset to word conversion previously described on
the Spanish dictionary of the MCR. The results for
Spanish at word level in table 6 show the same
trend as for English: qwn-ppv is the best of the
automatic approaches and it obtains competitive
although not as good as the best of the manually
created lexicons (ElhPolar). Due to the dispro-
portionate number of positive reviews, the results
for the negative polarity are not useful to draw any
meaningful conclusions. Thus, we also performed
an evaluation with HOpinion Balanced set as listed
in table 3.

The results with a balanced HOpinion, not
shown due to lack of space, also confirm the pre-
vious trend: qwn-ppv outperforms other automatic
approaches but is still worse than the best of the
manually created ones (ElhPolar).

4.3 Intrinsic evaluation

To facilitate intrinsic comparison with previous
approaches, we evaluate our automatically gener-
ated lexicons against GI. For each qwn-ppv lex-
icon shown in previous extrinsic evaluations, we
compute the intersection between the lexicon and
GI, and evaluate the words in that intersection. Ta-
ble 7 shows results for the best-performing QWN-
PPV lexicons (both using AG and TL seeds) in
the extrinsic evaluations at word level of tables 1
(first two rows), 2 (rows 3 and 4) and 4 (rows 5
and 6). We can see that QWN-PPV lexicons sys-
tematically outperform SWN in number of correct
entries. QWN-PPV-TL lexicons obtain 75.04%
of correctness on average. The best performing
lexicon contains up to 81.07% of correct entries.
Note that we did not compare the results with
MSOL(ASL-GI) because it contains the GI.

4.4 Discussion

QWN-PPV lexicons obtain the best results among
the evaluations for English and Spanish. Further-
more, across tasks and datasets qwn-ppv provides
a more consistent and robust behaviour than most
of the manually-built lexicons apart from OF. The
results also show that for a task requiring high

94



recall the larger graphs, e.g. G3, are preferable,
whereas for a more balanced dataset and document
level task smaller G1 graphs perform better.

These are good results considering that our
method to generate qwn-ppv is simpler, more ro-
bust and adaptable than previous automatic ap-
proaches. Furthermore, although also based on
a Personalized PageRank application, it is much
simpler than SentiWordNet 3.0, consistently out-
performed by qwn-ppv on every evaluation and
dataset. The main differences with respect to Sen-
tiWordNet’s approach are the following: (i) the
seed generation and training of 7 supervised clas-
sifiers corresponds in qwn-ppv to only one simple
step, namely, the automatic generation of seeds
as explained in section 3.1; (ii) the generation
of qwn-ppv only requires a LKB’s graph for the
Personalized PageRank propagation, no disam-
biguated glosses; (iii) the graph they use to do
the propagation also depends on disambiguated
glosses, not readily available for any language.

The fact that qwn-ppv is based on already
available WordNets projected onto simple graphs
is crucial for the robustness and adaptability of
the qwn-ppv method across evaluation tasks and
datasets: Our method can quickly create, over dif-
ferent graphs, many lexicons of diffent sizes which
can then be evaluated on a particular polarity clas-
sification task and dataset. Hence the different
configurations of the qwn-ppv lexicons, because
for some tasks a G3 graph with more AG/TL seed
iterations will obtain better recall and viceversa.
This is confirmed by the results: the tasks using
MPQA seem to clearly benefit from high recall
whereas the Bespalov’s corpus has overall, more
balanced scores. This could also be due to the size
of Bespalov’s corpus, almost 10 times larger than
MPQA 1.2.

The experiments to generate Spanish lexicons
confirm the trend showed by the English evalua-
tions: Lexicons generated by qwn-ppv consistenly
outperform other automatic approaches, although
some manual lexicon is better on a given task and
dataset (usually a different one). Nonetheless the
Spanish evaluation shows that our method is also
robust across languages as it gets quite close to
the manually corrected lexicon of Mihalcea(full)
(Pérez-Rosas et al., 2012).

The results also confirm that no single lexicon is
the most appropriate for any SA task or dataset and
domain. In this sense, the adaptability of qwn-ppv

is a desirable feature for lexicons to be employed
in SA tasks: the unsupervised qwn-ppv method
only relies on the availability of a LKB to build
hundreds of polarity lexicons which can then be
evaluated on a given task and dataset to choose the
best fit. If not annotated evaluation set is avail-
able, G3-based propagations provide the best re-
call whereas the G1-based lexicons are less noisy.
Finally, we believe that the results reported here
point out to the fact that intrinsic evaluations are
not meaningful to judge the adequacy a polarity
lexicon for a specific SA task.

5 Concluding Remarks

This paper presents an unsupervised dictionary-
based method qwn-ppv to automatically generate
polarity lexicons. Although simpler than similar
automatic approaches, it still obtains better results
on the four extrinsic evaluations presented. Be-
cause it only depends on the availability of a LKB,
we believe that this method can be valuable to gen-
erate on-demand polarity lexicons for a given lan-
guage when not sufficient annotated data is avail-
able. We demonstrate the adaptability of our ap-
proach by producing good performance polarity
lexicons for different evaluation scenarios and for
more than one language.

Further work includes investigating different
graph projections of WordNet relations to do the
propagation as well as exploiting synset weights.
We also plan to investigate the use of annotated
corpora to generate lexicons at word level to try
and close the gap with those that have been (at
least partially) manually annotated.

The qwn-ppv lexicons and graphs used in this
paper are publicly available (under CC-BY li-
cense): http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/qwn-ppv. The
qwn-ppv tool to automatically generate polarity
lexicons given a WordNet in any language will
soon be available in the aforementioned URL.
