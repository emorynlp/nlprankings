Abstract

In a spoken dialog system, dialog state
tracking deduces information about the
user’s goal as the dialog progresses, syn-
thesizing evidence such as dialog acts over
multiple turns with external data sources.
Recent approaches have been shown to
overcome ASR and SLU errors in some
applications. However, there are currently
no common testbeds or evaluation mea-
sures for this task, hampering progress.
The dialog state tracking challenge seeks
to address this by providing a heteroge-
neous corpus of 15K human-computer di-
alogs in a standard format, along with a
suite of 11 evaluation metrics. The chal-
lenge received a total of 27 entries from 9
research groups. The results show that the
suite of performance metrics cluster into 4
natural groups. Moreover, the dialog sys-
tems that benefit most from dialog state
tracking are those with less discriminative
speech recognition confidence scores. Fi-
nally, generalization is a key problem: in
2 of the 4 test sets, fewer than half of the
entries out-performed simple baselines.

1 Overview and motivation

Spoken dialog systems interact with users via nat-
ural language to help them achieve a goal. As the
interaction progresses, the dialog manager main-
tains a representation of the state of the dialog
in a process called dialog state tracking (DST).
For example, in a bus schedule information sys-
tem, the dialog state might indicate the user’s de-
sired bus route, origin, and destination. Dialog
state tracking is difficult because automatic speech

stitute, Mountain View, CA, USA

recognition (ASR) and spoken language under-
standing (SLU) errors are common, and can cause
the system to misunderstand the user’s needs. At
the same time, state tracking is crucial because
the system relies on the estimated dialog state to
choose actions – for example, which bus schedule
information to present to the user.

Most commercial systems use hand-crafted
heuristics for state tracking, selecting the SLU re-
sult with the highest confidence score, and dis-
carding alternatives. In contrast, statistical ap-
proaches compute scores for many hypotheses for
the dialog state (Figure 1). By exploiting correla-
tions between turns and information from external
data sources – such as maps, bus timetables, or
models of past dialogs – statistical approaches can
overcome some SLU errors.

Numerous techniques for dialog state tracking
have been proposed, including heuristic scores
(Higashinaka et al., 2003), Bayesian networks
(Paek and Horvitz, 2000; Williams and Young,
2007), kernel density estimators (Ma et al., 2012),
and discriminative models (Bohus and Rudnicky,
2006). Techniques have been fielded which scale
to realistically sized dialog problems and operate
in real time (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and
Young, 2010; Williams, 2010; Mehta et al., 2010).
In end-to-end dialog systems, dialog state tracking
has been shown to improve overall system perfor-
mance (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young,
2010).

Despite this progress, direct comparisons be-
tween methods have not been possible because
past studies use different domains and system
components, for speech recognition, spoken lan-
guage understanding, dialog control, etc. More-
over, there is little agreement on how to evaluate
dialog state tracking. Together these issues limit
progress in this research area.

The Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC)
provides a first common testbed and evaluation

Figure 1: Overview of dialog state tracking. In this example, the dialog state contains the user’s desired
bus route. At each turn t, the system produces a spoken output. The user’s spoken response is processed
to extract a set of spoken language understanding (SLU) results, each with a local confidence score. A
set of Nt dialog state hypotheses is formed by considering all SLU results observed so far, including the
current turn and all previous turns. Here, N1 = 3 and N2 = 5. The dialog state tracker uses features of
the dialog context to produce a distribution over all Nt hypotheses and the meta-hypothesis that none of
them are correct.

suite for dialog state tracking. The DSTC orga-
nizers made available a public, heterogeneous cor-
pus of over 15K transcribed and labeled human-
computer dialogs. Nine teams entered the chal-
lenge, anonymously submitting a total of 27 dialog
state trackers.

This paper serves two roles. First, sections 2
and 3 provide an overview of the challenge, data,
and evaluation metrics, all of which will remain
publicly available to the community (DST, 2013).
Second, this paper summarizes the results of the
challenge, with an emphasis on gaining new in-
sights into the dialog state tracking problem, in
Section 4. Section 5 briefly concludes.

2 Challenge overview

2.1 Problem statement
First, we define the dialog state tracking problem.
A dialog state tracker takes as input all of the ob-
servable elements up to time t in a dialog, includ-
ing all of the results from the automatic speech

recognition (ASR) and spoken language under-
standing (SLU) components, and external knowl-
edge sources such as bus timetable databases and
models of past dialogs. It also takes as input a
set of Nt possible dialog state hypotheses, where
a hypothesis is an assignment of values to slots in
the system. The tracker outputs a probability dis-
tribution over the set of Nt hypotheses, and the
meta-hypothesis REST which indicates that none
of them are correct. The goal is to assign probabil-
ity 1.0 to the correct state, and 0.0 to other states.
Note that the set of dialog states is given. Also
note that Nt varies with t – typically as the dia-
log progresses and more concepts are discussed,
the number of candidate hypotheses increases. An
example is given in Figure 1.

In this challenge, dialog states are generated in
the usual way, by enumerating all slots values that
have appeared in the SLU N-best lists or system
output up until the current turn. While this ap-
proach precludes a tracker assigning a score to an

405



SLU value that has not been observed, the cardi-
nality of the slots is generally large, so the likeli-
hood of a tracker correctly guessing a slot value
which hasn’t been observed anywhere in the input
or output is vanishingly small.

2.2 Challenge design
The dialog state tracking challenge studies this
problem as a corpus-based task – i.e., dialog state
trackers are trained and tested on a static corpus
of dialogs, recorded from systems using a variety
of state tracking models and dialog managers. The
challenge task is to re-run state tracking on these
dialogs – i.e., to take as input the runtime system
logs including the SLU results and system output,
and to output scores for dialog states formed from
the runtime SLU results. This corpus-based de-
sign was chosen because it allows different track-
ers to be evaluated on the same data, and because a
corpus-based task has a much lower barrier to en-
try for research groups than building an end-to-end
dialog system.

In practice of course, a state tracker will be used
in an end-to-end dialog system, and will drive ac-
tion selection, thereby affecting the distribution of
the dialog data the tracker experiences. In other
words, it is known in advance that the distribu-
tion in the training data and live data will be mis-
matched, although the nature and extent of the
mis-match are not known. Hence, unlike much
of supervised learning research, drawing train and
test data from the same distribution in offline ex-
periments may overstate performance. So in the
DSTC, train/test mis-match was explicitly created
by choosing test data to be from different dialog
systems.

2.3 Source data and challenge corpora
The DSTC uses data from the public deployment
of several systems in the Spoken Dialog Challenge
(SDC) (Black et al., 2010), provided by the Dialog
Research Center at Carnegie Mellon University. In
the SDC, telephone calls from real passengers of
the Port Authority of Allegheny County, who runs
city buses in Pittsburgh, were forwarded to dialog
systems built by different research groups. The
goal was to provide bus riders with bus timetable
information. For example, a caller might want
to find out the time of the next bus leaving from
Downtown to the airport.

The SDC received dialog systems from three
different research groups, here called Groups A,

B, and C. Each group used its own ASR, SLU,
and dialog manager. The dialog strategies across
groups varied considerably: for example, Groups
A and C used a mixed-initiative design, where the
system could recognize any concept at any turn,
but Group B used a directed design, where the
system asked for concepts sequentially and could
only recognize the concept being queried. Groups
trialled different system variants over a period of
almost 3 years. These variants differed in acoustic
and language models, confidence scoring model,
state tracking method and parameters, number of
supported bus routes, user population, and pres-
ence of minor bugs. Example dialogs from each
group are shown in the Appendix.

The dialog data was partitioned into 5 train-
ing corpora and 4 testing corpora (Table 1).
The partioning was intended to explore different
types of mis-match between the training and test
data. Specifically, the dialog system in TRAIN1A,
TRAIN1B, TRAIN1C, TRAIN2, and TEST1 are all
very similar, so TEST1 tests the case where there
is a large amount of similar data. TEST2 uses the
same ASR and SLU but a different dialog con-
troller, so tests the case where there is a large
amount of somewhat similar data. TEST3 is very
similar to TRAIN3 and tests the case where there
is a small amount of similar data. TEST4 uses a
completely different dialog system to any of the
training data.

2.4 Data preparation

The dialog system log data from all three groups
was converted to a common format, which
described SLU results and system output using
a uniform set of dialog acts. For example, the
system speech East Pittsburgh Bus Schedules.
Say a bus route, like 28X, or say I’m not sure.
was represented as hello(), request(route), exam-
ple(route=28x), example(route=dontknow). The
user ASR hypothesis the next 61c from oakland to
mckeesport transportation center was represented
as inform(time.rel=next), inform(route=61c),
inform(from.neighborhood=oakland), in-
form(to.desc=“mckeesport transportation
center”). In this domain there were a total
of 9 slots: the bus route, date, time, and three
components each for the origin and destination,
corresponding to streets, neighborhoods, and
points-of-interest like universities. For complete
details see (Williams et al., 2012).

named entity types such as bus route, origin neighborhood, date, time, etc. N-best SLU Recall indicates
the fraction of concepts which appear anywhere on the SLU N-best list.

Group B and C systems produced N-best lists
of ASR and SLU output, which were included in
the log files. Group A systems produced only 1-
best lists, so for Group A systems, recognition was
re-run with the Pocketsphinx speech recognizer
(Huggins-Daines et al., 2006) with N-best output
enabled, and the results were included in the log
files.

Some information in the raw system logs was
specific to a group. For example, Group B’s logs
included information about word confusion net-
works, but other groups did not. All of this infor-
mation was included in a “system specific” sec-
tion of the log files. Group A logs contained about
40 system-specific name/value pairs per turn, and
Group B about 600 system-specific name/value
pairs per turn. Group C logs contained no system
specific data.

3 Labeling and evaluation design

The output of a dialog state tracker is a proba-
bility distribution over a set of given dialog state
hypotheses, plus the REST meta-hypothesis. To
evaluate this output, a label is needed for each di-
alog state hypothesis indicating its correctness.

In this task-oriented domain, we note that the
user enters the call with a specific goal in mind.
Further, when goal changes do occur, they are
usually explicitly marked: since all of the sys-

tems first collect slot values, and then provide bus
timetables, if the user wishes to change their goal,
they need to start over from the beginning. These
“start over” transitions are obvious in the logs.
This structure allows the correctness of each di-
alog state to be equated to the correctness of the
SLU items it contains. As a result, in the DSTC
we labeled the correctness of SLU hypotheses in
each turn, and then assumed these labels remain
valid until either the call ends, or until a “start
over” event. Thus to produce the labels, the la-
beling task followed was to assign a correctness
value to every SLU hypothesis on the N-best list,
given a transcript of the words actually spoken in
the dialog up to the current turn.

To accomplish this, first all user speech was
transcribed. The TRAIN1 datasets had been tran-
scribed using crowd-sourcing in a prior project
(Parent and Eskenazi, 2010); the remainder were
transcribed by professionals. Then each SLU hy-
pothesis was labled as correct or incorrect. When a
transcription exactly and unambiguously matched
a recognized slot value, such as the bus route
“sixty one c”, labels were assigned automati-
cally. The remainder were assigned using crowd-
sourcing, where three workers were shown the true
words spoken and the recognized concept, and
asked to indicate if the recognized concept was
correct – even if it did not match the recognized
words exactly. Workers were also shown dialog

history, which helps decipher the user’s meaning
when their speech was ambiguous. If the 3 work-
ers were not unanimous in their labels (about 4%
of all turns), the item was labeled manually by the
organizers. The REST meta-hypothesis was not
explicitly labeled; rather, it was deemed to be cor-
rect if none of the prior SLU results were labeled
as correct.

In this challenge, state tracking performance
was measured on each of the 9 slots separately,
and also on a joint dialog state consisting of all the
slots. So at each turn in the dialog, a tracker output
10 scored lists: one for each slot, plus a 10th list
where each dialog state contains values from all
slots. Scores were constrained to be in the range
[0, 1] and to sum to 1.

To evaluate tracker output, at each turn, each hy-
pothesis (including REST) on each of the 10 lists
was labeled as correct or incorrect by looking up
its corresponding SLU label(s). The scores and la-
bels over all of the dialogs were then compiled to
compute 11 metrics. Accuracy measures the per-
cent of turns where the top-ranked hypothesis is
correct. This indicates the correctness of the item
with the maximum score. L2 measures the L2 dis-
tance between the vector of scores, and a vector of
zeros with 1 in the position of the correct hypoth-
esis. This indicates the quality of all scores, when
the scores as viewed as probabilities.

AvgP measures the mean score of the first cor-
rect hypothesis. This indicates the quality of the
score assigned to the correct hypothesis, ignoring
the distribution of scores to incorrect hypotheses.
MRR measures the mean reciprocal rank of the
first correct hypothesis. This indicates the quality
of the ordering the scores produces (without nec-
essarily treating the scores as probabilities).

The remaining measures relate to receiver-
operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which
measure the discrimination of the score for the
highest-ranked state hypothesis. Two versions
of ROC are computed – V1 and V2. V1 com-
putes correct-accepts (CA), false-accepts (FA),
and false-rejects (FR) as fractions of all utter-
ances, so for example

CA.V 1(s) =
#CA(s)

N
(1)

where #CA(s) indicates the number of correctly
accepted states when only those states with score
≥ s are accepted, and N is the total number
of states in the sample. The V1 metrics are a

useful indication of overall performance because
they combine discrimination and overall accuracy
– i.e., the maximum CA.V 1(s) value is equal to
accuracy computed above.

V2 considers fractions of correctly classified ut-
terances, so for example

CA.V 2(s) =
#CA(s)

#CA(0)
. (2)

The V2 metrics are useful because they measure
the discrimination of the scoring independently of
accuracy – i.e., the maximum value of CA.V 2(s)
is always 1, regardless of accuracy.

From these ROC statistics, several met-
rics are computed. ROC.V1.EER computes
FA.V 1(s) where FA.V 1(s) = FR.V 1(s).
The metrics ROC.V1.CA05, ROC.V1.CA10,
and ROC.V1.CA20 compute CA.V 1(s) when
FA.V 1(s) = 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 respec-
tively. ROC.V2.CA05, ROC.V2.CA10, and
ROC.V2.CA20 do the same using the V2 ver-
sions.

Apart from what to measure, there is currently
no standard that specifies when to measure – i.e.,
which turns to include when computing each met-
ric. So for this challenge, a set of 3 schedules were
used. schedule1 includes every turn. schedule2
include turns where the target slot is either present
on the SLU N-best list, or where the target slot
is included in a system confirmation action – i.e.,
where there is some observable new information

last turn of a dialog.

In sum, for each tracker, one measurement is re-
ported for each test set (4), schedule (3), and met-
ric (11) for each of the 9 slots, the “joint” slot, and
a weighted average of the individual slots (11), for
a total of 4 · 3 · 11 · 11 = 1452 measurements per
tracker. In addition, each tracker reported average
latency per turn – this ranged from 10ms to 1s.

3.1 Baseline trackers

For comparisons, two simple baselines were im-
plemented. The first (Baseline0) is a majority
class baseline that always guesses REST with
score 1. The second (Baseline1) follows simple
rules which are commonly used in spoken dialog
systems. It maintains a single hypothesis for each
slot. Its value is the SLU 1-best with the highest
confidence score observed so far, with score equal
to that SLU item’s confidence score.

4 Results and discussion

Logistically, the training data and labels, bus
timetable database, scoring scripts, and baseline
system were publicly released in late December
2012. The test data (without labels) was released
on 22 March 2013, and teams were given a week to
run their trackers and send results back to the orga-
nizers for evaluation. After the evaluation, the test
labels were published. Each team could enter up
to 5 trackers. For the evaluation, teams were asked
to process the test dialogs online – i.e., to make a

researchers at any institution, including the orga-
nizers and advisory board. To encourage partici-
pation, the organizers agreed not to identify par-
ticipants in publications, and there was no require-
ment to disclose how trackers were implemented.

9 teams entered the DSTC, submitting a total of
27 trackers. The raw output and all 1452 measure-
ments for each tracker (and the 2 baselines) are
available from the DSTC homepage (DST, 2013).

4.1 Analysis of trackers and datasets

We begin by looking at one illustrative metric,
schedule2 accuracy averaged over slots, which
measures the accuracy of the top dialog hypothe-
sis for every slot when it either appears on the SLU
N-best list or is confirmed by the system.1 Results
in Figure 2 show two key trends. First, relative
to the baselines, performance on the test data is
markedly lower than the training data. Comparing
TRAIN2 to TEST1/TEST2 and TRAIN3 to TEST3,
the relative gain over the baselines is much lower
on test data. Moreover, only 38% of trackers per-
formed better than a simple majority-class base-
line on TEST4, for which there was no matched
training data. These findings suggests that gen-
eralization is an important open issues for dialog
state trackers.

Second, Figure 2 indicates that the gains made

trackers for TEST3 and TEST4 assigned the highest score to an SLU hypothesis other than the top in a
non-trivial percent of turns.

by the trackers over the baselines are larger
for Group A systems (TEST1 and TEST2) than
for Group B (TEST3) and C (TEST4) systems.
Whereas the baselines consider only the top SLU
hypothesis, statistical trackers can make use of
the entire N-best list, increasing recall – compare
the 1-best and N-best SLU recall rates in Table 1.
However, Group A trackers almost never assigned
the highest score to an item below the top position
in the SLU N-best list. Rather, the larger gains for
Group A systems seem due to the relatively poor
discrimination of Group A’s SLU confidence score
(Figure 3): whereas the trackers use a multitude
of features to assign scores, the baselines rely en-
tirely on the SLU confidence for their scores, so
undiscriminative SLU confidence measures ham-
per baseline performance.

4.2 Analysis of metrics

This challenge makes it possible to study the em-
pirical differences among the evaluation metrics.
Intuitively, if the purpose of a metric is to order

a set of trackers from best to worst, then 2 met-
rics are similar if they yield a similar ordering over
trackers. Specifically, for every metricm, we have
a value x(m, d, s, t) where d is the dataset, and
s is the evaluation schedule, and t is the tracker.
We define r(m, d, s, t) as the rank of tracker t
when ordered using metric m, dataset d and eval-
uation schedule s. Using these ranks, we compute
Kendall’s Tau for every d, s, and pair of metrics
m1 and m2 (Kendall, 1938). We then compute the
average Kendall’s Tau for m1 and m2 by averag-
ing over all d and s.2

Results are in Figure 6. Here we see 4 natu-
ral clusters emerge: a cluster for correctness with
Accuracy, MRR, and the ROC.V1.CA measures; a
cluster for probability quality with L2 and Aver-
age score; and two clusters for score discrimina-
tion – one with ROC.V1.EER and the other with
the three ROC.V2 metrics. This finding suggest

2A similar analysis over schedules showed that the differ-
ences in ranking for different schedules were smaller than for
metrics.

Figure 6: Average divergence between rank orderings produced by different metrics. The size of a circle
at (x, y) is given by 1−τ , where τ is the average Kendall’s Tau computed on the rank orderings produced
by methods x and y. Larger circles indicate dissimilar rankings; smaller circles indicate similar rankings;
missing circles indicate identical rankings. The red boxes indicate groups of metrics that yield similar
rankings.

that measuring one metric from each cluster will
contain nearly the same information as all 9 met-
rics. For example, one might report only Accu-
racy, L2, ROC.V1.EER, and ROC.V2.CA5.

Using these 4 metrics, we rank-ordered each
tracker, using schedule2 and a weighted average
of all slots. We then computed the average rank
across the 4 test sets. Finally we selected the set
of trackers with the top three average ranks for
each metric. Results in Figure 4 emphasize that
different trackers are tuned for different perfor-
mance measures, and the optimal tracking algo-
rithm depends crucially on the target performance
measure.

5 Conclusion

The dialog state tracking challenge has provided
the first common testbed for this task. The data,
evaluation tools, and baselines will continue to be
freely available to the research community (DST,
2013). The details of the trackers themselves will
be published at SIGDIAL 2013.

The results of the challenge show that the
suite of performance metrics cluster into 4 natural
groups. We also find that larger gains over conven-
tional rule-based baselines are present in dialog

systems where the speech recognition confidence
score has poor discrimination. Finally, we observe
substantial limitations on generalization: in mis-
matched conditions, around half of the trackers en-
tered did not exceed the performance of two sim-
ple baselines.

In future work, it should be verified that im-
provements in dialog state tracking lead to im-
provements in end-to-end dialog performance
(e.g., task completion, user satisfaction, etc.). In
addition, it would be interesting to study dialogs
where goal changes are more common.
