Abstract

Language models (LMs) are statistical mod-
els that calculate probabilities over sequences
of words or other discrete symbols. Currently
two major paradigms for language model-
ing exist: count-based n-gram models, which
have advantages of scalability and test-time
speed, and neural LMs, which often achieve
superior modeling performance. We demon-
strate how both varieties of models can be uni-
fied in a single modeling framework that de-
fines a set of probability distributions over the
vocabulary of words, and then dynamically
calculates mixture weights over these distri-
butions. This formulation allows us to create
novel hybrid models that combine the desir-
able features of count-based and neural LMs,
and experiments demonstrate the advantages
of these approaches.1

1 Introduction

Language models (LMs) are statistical models that,
given a sentence wI1 := w1, . . . , wI , calculate its
probability P (wI1). LMs are widely used in applica-
tions such as machine translation and speech recog-
nition, and because of their broad applicability they
have also been widely studied in the literature. The
most traditional and broadly used language model-
ing paradigm is that of count-based LMs, usually
smoothed n-grams (Witten and Bell, 1991; Chen

1Work was performed while GN was at the Nara Institute of
Science and Technology and CD was at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. Code and data to reproduce experiments is available at
http://github.com/neubig/modlm

and Goodman, 1996). Recently, there has been a fo-
cus on LMs based on neural networks (Nakamura
et al., 1990; Bengio et al., 2006; Mikolov et al.,
2010), which have shown impressive improvements
in performance over count-based LMs. On the other
hand, these neural LMs also come at the cost of in-
creased computational complexity at both training
and test time, and even the largest reported neural
LMs (Chen et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015) are
trained on a fraction of the data of their count-based
counterparts (Brants et al., 2007).

In this paper we focus on a class of LMs,
which we will call mixture of distributions LMs
(MODLMs; §2). Specifically, we define MODLMs
as all LMs that take the following form, calculat-
ing the probabilities of the next word in a sentence
wi given preceding context c according to a mix-
ture of several component probability distributions
Pk(wi|c):

P (wi|c) =
K∑

k=1

λk(c)Pk(wi|c). (1)

Here, λk(c) is a function that defines the mixture
weights, with the constraint that

∑K
k=1 λk(c) = 1

for all c. This form is not new in itself, and widely
used both in the calculation of smoothing coeffi-
cients for n-gram LMs (Chen and Goodman, 1996),
and interpolation of LMs of various varieties (Je-
linek and Mercer, 1980).

The main contribution of this paper is to demon-
strate that depending on our definition of c, λk(c),
and Pk(wi|c), Eq. 1 can be used to describe not only
n-gram models, but also feed-forward (Nakamura et
al., 1990; Bengio et al., 2006; Schwenk, 2007) and

1163



recurrent (Mikolov et al., 2010; Sundermeyer et al.,
2012) neural network LMs (§3). This observation
is useful theoretically, as it provides a single mathe-
matical framework that encompasses several widely
used classes of LMs. It is also useful practically, in
that this new view of these traditional models allows
us to create new models that combine the desirable
features of n-gram and neural models, such as:

neurally interpolated n-gram LMs (§4.1), which
learn the interpolation weights of n-gram
models using neural networks, and

neural/n-gram hybrid LMs (§4.2), which add a
count-based n-gram component to neural mod-
els, allowing for flexibility to add large-scale
external data sources to neural LMs.

We discuss learning methods for these models (§5)
including a novel method of randomly dropping out
more easy-to-learn distributions to prevent the pa-
rameters from falling into sub-optimal local minima.

Experiments on language modeling benchmarks
(§6) find that these models outperform baselines in
terms of performance and convergence speed.

2 Mixture of Distributions LMs

As mentioned above, MODLMs are LMs that take
the form of Eq. 1. This can be re-framed as the fol-
lowing matrix-vector multiplication:

pᵀc = Dcλ
ᵀ
c,

where pc is a vector with length equal to vocabulary
size, in which the jth element pc,j corresponds to
P (wi = j|c), λc is a size K vector that contains the
mixture weights for the distributions, and Dc is a J-
by-K matrix, where element dc,j,k is equivalent to
the probability Pk(wi = j|c).2 An example of this
formulation is shown in Fig. 1.

Note that all columns in D represent probability
distributions, and thus must sum to one over the J
words in the vocabulary, and that all λ must sum
to 1 over the K distributions. Under this condition,
the vector pwill represent a well-formed probability
distribution as well. This conveniently allows us to

2We omit the subscript c when appropriate.

In the sequel we show how this formulation can be
used to describe several existing LMs (§3) as well as
several novel model structures that are more power-
ful and general than these existing models (§4).

3 Existing LMs as Linear Mixtures

3.1 n-gram LMs as Mixtures of Distributions

First, we discuss how count-based interpolated n-
gram LMs fit within the MODLM framework.

Maximum likelihood estimation: n-gram mod-
els predict the next word based on the previous N -1
words. In other words, we set c = wi−1i−N+1 and
calculate P (wi|wi−1i−N+1). The maximum-likelihood
(ML) estimate for this probability is

PML(wi|wi−1i−N+1) = c(wii−N+1)/c(wi−1i−N+1),

where c(·) counts frequency in the training corpus.
Interpolation: Because ML estimation as-

signs zero probability to word sequences where
c(wii−N+1) = 0, n-gram models often interpolate
the ML distributions for sequences of length 1 to N .
The simplest form is static interpolation

P (wi|wi−1i−n+1) =
N∑

n=1

λS,nPML(wi|wi−1i−n+1). (2)

λS is a vector where λS,n represents the weight
put on the distribution PML(wi|wi−1i−n+1). This can
be expressed as linear equations (Fig. 2a) by set-
ting the nth column of D to the ML distribution
PML(wi|wi−1i−n+1), and λ(c) equal to λS .

Figure 2: Interpretations of existing models as mixtures of distributions

Static interpolation can be improved by calcu-
lating λ(c) dynamically, using heuristics based on
the frequency counts of the context (Good, 1953;
Katz, 1987; Witten and Bell, 1991). These meth-
ods define a context-sensitive fallback probability
α(wi−1i−n+1) for order n models, and recursively cal-
culate the probability of the higher order models
from the lower order models:

P (wi|wi−1i−n+1) = α(wi−1i−n+1)P (wi|wi−1i−n+2)+
(1− α(wi−1i−n+1))PML(wi|wi−1i−n+1). (3)

To express this as a linear mixture, we con-
vert α(wi−1i−n+1) into the appropriate value for
λn(w

i−1
i−N+1). Specifically, the probability assigned

to each PML(wi|wi−1i−n+1) is set to the product of the
fallbacks α for all higher orders and the probability
of not falling back (1− α) at the current level:

λn(w
i−1
i−N+1) = (1−α(wi−1i−n+1))

N∏

ñ=n+1

α(wi−1i−ñ+1).

Discounting: The widely used technique of dis-
counting (Ney et al., 1994) defines a fixed discount
d and subtracts it from the count of each word before
calculating probabilities:

PD(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = (c(wii−n+1)− d)/c(wi−1i−n+1).

Discounted LMs then assign the remaining probabil-
ity mass after discounting as the fallback probability

βD(w
i−1
i−n+1) =1−

J∑

j=1

PD(wi = j|wi−1i−n+1),

P (wi|wi−1i−n+1) =βD(wi−1i−n+1)P (wi|wi−1i−n+2)+
PD(wi|wi−1i−n+1). (4)

In this case, PD(·) does not add to one, and thus vi-
olates the conditions for MODLMs stated in §2, but
it is easy to turn discounted LMs into interpolated
LMs by normalizing the discounted distribution:

PND(wi|wi−1i−n+1) =
PD(wi|wi−1i−n+1)∑J

j=1 PD(wi = j|wi−1i−n+1)
,

which allows us to replace β(·) for α(·) and PND(·)
for PML(·) in Eq. 3, and proceed as normal.

Kneser–Ney (KN; Kneser and Ney (1995)) and
Modified KN (Chen and Goodman, 1996) smooth-
ing further improve discounted LMs by adjusting the
counts of lower-order distributions to more closely
match their expectations as fallbacks for higher or-
der distributions. Modified KN is currently the de-
facto standard in n-gram LMs despite occasional
improvements (Teh, 2006; Durrett and Klein, 2011),
and we will express it as PKN (·).

3.2 Neural LMs as Mixtures of Distributions

In this section we demonstrate how neural network
LMs can also be viewed as an instantiation of the
MODLM framework.

Feed-forward neural network LMs: Feed-
forward LMs (Bengio et al., 2006; Schwenk, 2007)
are LMs that, like n-grams, calculate the prob-
ability of the next word based on the previous
words. Given context wi−1i−N+1, these words are
converted into real-valued word representation vec-
tors ri−1i−N+1, which are concatenated into an over-
all representation vector q = ⊕(ri−1i−N+1), where
⊕(·) is the vector concatenation function. q is then
run through a series of affine transforms and non-
linearities defined as function NN(q) to obtain a
vector h. For example, for a one-layer neural net-

Figure 3: Two new expansions to n-gram and neural LMs made possible in the MODLM framework

work with a tanh non-linearity we can define

NN(q) := tanh(qWq + bq), (5)

where Wq and bq are weight matrix and bias vec-
tor parameters respectively. Finally, the probabil-
ity vector p is calculated using the softmax function
p = softmax(hWs + bs), similarly parameterized.

As these models are directly predicting p with no
concept of mixture weights λ, they cannot be inter-
preted as MODLMs as-is. However, we can per-
form a trick shown in Fig. 2b, not calculating p di-
rectly, but instead calculating mixture weights λ =
softmax(hWs + bs), and defining the MODLM’s
distribution matrix D as a J-by-J identity matrix.
This is equivalent to defining a linear mixture of J
Kronecker δj distributions, the jth of which assigns
a probability of 1 to word j and zero to everything
else, and estimating the mixture weights with a neu-
ral network. While it may not be clear why it is use-
ful to define neural LMs in this somewhat round-
about way, we describe in §4 how this opens up pos-
sibilities for novel expansions to standard models.

Recurrent neural network LMs: LMs using
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Mikolov et al.,
2010) consider not the previous few words, but also
maintain a hidden state summarizing the sentence up
until this point by re-defining the net in Eq. 5 as

RNN(qi) := tanh(qiWq + hi−1Wh + bq),

where qi is the current input vector and hi−1 is the
hidden vector at the previous time step. This allows
for consideration of long-distance dependencies be-
yond the scope of standard n-grams, and LMs using
RNNs or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks
(Sundermeyer et al., 2012) have posted large im-
provements over standard n-grams and feed-forward

models. Like feed-forward LMs, LMs using RNNs
can be expressed as MODLMs by predicting λ in-
stead of predicting p directly.

4 Novel Applications of MODLMs

This section describes how we can use this frame-
work of MODLMs to design new varieties of LMs
that combine the advantages of both n-gram and
neural network LMs.

4.1 Neurally Interpolated n-gram Models

The first novel instantiation of MODLMs that we
propose is neurally interpolated n-gram models,
shown in Fig. 3a. In these models, we setD to be the
same matrix used in n-gram LMs, but calculateλ(c)
using a neural network model. As λ(c) is learned
from data, this framework has the potential to allow
us to learn more intelligent interpolation functions
than the heuristics described in §3.1. In addition,
because the neural network only has to calculate a
softmax over N distributions instead of J vocabu-
lary words, training and test efficiency of these mod-
els can be expected to be much greater than that of
standard neural network LMs.

Within this framework, there are several design
decisions. First, how we decide D: do we use the
maximum likelihood estimate PML or KN estimated
distributions PKN? Second, what do we provide as
input to the neural network to calculate the mixture
weights? To provide the neural net with the same
information used by interpolation heuristics used in
traditional LMs, we first calculate three features for
each of the N contexts wi−1i−n+1: a binary feature in-
dicating whether the context has been observed in
the training corpus (c(wi−1i−n+1) > 0), the log fre-
quency of the context counts (log(c(wi−1i−n+1)) or

1166



zero for unobserved contexts), and the log frequency
of the number of unique words following the context
(log(u(wi−1i−n+1)) or likewise zero). When using dis-
counted distributions, we also use the log of the sum
of the discounted counts as a feature. We can also
optionally use the word representation vector q used
in neural LMs, allowing for richer representation of
the input, but this may or may not be necessary in the
face of the already informative count-based features.

4.2 Neural/n-gram Hybrid Models

Our second novel model enabled by MODLMs is
neural/n-gram hybrid models, shown in Fig. 3b.
These models are similar to neurally interpolated
n-grams, but D is augmented with J additional
columns representing the Kronecker δj distributions
used in the standard neural LMs. In this construc-
tion, λ is still a stochastic vector, but its contents
are both the mixture coefficients for the count-based
models and direct predictions of the probabilities of
words. Thus, the learned LM can use count-based
models when they are deemed accurate, and deviate
from them when deemed necessary.

This model is attractive conceptually for several
reasons. First, it has access to all information used
by both neural and n-gram LMs, and should be able
to perform as well or better than both models. Sec-
ond, the efficiently calculated n-gram counts are
likely sufficient to capture many phenomena nec-
essary for language modeling, allowing the neural
component to focus on learning only the phenom-
ena that are not well modeled by n-grams, requiring
fewer parameters and less training time. Third, it is
possible to train n-grams from much larger amounts
of data, and use these massive models to bootstrap
learning of neural nets on smaller datasets.

5 Learning Mixtures of Distributions

While the MODLM formulations of standard heuris-
tic n-gram LMs do not require learning, the remain-
ing models are parameterized. This section dis-
cusses the details of learning these parameters.

5.1 Learning MODLMs

The first step in learning parameters is defining our
training objective. Like most previous work on
LMs (Bengio et al., 2006), we use a negative log-

likelihood loss summed over words wi in every sen-
tence w in corpusW

L(W) = −
∑

w∈W

∑

wi∈w
logP (wi|c),

where c represents all words preceding wi inw that
are used in the probability calculation. As noted in
Eq. 2, P (wi = j|c) can be calculated efficiently
from the distribution matrix Dc and mixture func-
tion output λc.

Given that we can calculate the log likelihood, the
remaining parts of training are similar to training for
standard neural network LMs. As usual, we per-
form forward propagation to calculate the probabili-
ties of all the words in the sentence, back-propagate
the gradients through the computation graph, and
perform some variant of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) to update the parameters.

5.2 Block Dropout for Hybrid Models
While the training method described in the previ-
ous section is similar to that of other neural network
models, we make one important modification to the
training process specifically tailored to the hybrid
models of §4.2.

This is motivated by our observation (detailed in
§6.3) that the hybrid models, despite being strictly
more expressive than the corresponding neural net-
work LMs, were falling into poor local minima with
higher training error than neural network LMs. This
is because at the very beginning of training, the
count-based elements of the distribution matrix in
Fig. 3b are already good approximations of the tar-
get distribution, while the weights of the single-word
δj distributions are not yet able to provide accurate
probabilities. Thus, the model learns to set the mix-
ture proportions of the δ elements to near zero and
rely mainly on the count-based n-gram distributions.

To encourage the model to use the δ mixture com-
ponents, we adopt a method called block dropout
(Ammar et al., 2016). In contrast to standard
dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), which drops out
single nodes or connections, block dropout ran-
domly drops out entire subsets of network nodes. In
our case, we want to prevent the network from over-
using the count-based n-gram distributions, so for a
randomly selected portion of the training examples
(here, 50%) we disable all n-gram distributions and

1167



force the model to rely on only the δ distributions.
To do so, we zero out all elements in λ(c) that cor-
respond to n-gram distributions, and re-normalize
over the rest of the elements so they sum to one.

5.3 Network and Training Details

Finally, we note design details that were determined
based on preliminary experiments.

Network structures: We used both feed-forward
networks with tanh non-linearities and LSTM
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) networks.
Most experiments used single-layer 200-node net-
works, and 400-node networks were used for ex-
periments with larger training data. Word repre-
sentations were the same size as the hidden layer.
Larger and multi-layer networks did not yield im-
provements.

Training: We used ADAM (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with a learning rate of 0.001, and minibatch
sizes of 512 words. This led to faster convergence
than standard SGD, and more stable optimization
than other update rules. Models were evaluated ev-
ery 500k-3M words, and the model with the best de-
velopment likelihood was used. In addition to the
block dropout of §5.2, we used standard dropout
with a rate of 0.5 for both feed-forward (Srivastava
et al., 2014) and LSTM (Pham et al., 2014) nets in
the neural LMs and neural/n-gram hybrids, but not
in the neurally interpolated n-grams, where it re-
sulted in slightly worse perplexities.

Features: If parameters are learned on the data
used to train count-based models, they will heav-
ily over-fit and learn to trust the count-based distri-
butions too much. To prevent this, we performed
10-fold cross validation, calculating count-based el-
ements of D for each fold with counts trained on the
other 9/10. In addition, the count-based contextual
features in §4.1 were normalized by subtracting the
training set mean, which improved performance.

6 Experiments

6.1 Experimental Setup

In this section, we perform experiments to eval-
uate the neurally interpolated n-grams (§6.2) and
neural/n-gram hybrids (§6.3), the ability of our mod-
els to take advantage of information from large data
sets (§6.4), and the relative performance compared

to post-facto static interpolation of already-trained
models (§6.5). For the main experiments, we evalu-
ate on two corpora: the Penn Treebank (PTB) data
set prepared by Mikolov et al. (2010),3 and the first
100k sentences in the English side of the ASPEC
corpus (Nakazawa et al., 2015)4 (details in Tab. 1).
The PTB corpus uses the standard vocabulary of 10k
words, and for the ASPEC corpus we use a vocabu-
lary of the 20k most frequent words. Our implemen-
tation is included as supplementary material.

6.2 Results for Neurally Interpolated n-grams

First, we investigate the utility of neurally interpo-
lated n-grams. In all cases, we use a history of
N = 5 and test several different settings for the
models:

Estimation type: λ(c) is calculated with heuris-
tics (HEUR) or by the proposed method using feed-
forward (FF), or LSTM nets.

Distributions: We compare PML(·) and PKN (·).
For heuristics, we use Witten-Bell for ML and the
appropriate discounted probabilities for KN.

Input features: As input features for the neural
network, we either use only the count-based features
(C) or count-based features together with the word
representation for the single previous word (CR).

From the results shown in Tab. 2, we can first see
that when comparing models using the same set of

3http://rnnlm.org/simple-examples.tgz
4http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ASPEC/

1168



input distributions, the neurally interpolated model
outperforms corresponding heuristic methods. We
can also see that LSTMs have a slight advantage
over FF nets, and models using word representa-
tions have a slight advantage over those that use
only the count-based features. Overall, the best
model achieves a relative perplexity reduction of 4-
5% over KN models. Interestingly, even when using
simple ML distributions, the best neurally interpo-
lated n-gram model nearly matches the heuristic KN
method, demonstrating that the proposed model can
automatically learn interpolation functions that are
nearly as effective as carefully designed heuristics.5

6.3 Results for Neural/n-gram Hybrids

In experiments with hybrid models, we test a
neural/n-gram hybrid LM using LSTM networks
with both Kronecker δ and KN smoothed 5-gram
distributions, trained either with or without block
dropout. As our main baseline, we compare to
LSTMs with only δ distributions, which have re-
ported competitive numbers on the PTB data set
(Zaremba et al., 2014).6 We also report results for
heuristically smoothed KN 5-gram models, and the
best neurally interpolated n-grams from the previous
section for reference.

The results, shown in Tab. 3, demonstrate that
similarly to previous research, LSTM LMs (2)
achieve a large improvement in perplexity over n-
gram models, and that the proposed neural/n-gram
hybrid method (5) further reduces perplexity by 10-
11% relative over this strong baseline.

Comparing models without (4) and with (5) the
proposed block dropout, we can see that this method
contributes significantly to these gains. To examine
this more closely, we show the test perplexity for the

5Neurally interpolated n-grams are also more efficient than
standard neural LMs, as mentioned in §4.1. While a standard
LSTM LM calculated 1.4kw/s on the PTB data, the neurally in-
terpolated models using LSTMs and FF nets calculated 11kw/s
and 58kw/s respectively, only slightly inferior to 140kw/s of
heuristic KN.

6Note that unlike this work, we opt to condition only on in-
sentence context, not inter-sentential dependencies, as training
through gradient calculations over sentences is more straight-
forward and because examining the effect of cross-boundary
information is not central to the proposed method. Thus our
baseline numbers are not directly comparable (i.e. have higher
perplexity) to previous reported results on this data, but we still
feel that the comparison is appropriate.

three models using δ distributions in Fig. 5, and the
amount of the probability mass in λ(c) assigned to
the non-δ distributions in the hybrid models. From
this, we can see that the model with block dropout
quickly converges to a better result than the LSTM
LM, but the model without converges to a worse
result, assigning too much probability mass to the
dense count-based distributions, demonstrating the
learning problems mentioned in §5.2.

It is also of interest to examine exactly why the
proposed model is doing better than the more stan-
dard methods. One reason can be found in the be-
havior with regards to low-frequency words. In Fig.
4, we show perplexities for words that appear n
times or less in the training corpus, for n = 10,
n = 100, n = 1000 and n = ∞ (all words).
From the results, we can first see that if we com-
pare the baselines, LSTM language models achieve
better perplexities overall but n-gram language mod-
els tend to perform better on low-frequency words,
corroborating the observations of Chen et al. (2015).

The neurally interpolated n-gram models consis-
tently outperform standard KN-smoothed n-grams,
demonstrating their superiority within this model
class. In contrast, the neural/n-gram hybrid mod-
els tend to follow a pattern more similar to that of
LSTM language models, similarly with consistently
higher performance.

6.4 Results for Larger Data Sets

To examine the ability of the hybrid models to use
counts trained over larger amounts of data, we per-
form experiments using two larger data sets:

WSJ: The PTB uses data from the 1989 Wall
Street Journal, so we add the remaining years be-
tween 1987 and 1994 (1.81M sents., 38.6M words).

GW: News data from the English Gigaword 5th
Edition (LDC2011T07, 59M sents., 1.76G words).

We incorporate this data either by training net pa-
rameters over the whole large data, or by separately
training count-based n-grams on each of PTB, WSJ,
and GW, and learning net parameters on only PTB
data. The former has the advantage of training the
net on much larger data. The latter has two main ad-
vantages: 1) when the smaller data is of a particular
domain the mixture weights can be learned to match
this in-domain data; 2) distributions can be trained
on data such as Google n-grams (LDC2006T13),
which contain n-gram counts but not full sentences.

In the results of Fig. 6, we can first see that the
neural/n-gram hybrids significantly outperform the
traditional neural LMs in the scenario with larger
data as well. Comparing the two methods for in-
corporating larger data, we can see that the results
are mixed depending on the type and size of the data

ditional n-gram distributions (5,8).

being used. For the WSJ data, training on all data
slightly outperforms the method of adding distribu-
tions, but when the GW data is added this trend re-
verses. This can be explained by the fact that the
GW data differs from the PTB test data, and thus
the effect of choosing domain-specific interpolation
coefficients was more prominent.

6.5 Comparison with Static Interpolation

Finally, because the proposed neural/n-gram hybrid
models combine the advantages of neural and n-
gram models, we compare with the more standard
method of training models independently and com-
bining them with static interpolation weights tuned
on the validation set using the EM algorithm. Tab. 4
shows perplexities for combinations of a standard
neural model (or δ distributions) trained on PTB, and
count based distributions trained on PTB, WSJ, and
GW are added one-by-one using the standard static
and proposed LSTM interpolation methods. From
the results, we can see that when only PTB data is
used, the methods have similar results, but with the
more diverse data sets the proposed method edges
out its static counterpart.7

7In addition to better perplexities, neural/n-gram hybrids are
trained in a single pass instead of performing post-facto inter-
polation, which may give advantages when training for other
objectives (Auli and Gao, 2014; Li et al., 2015).

7 Related Work

A number of alternative methods focus on interpo-
lating LMs of multiple varieties such as in-domain
and out-of-domain LMs (Bulyko et al., 2003; Bac-
chiani et al., 2006; Gülçehre et al., 2015). Perhaps
most relevant is Hsu (2007)’s work on learning to
interpolate multiple LMs using log-linear models.
This differs from our work in that it learns functions
to estimate the fallback probabilities αn(c) in Eq. 3
instead of λ(c), and does not cover interpolation of
n-gram components, non-linearities, or the connec-
tion with neural network LMs. Also conceptually
similar is work on adaptation of n-gram LMs, which
start with n-gram probabilities (Della Pietra et al.,
1992; Kneser and Steinbiss, 1993; Rosenfeld, 1996;
Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999) and adapt them based on
the distribution of the current document, albeit in a
linear model. There has also been work incorpo-
rating binary n-gram features into neural language
models, which allows for more direct learning of n-
gram weights (Mikolov et al., 2011), but does not af-
ford many of the advantages of the proposed model
such as the incorporation of count-based probability
estimates. Finally, recent works have compared n-
gram and neural models, finding that neural models
often perform better in perplexity, but n-grams have
their own advantages such as effectiveness in extrin-
sic tasks (Baltescu and Blunsom, 2015) and better
modeling of rare words (Chen et al., 2015).

8 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed a framework for lan-
guage modeling that generalizes both neural net-
work and count-based n-gram LMs. This allowed
us to learn more effective interpolation functions for
count-based n-grams, and to create neural LMs that
incorporate information from count-based models.

As the framework discussed here is general, it is
also possible that they could be used in other tasks
that perform sequential prediction of words such as

neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014)
or dialog response generation (Sordoni et al., 2015).
In addition, given the positive results using block
dropout for hybrid models, we plan to develop more
effective learning methods for mixtures of sparse
and dense distributions.
