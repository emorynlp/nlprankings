Abstract

Locating documents carrying positive or neg-
ative favourability is an important application
within media analysis. This paper presents
some empirical results on the challenges fac-
ing a machine-learning approach to this kind
of opinion mining. Some of the challenges in-
clude: the often considerable imbalance in the
distribution of positive and negative samples;
changes in the documents over time; and ef-
fective training and quantification procedures
for reporting results. This paper begins with
three datasets generated by a media-analysis
company, classifying documents in two ways:
detecting the presence of favourability, and as-
sessing negative vs. positive favourability. We
then evaluate a machine-learning approach to
automate the classification process. We ex-
plore the effect of using five different types of
features, the robustness of the models when
tested on data taken from a later time period,
and the effect of balancing the input data by
undersampling. We find varying choices for
the optimum classifier, feature set and training
strategy depending on the task and dataset.

1 Introduction

Media analysis is a discipline closely related to con-
tent analysis (Krippendorff, 2004), with an emphasis
on analysing content with respect to:

Favourability how favourable an article is with
respect to an entity. This will typically be on a five
point scale: very negative, negative, neutral, positive
or very positive.

Key messages topics or areas that a client is inter-
ested in. This allows the client to gain feedback on
the success of particular public relations campaigns,
for example.

Media analysis has traditionally been done manu-
ally, however the explosion of content on the world-
wide web, in particular social media, has led to the
introduction of automatic techniques for performing
media analysis, e.g. Tatzl and Waldhauser (2010).

In this paper, we discuss our recent findings in ap-
plying machine learning techniques to favourability
analysis. The work is part of a two-year collabo-
ration between Gorkana Group, which includes one
of the foremost media analysis companies, Metrica,
and the University of Hertfordshire. The goal is to
develop ways of automating media analysis, espe-
cially for social media. The data used are from tra-
ditional media (newspapers and magazines) since at
the time of starting the experiment there was more
manually analysed data available. We discuss the
typical problems that arise in this kind of text min-
ing, and the practical results we have found.

The documents are supplied by Durrants, the me-
dia monitoring company within the Gorkana Group,
and consist of text from newspaper and magazine
articles in electronic form. Each document is anal-
ysed by trained human analysts, given scores for
favourability, as well as other characteristics which
the client has requested. This dataset is used to pro-
vide feedback to the clients about how they are por-
trayed in the media, and is summarised by Metrica
for clients’ monthly reports.

Favourability analysis is very closely related to
sentiment analysis, with the following distinction:

44



sentiment analysis generally focuses on a (subjec-
tive) sentiment implying an opinion of the author,
for example:1

(1) Microsoft is the greattteesssst at EVERY-
THING

expresses the author’s opinion (which others may
not share) whereas favourability analysis, whilst
also taking into account sentiment, also measures
favourable objective mentions of entities. For ex-
ample:2

(2) Halloween Eve Was The Biggest Instagram
Day Ever, Doubling Its Traffic

is an objective statement (no one can doubt that the
traffic doubled) that is favourable with respect to the
organisation, Instagram. Since the task is so simi-
lar to that of sentiment analysis, we hypothesise that
similar techniques will be useful.

The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1)
whilst automated sentiment analysis has received a
lot of attention in the academic literature, favourabil-
ity analysis has so far not benefited from an in-depth
analysis. (2) We provide results on a wide variety of
different classifiers, whereas previous work on sen-
timent analysis typically considers at most two or
three different classifiers. (3) We discuss the prob-
lem of imbalanced data, looking at how this impacts
on the training and evaluation techniques. (4) We
show that both attribute selection and balancing the
classifier’s training set can improve performance.

2 Background

There is a very large body of literature on both sen-
timent analysis and machine learning; for space rea-
sons, we will mention only a small sample.

2.1 Favourability Analysis

The most closely related task to ours is arguably
opinion mining, i.e. determining sentiment with re-
spect to a particular target. Balahur et al. (2010)
examine this task for newspaper articles. They
show that separating out the objective favourabil-
ity from the expressed sentiment led to an increase

1Actually, this is an ironic comment on a blog post at
TechCrunch.

2A headline from TechCrunch

in inter-annotator agreement, which they report as
81%, after implementing improvements to the pro-
cess. Melville et al. (2009) report on an automated
system for opinion mining applied to blogs, which
achieves between 64% and 91% accuracy, depend-
ing on the domain, while Godbole et al. (2007) de-
scribe a system applied to news and blogs.

Pang et al. (2002) introduced machine learning to
perform sentiment analysis. They used naı̈ve bayes,
support vector machines (SVMs) and maximum en-
tropy on the movie review domain, and report ac-
curacies between 77% and 83% depending on the
feature set, which included unigrams, bigrams, and
part-of-speech tagged unigrams. More recent work
along these lines is described in (Pang and Lee,
2008; Prabowo and Thelwall, 2009).

One approach to sentiment analysis is to build
up a lexicon of sentiment carrying words. Turney
(2002) described a way to automatically build such a
lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences of words
with other words whose sentiment is known. This
idea was extended by Gamon et al. (2005) who also
considered the lack of co-occurrence as useful infor-
mation.

Koppel and Schler (2006) show that it is impor-
tant to distinguish the two tasks of determining neu-
tral from non-neutral sentiment, and positive versus
negative sentiment, and that doing so can signifi-
cantly improve the accuracy of automated systems.

2.2 Machine Learning Approaches

Document classification is an ideal domain for ma-
chine learning, because the raw data, the text, are
easily manipulated, and often large amounts of text
can be obtained, making the problems amenable to
statistical analysis.

A classification model is essentially a mapping,
from a document described as a set of feature values
to a class label. In most cases, this class label is a
simple yes-no choice, such as whether the document
is favourable or not. In the experimental section of
this paper we describe results from applying a range
of different classification algorithms.

In general, two issues that affect machine-
learning approaches are the selection of features,
and the presence of imbalanced data.

45



2.2.1 Features

Useful features for constructing classification
models from text documents include sets of uni-
grams, bigrams or trigrams, dependency relation-
ships or selected words: we review these features in
the next section. From a machine-learning perspec-
tive, it is useful for the features to include only rele-
vant information, and also to be independent of each
other. This feature-selection problem has been tack-
led by several authors in different ways, e.g. (Blum
and Langley, 1997; Forman, 2003; Green et al.,
2010; Mladenić, 1998; Rogati and Yang, 2002). In
our experiments, we evaluate a technique to reduce
the number of features using attribute selection.

Alternative approaches to understanding the sen-
timent of text attempt to go beyond the simple la-
belling of the presence of a word. Some authors
have described experiments augmenting the above
feature sets with additional information. Mullen and
Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add in-
formation about words found within text, and conse-
quently reports improved classification performance
in a sentiment analysis task.

2.3 Imbalanced Data

Our datasets, as is usual in many real-world applica-
tions, present varying degrees of imbalance between
the two classes. Imbalanced data must be dealt with
at two parts of the process: during training, to ensure
the model is capable of working with both classes,
and in evaluation, to ensure a model with the best
performance is selected for use on novel data. These
two elements are often treated together, but need to
be considered separately. In particular, the appropri-
ate training method to handle imbalanced data can
vary between algorithm and domain.

First considering evaluation, the standard mea-
sure of accuracy (proportion of correctly classified
examples) is inappropriate if 90% of the documents
are within one class. A simple ZeroR classifier (se-
lecting the majority class) will score highly, but it
will never get any examples of the minority class
correct. A better evaluation technique uses a combi-
nation of the separate accuracy measures on the two
classes (a1 and a2), where ai denotes the proportion
of instances from class i that were judged correctly.
For example, the geometric mean, as proposed by

Kubat et al. (1998), computes
√
a1 × a2. This has

the property that it strongly penalises poor perfor-
mance in any one class: if either a1 or a2 is zero then
the geometric mean will be zero. This characteristic
is important for our purposes, since it is “easy” to
get high accuracy on the majority class, the measure
will favour classifiers that perform well on the mi-
nority class without significant loss of accuracy in
the majority class. In addition, the geometric mean
does not give preference to any one class, unlike, for
example, the F-measure. Measures such as the av-
erage precision and recall, or F-measure, may also
prove useful, especially if preference is being given
to one class.

Second considering the training process. An im-
balanced training set can lead to bias in the construc-
tion of a machine-learning model. Such effects are
well-known in the literature, and various approaches
have been proposed to address this problem, such as
balancing the training set using under or over sam-
pling, and altering the weighting of the classifier
based on the proportion of the expected class. In our
experiments we used undersampling (where a ran-
dom sample is taken from the majority class to bal-
ance the size of the minority class); this technique
has the disadvantage of discarding training data. In
contrast, the SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2004) algo-
rithm is a technique for creating new instances of the
minority class, to balance the number in the major-
ity class. We also used geometric-mean as the eval-
uation measure for algorithms such as SVMs, when
selecting parameters.

3 Our Approach

3.1 Description of Data

The source documents have been tagged by analysts
for favourability and unfavourability, both of which
are given a non-negative score that is indicative both
of the number of favourable/unfavourable mentions
of the organisation and the degree of favourabil-
ity/unfavourability. Neutral documents are assigned
a score of zero for both favourability and unfavoura-
bility. We assign each document a class based on its
favourability f and unfavourability u scores. Docu-
ments are categorised as follows:

46



Dataset Mixed V. Neg. Negative Neutral Positive V. Pos.
A 472 86 138 1610 1506 1664
C 7 0 5 2824 852 50
S 522 94 344 9580 2057 937

Table 1: Number of documents in each class for the datasets A, C and S.

Dataset Neutral Non-neutral
A 1610 3866
C 2824 914
S 9580 3954

Table 2: Class distributions for pseudo-subjectivity task

f > 0 and u > 0: mixed
f = 0 and u > 1: very negative
f = 0 and u = 1: negative
f = 0 and u = 0: neutral
f = 1 and u = 0: positive
f > 1 and u = 0: very positive

Table 1 shows the number of documents in each
category for three datasets A, C and S, which are
anonymised to protect Metrica’s clients’ privacy. A
and S are datasets for high-tech companies, whereas
C is for a charity. This is reflected in the low oc-
curence of negative favourability with dataset C.
Datasets A and C contain only articles that are rele-
vant to the client, whereas S contains articles for the
client’s competitors. We only make use of favoura-
bility judgments with respect to the client, however,
so those that are irrelevant to the client we simply
treat as neutral. This explains the overwhelming bias
towards neutral sentiment in dataset S.

In our experiments, we consider only those doc-
uments which have been manually analysed and for
which the raw text is available. Duplicates were re-
moved from the dataset. Duplicate detection was
performed using a modified version of Ferret (Lane
et al., 2006) which compares occurrences of charac-
ter trigrams between documents. We considered two
documents to be duplicates if they had a similarity
score higher than 0.75.

This paper describes experiments for two tasks:

Pseudo-subjectivity — detecting the presence or ab-
sence of favourability. This is thus a two-class prob-
lem with neutral documents in one class, and all
other documents in the other.

Dataset Positive Negative
A 3170 224
C 902 5
S 2994 438

Table 3: Class distributions for pseudo-sentiment task

Pseudo-sentiment — distinguishing between docu-
ments with generally positive and negative favoura-
bility. In our experiments, we treat this as a two class
problem, with negative and very negative docu-
ments in one class and positive and very positive
documents in the other (ignoring mixed sentiment).

3.2 Method

We follow a similar approach to Pang et al. (2002):
we generate features from the article text, and train
a classifier using the manually analysed data.

We sorted the documents by time, and then se-
lected the earliest two thirds as a training set, and
kept the remainder as a held out test set. This al-
lows us to get an idea of how the system will per-
form when it is in use, since the system will neces-
sarily be trained on documents from an earlier time
period. We performed cross validation on the ran-
domised training set, giving us an upper bound on
the performance of the system, and we also mea-
sured the accuracy of every system on the held out
dataset. We hypothesised that new topics would be
discussed in the later time frame, and thus the accu-
racy would be lower, since the system would not be
trained on data for these topics.

We also experimented with balancing the input
data to the classifiers; each system was run twice,
once with all the input data, and once with data
which had been undersampled so that the number
of documents in each class was the same. And also
we experimented with attribute selection: reducing
the number of features used to describe the dataset.

Table 4: Example dependency relations extracted from
the data. “Type” indicates whether the term referring to
the organisation is the governor or the dependent in the
expression.

3.2.1 Features for documents

We used five types of features:
Unigrams, bigrams and trigrams: produced using
the WEKA tokenizer with the standard settings.3

EntityWords: unigrams of words occurring within
a sentence containing a mention of the organisation
in question. Mentions of the organisation were de-
tected using manually constructed regular expres-
sions, based on datasets for organisations collected
elsewhere in the company. Sentence boundary de-
tection was performed using an OpenNLP4 tool.
Dependencies: we extract dependencies using the
Stanford dependency parser. For the purpose of
this experiment, we only considered dependencies
directly connecting the term relating to the organ-
isation. Table 4 gives example dependencies ex-
tracted from the data. For example, the phrase
“. . . prompted [organisation name] to be bullish. . . ”
led to the extraction of the term bullish, where the
organisation name is the subject of the verb and the
organisation name is a dependent of the verb bullish.
For each dependency, all this information is com-
bined into a single feature.

3.3 Classification Algorithms

We used the following classifiers in our experiments:
naı̈ve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), k-
nearest neighbours with k = 1 and k = 5, radial
basis function (RBF) networks, Bayesian networks,
decision trees (J48) and a propositional rule learner,
Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Re-
duction (JRip). We also included two baseline clas-

3We used the StringToWordVectorClass constructed with an
argument of 5,000.

sifiers, ZeroR, which simply chooses the most fre-
quent class in the training set, and Random, which
chooses classes at random based on their frequencies
in the training set.

These are taken from the WEKA toolkit (Witten
and Frank, 2005), with the exception of SVMs, for
which we used the LibSVM implementation, naı̈ve
Bayes (since the Weka implementation does not ap-
pear to treat the value occurring with a feature as
a frequency) and Random, both of which we imple-
mented ourselves. We used WEKA’s default settings
for classifiers where appropriate.

3.3.1 Parameter search for SVMs

We used a radial-basis kernel for our SVM algo-
rithm which requires two parameters to be optimised
experimentally. This was done for each fold of cross
validation. Each fold was further divided, and three-
fold cross validation was performed for each param-
eter combination. We varied the gamma parameter
exponentially between 10−5 and 105 in multiples of
100, and varied cost between 1 and 15 in increments
of 2. We used the geometric mean of the accuracies
on the two classes to choose the best combination of
parameters; using the geometric mean enables us to
train and evaluate the SVM from either balanced or
imbalanced datasets.

3.3.2 Attribute Selection

Because of the long training time of many of
the classifiers with numbers of features, we also
looked at whether reducing the dimensionality of the
data before training by performing attribute selec-
tion would enhance or hinder performance. The at-
tribute selection was done by ranking the features
using the Chi-squared measure and taking the top
250 with the most correlation with the class. The ex-
ception to this was k-nearest neighbours, for which
we used random projections with 250 dimensions.
For the RBF network we tried both attribute selec-
tion and random projections, and naı̈ve Bayes was
run both with and without attribute selection.

validation evaluation for each dataset and feature

puted using the geometric mean of the accuracy on

validation fold; the value shown is the (arithmetic)
mean of the accuracies on the five folds, together
with an estimate of the error in this mean. The val-
ues for the held out data were computed in the same
way, dividing the data into five, allowing us to esti-
mate the error in the accuracy.

4 Discussion

4.1 Overall accuracy

The most notable difference between the two tasks,
pseudo-subjectivity and pseudo-sentiment, is that
the best classifier for the sentiment task was naı̈ve
Bayes in every case, whereas the best classifier
varies with dataset and feature set for the pseudo-
subjectivity task. This is presumably because the in-
dependence assumption on which the naı̈ve Bayes
classifier is based holds very well for the pseudo-
sentiment task, at least with our datasets.

The level of accuracy we report for the pseudo-
sentiment task is lower than that typically reported
for sentiment analysis, e.g. Pang et al. (2002), but
in line with that from other results, such as Melville
et al. (2009). This could be because favourability
is harder to determine than sentiment. For exam-
ple it may require world knowledge in addition to
linguistic knowledge, in order to determine whether
the reporting of a particular event is good news for a
company, even if reported objectively.

Accuracy on the held out dataset is up to 10%
lower than the cross-validation accuracy on the
pseudo-subjectivity task, and up to 6% lower on the
pseudo-sentiment task. This is probably due to a
change in topics over time. This degradation in per-
formance could be reduced by techniques such as
those used to improve cross-domain sentiment anal-
ysis (Li et al., 2009; Wan, 2009).

4.2 Features

Trigrams proved the most effective feature type in
3 out of the 5 different experiments, with unigrams
and entity words proving the best in 1 case each.
However, in many cases, there is not a significant
difference between the results for different datasets.

Although we only computed dependencies for

one dataset, S, we found that they did not provide
significant benefit on their own. This may be due
to the sparseness of the data, since we only ex-
tracted dependencies with respect to the organisa-
tion in question. Dependencies may be useful when
combined with other features, such as unigrams.

Attribute selection was not always effective
in improving classification, even with the high-
dimensionality of the data. In the pseudo-sentiment
task, none of the best classifiers used attribute se-
lection. In the pseudo-subjectivity task, 8 out of 13
results showed a benefit in using attribute selection.
This issue deserves further exploration, not least be-
cause reducing the number of attributes can consid-
erably speed-up the training process.

4.3 Imbalance

Finally, we look at our results considering the im-
balanced data problem. Within some of the algo-
rithms, balance is actively taken account during the
training process: e.g. naı̈ve Bayes has a weighting
on its class output to compensate for different fre-
quencies, and the SVM training process uses geo-
metric mean for computing performance, which en-
courages a good performance on imbalanced data.
In addition, we have presented results on the differ-
ence between training with balanced and unbalanced
datasets. Better results are obtained in 5 out of the
13 results for the pseudo-subjectivity task (Table 5),
and in 6 out of 9 results for the pseudo-sentiment
task (Table 6), suggesting that balancing the training
data is a useful technique in most cases.

However, a surprising result is found in Table 7,
which shows selected pseudo-subjectivity results for
dataset S with and without balanced input data. This
dataset has an approximately 70:30 imbalance in
the class distribution. Interestingly, balancing the
data shows mixed results for this dataset. In par-
ticular, the accuracy of the Bayesian network, and
sometimes the naı̈ve Bayes classifier, are severely
reduced. We found similar behaviour with dataset
C (with a 75:25 imbalance), however, as shown in
Table 8, we found the converse on dataset A (with
a 30:70 imbalance): nearly every classifier per-
formed better with balanced data. Further, Table 6
shows that balancing data has proven effective for
the naı̈ve Bayes classifiers in the pseudo-sentiment
task, where the imbalance is more severe (94:6 for

A, and 88:12 for S).
Given these results, we suggest that balancing the

training datasets is usually an effective strategy, al-
though sometimes the benefits are small if account
of balancing is also part of the parameter-selection
process for your learning algorithm.

5 Conclusion and Further Work

We have empirically analysed a range of machine-
learning techniques for developing favourability
classifiers in a commercial context. These tech-
niques include different classification algorithms,
use of attribute selection to reduce the feature sets,

and treatment of the imbalanced data problem. Also,
we used five different types of feature set to create
the datasets from the raw text. We have found a wide
variation, from less than 0.7 to over 0.9 geometric
mean of accuracy, depending on the particular set
of data analysed. We have shown how balancing
the class distribution in training data can be benefi-
cial in improving performance, but some algorithms
(i.e. naı̈ve Bayes) can be adversely affected. In fu-
ture work we will apply these techniques to larger
volumes of social media, and further explore the
questions of balancing datasets, other features and
feature selection, as well as embedding these algo-
rithms within the workflow of the company.
