Abstract

WordNet, a widely used sense inventory for
Word Sense Disambiguation(WSD), is often
too fine-grained for many Natural Language
applications because of its narrow sense dis-
tinctions. We present a semi-supervised ap-
proach to learn similarity between WordNet
synsets using a graph based recursive sim-
ilarity definition. We seed our framework
with sense similarities of all the word-sense
pairs, learnt using supervision on human-
labelled sense clusterings. Finally we discuss
our method to derive coarse sense invento-
ries at arbitrary granularities and show that the
coarse-grained sense inventory obtained sig-
nificantly boosts the disambiguation of nouns
on standard test sets.

1 Introduction

With different applications requiring different levels
of word sense granularity, producing sense clustered
inventories with the requisite level of sense granu-
larity has become important. The subtleties of sense
distinctions captured by WordNet(Miller, 1995) are
helpful for language learners (Snow et al., 2007)
and in machine translation of languages as diverse
as Chinese and English (Ng et al., 2003). On the
other hand, for tasks like Document Categorization
and Information Retrieval (Buitelaar, 2000), it may
be sufficient to know if a given word belongs to a
coarsely defined class of WordNet senses. Using
the fine grained sense inventory of WordNet may be
detrimental to the performance of these applications.
Thus developing a framework which can generate
sense inventories with different granularities can im-
prove the performance of many applications.

To generate a coarse sense inventory, many re-
searchers have focused on generating coarse senses
for each word by merging the fine-grained senses
(Chugur et al., 2002) (Navigli, 2006). This approach
has two problems. First, it requires a stopping crite-
rion for each word — for example the number of
final classes. The right number of classes for each
word cannot usually be predetermined even if the
application is known. So such systems cannot be
used to derive coarse senses for all the words. Sec-
ond, inconsistent sense clusters are obtained because
coarse senses are independently generated for each
word. This leads to transitive closure errors and sug-
gests that for deriving consistent coarse senses, in-
stead of clustering senses for each word separately
we should cluster synsets.

We propose a framework that derives a coarse
sense inventory by learning a synset similarity met-
ric. We focus on coarsening the noun synsets of
WordNet and show that the obtained coarse-grained
sense inventory greatly improves the noun sense
disambiguation. Our approach closely resembles
(Snow et al., 2007) for supervised learning of synset
similarity. But to learn similarity between synset
pairs which do not share a word we use a variant
of the SimRank framework (Jeh and Widom, 2002)
and avoid giving them zero similarity. Thus the sim-
ilarity learnt is more than a binary decision and is
reflective of a more comprehensive semantic simi-
larity between the synsets. The use of SimRank for
learning synset similarity is inspired by the success
of graph-centrality algorithms in WSD. We do not
modify the WordNet ontology, unlike (Snow et al.,
2007), as it may introduce spurious relations and re-
move some manually encoded information.

In section 2, we discuss past work in sense clus-
tering. In section 3 and 4, we describe our frame-
work of learning synset similarity using SimRank.
In section 5, we discuss our methodology of produc-
ing coarse senses using the learnt similarity metric.
Section 6 describes the experimental setup and eval-
uates the framework described. Section 7 contains
conclusions and discusses the directions for future
work.

2 Related Work

A wide variety of automatic methods have been pro-
posed for coarsening fine-grained inventories. The
earliest attempt on WordNet include (Mihalcea and
Moldovan, 2001) which merged synsets on seman-
tic principles like sharing a pertainym, antonym or
verb group. We discuss some of the ideas which
are related to our work. Though promising, many of
these techniques are severely limited by the amount
of available manually annotated data.

(Chugur et al., 2002) constructed sense similarity
matrices using translation equivalences in four lan-
guages. With the advent of WordNets being devel-
oped in multiple languages1 as well as multilingual
ontologies like BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2012), this seems a promising area.

(McCarthy, 2006) estimated sense similarities us-
ing a combination of word-to-word distributional
similarity combined with the JCN WordNet based
similarity measure (Jiang and Conrath, 1997). They
introduce a more relaxed notion of sense relatedness
which allows the user to control the granularity for
the application in hand.

(Navigli, 2006) produced a fixed set sense clusters
by mapping WordNet word senses to Oxford En-
glish Dictionary(OED) word senses exploiting sim-
ilarities in glosses and semantic relationships in the
sense inventories. It is expected that the different
WordNet senses that are semantically close mapped
to the same sense in the other ontology via an ef-
ficient mapping that is able to capture the semantic
similarity between the concepts in both the ontolo-

lic domains: http://www.globalwordnet.org/gwa/wordnet table.
html.

gies. The drawback of this method is the generation
of inconsistent sense clusters.

(Snow et al., 2007) presented a novel supervised
approach in which they train a Support Vector Ma-
chine(SVM) using features derived from WordNet
and other lexical resources, whose predictions serve
as a distance measure between synsets. Assuming
zero similarity between synset pairs with no com-
mon words, they cluster synsets using average link
agglomerative clustering and the synset similarity
model learnt.

3 SimRank

SimRank (Jeh and Widom, 2002) is a graph based
similarity measure applicable in any domain with
object-to-object relationships. It uses the intuition
that “two objects are similar if they are related to
similar objects”. Since SimRank has a recursive
structure, the base cases play an important role.

Let us denote the SimRank similarity between ob-
jects α and β by s(α, β). It is defined as 1 if α = β,
otherwise it is given by:

s(α, β) =
C

|I(α)||I(β)|

|I(α)|∑
i=1

|I(β)|∑
j=1

s(Ii(α), Ij(β))

(1)
where C ∈ (0, 1) is a constant decay factor and
I(v) is the set consisting of in-neighbours of node v,
whose individual members are referred to as Ij(v),
1 ≤ j ≤ |I(v)|.

3.1 Solution and its Properties

(Jeh and Widom, 2002) proved that a solution s(∗, ∗)
to the SimRank equations always exists and is
unique. For a graphG(V,E), the solution is reached
by iteration to a fixed-point. For each iteration k, we
keep |V |2 entries Sk(∗, ∗), where Sk(α, β) is the es-
timate of similarity between α and β at the kth iter-
ation. We start with S0(∗, ∗) which is 1 for single-
ton nodes like (x, x), 0 otherwise. We successively
compute Sk+1(∗, ∗) based on Sk(∗, ∗) using equa-
tion 1.

Regarding the convergence of the above computa-
tion process, (Lizorkin et al., 2010) proved that the
difference between the SimRank theoretical scores

12



and iterative similarity scores decreases exponen-
tially in the number of iterations and uniformly for
every pair of nodes i.e.

s(α, β)− Sk(α, β) ≤ Ck+1 ∀α, β ∈ V ; k = 0, 1, 2 . . .
(2)

3.2 Personalizing SimRank
In many scenarios we do not have complete informa-
tion about the objects and thus have similarities for
only some pairs of objects. These similarities may
be independently learnt and may not directly con-
form with the underlying graph. In such situations,
we would like to get a more complete and consis-
tent similarity metric between objects while simul-
taneously using the existing information. For this
we propose a personalized framework for SimRank
where we bias the SimRank by changing the initial-
ization. If we know similarities of some pairs, we
fix them in our set of equations and let the rest of the
values be automatically learnt by the system.

Let us call the map of node pairs to their similarity
values as InitStore. It also contains all the single-
ton nodes like (x, x) which have values equal to 1.
For other node pairs, the system of equations is the
same as equation 1. In the personalized framework,
we have no constraints on the initialization as long
as all values initialized are in the range [0, C].

3.3 Learning Synset Similarity using SimRank
The Personalized SimRank framework requires an
underlying graph G(V,E), where V is the set of
objects to be clustered and E is the set of seman-
tic links connecting these objects and an InitStore
containing the similarity values over some pairs
from V × V learnt or known otherwise. Note that
the values in the InitStore have an upper bound of
C.

For learning synset similarity, V is the set of
synsets to be clustered and E is the set of Word-
Net relations connecting these synsets. We use the
Hypernymy, Hyponymy, Meronymy and Holonymy
relations of WordNet as the semantic links. The
method for seeding the InitStore is described in
section 4 and can be summed up as follows:

• We train the SVMs from synset-merging data
from OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) to pre-

dict the similarity values of all the synset pairs
which share at least one word.

• We estimate the posterior probabilities from the
SVM predictions by approximating the poste-
rior by a sigmoid function, using the method
discussed in (Lin et al., 2003).

• We scale the posterior probabilities obtained to
range between [0, C] by linear scaling, where
C is the SimRank decay parameter.

4 Seeding SimRank with supervision

4.1 Outline
We learn semantic similarity between different
senses of a word using supervision, which allows
us to intelligently combine and weigh the different
features and thus give us an insight into how hu-
mans relate word senses. We obtain pairs of synsets
which human-annotators have labeled as “merged”
or “not merged” and describe each pair as a feature
vector. We learn a synset similarity measure by us-
ing an SVM on this extracted dataset, where positive
examples are the pairs which were merged and neg-
ative examples are the ones which were not merged
by the annotators. We then calculate the posterior
probability using the classifier score which is used
as an estimate of the similarity between synsets con-
stituting the pair.

4.2 Gold standard sense clustering dataset
Since our methodology depends upon the availabil-
ity of labelled judgements of synset relatedness, a
dataset with a high Inter-Annotator agreement is re-
quired. We use the manually labelled mappings
from the Omega ontology2 (Philpot et al., 2005)
to the WordNet senses, provided by the OntoNotes
project (Hovy et al., 2006).

The OntoNotes dataset creation involved a rigor-
ous iterative annotation process producing a coarse
sense inventory which guarantees at least 90% Inter-
Tagger agreement on the sense-tagging of the sam-
ple sentences used in the annotation process. Thus
we expect the quality of the final clustering of senses
and the derived labelled judgements to be reasonably
high.

We use OntoNotes Release 3.0 3 for extracting
WordNet sense clusters.4. The dataset consists of
senses for selected words in sense files. The senses
in OntoNotes are mapped to WordNet senses, if a
good mapping between senses exists. The steps in-
volved in extraction are as follows:

1. OntoNotes has mappings to 4 WordNet ver-
sions: 1.7, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0. We mapped all
the senses5 to WordNet 3.0.

2. Validating clusters on WN3.0:

• We removed the sense files which did not
contain all the senses of the word i.e. the
clustering was not complete.
• We removed the sense files in which the

clusters had a clash i.e. one sense be-
longed to multiple clusters.

3. We removed instances that were present in both
positive and negative examples. This situa-
tion arises because the annotators were work-
ing with word senses and there were inconsis-
tent sense clusters.

4.3 Feature Engineering
In this section, we describe the feature space con-
struction. We derive features from the structure of
WordNet and other available lexical resources. Our
features can be broadly categorized into two parts:
derived from WordNet and derived from other cor-
pora. Many of the listed features are motivated by
(Snow et al., 2007) and (Mihalcea and Moldovan,
2001).

OntoNotes-Release-3.0.pdf

4The OntoNotes groupings will be available through the
LDC at http://www.ldc.upenn.edu

5We dropped WN1.7 as there were very few senses and the
mapping from WN1.7 to WN3.0 was not easily available.

4.3.1 Features derived from WordNet
WordNet based features are further subdivided

into similarity measures and features. Among the
WordNet similarity measures, we used Path Based
Similarity Measures: WUP (Wu and Palmer, 1994),
LCH (Leacock et al., 1998); Information Content
Based Measures: RES (Resnik, 1995), JCN (Jiang
and Conrath, 1997), LIN (Lin, 1998); Gloss Based
Heuristics (variants of Lesk (Lesk, 1986)): Adapted
Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002), Adapted Lesk
Tanimoto and Adapted Lesk Tanimoto without hy-
ponyms6

Other synset and sense based features include
number of lemmas common in two synsets, SenseC-
ount: maximum polysemy degree among the lem-
mas shared by the synsets, SenseNum: number of
lemmas having maximum polysemy degree among
the lemmas shared by the synsets, whether two
synsets have the same lexicographer file, number of
common hypernyms, autohyponymy: whether the
two synsets have a hyponym-hypernym relation be-
tween them and merging heuristics by (Mihalcea
and Moldovan, 2001).7

4.3.2 Features derived from External Corpora
• eXtended WordNet Domains Project (González

et al., 2012) provides us the score of a synset
with respect to 169 hierarchically organized
domain-labels(excluding factotum label). We
obtain a representation of a synset in the do-
main label space and use cosine similarity, L1
distance and L2 distance computed over the
weight representations of the synsets as fea-
tures.

• BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012) pro-
vides us with the translation of noun word
senses in 6 languages namely: English, Ger-
man, Spanish, Catalan, Italian and French and
the mapping of noun synsets to DBpedia8 en-
tries. For features we use counts of common

6We call the lesk variants as AdapLesk, AdapLeskTani and
AdapLeskTaniNoHypo.

7We divide mergeSP1 2 into two features: The strict heuris-
tic checks whether all the hypernyms are shared or not whereas
the relaxed heuristic checks if the synsets have at least 1 com-
mon hypernym.

8http://dbpedia.org/About

14



lemmas in all 6 languages and count of com-
mon DBpedia entries.

• SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) pro-
vides us with a mapping from a synset to a triad
of three weights. The weights correspond to the
score given to a synset based on its objectivity
and subjectivity(positive and negative). We use
cosine similarity, L1 distance and L2 distance
of the weight representations of the synsets as
features.

• We use the sense clusterings produced by map-
ping WordNet senses to OED senses by the
organizers of the coarse-grained AW task in
SemEval-20079 (Navigli et al., 2007). For each
pair of synsets, we check if there are senses in
the synsets that belong to the same cluster in
the OED mapping.

4.4 Classifier and Training
We train SVMs using the features above on the
synset pairs extracted from OntoNotes, where ev-
ery synset pair is given either a “merged” or “not-
merged” label. Because of the skewed class distribu-
tion in the dataset, we randomly generated balanced
datasets (equal number of positive and negative in-
stances) and then divided them in a ratio of 7:3 for
training and testing respectively. We repeated the
process multiple number of times and report the av-
erage.

To train the SVMs we used an implementation by
(Joachims, 1998), whose java access is provided by
JNI-SVMLight 10 library. For all experiments re-
ported, we use the linear kernel with the default pa-
rameters provided by the library. 11

We scale the ranges of all the features to a com-
mon range [-1,1]. The main advantage offered by
scaling is that it prevents domination of attributes
with smaller numeric ranges by those with greater
numeric ranges. It also avoids numerical difficulties
like overflow errors caused by large attribute values.
Note that both training and testing data should be
scaled with the same parameters.

10JNI-SVMLight: http://adrem.ua.ac.be/∼tmartin/
11We also tested our system with an RBF kernel but the best

results were obtained with the linear kernel(Bhagwani, 2013)

4.5 Estimating Posterior Probabilities from
SVM Scores

For seeding SimRank, we need an estimate of the
posterior probability Pr(y = +1|x) instead of the
class label. (Platt, 1999) proposed approximating
the posterior by a sigmoid function

Pr(y = +1|x) ≈ PA,B(f(x)) ≡ 11+exp(Af(x)+B)

We use the method described in (Lin et al., 2003),
as it avoids numerical difficulties faced by (Platt,
1999).

5 Coarsening WordNet

We construct an undirected graph G(V,E) where
the vertex set V contains the synsets of WordNet and
edge set E comprises of edges obtained by thresh-
olding the similarity metric learnt using the person-
alized SimRank model (see section 3.2). On varying
the threshold, we obtain different graphs which dif-
fer in the number of edges. On these graphs, we find
connected components12, which gives us a partition
over synsets. All the senses of a word occurring in
the same component are grouped as a single coarse
sense. We call our approach Connected Components
Clustering(CCC).

For lower thresholds, we obtain denser graphs
and thus fewer connected components. This small
number of components translates into more coarser
senses. Therefore, using this threshold as a param-
eter of the system, we can control the granularity of
the coarse senses produced.

6 Experimental Setup and Evaluation

6.1 Feature Analysis

We analyze the feature space used for SVMs in two
ways. We evaluate Information Gain(IG) and Gain
Ratio(GR) functions over the features and do a fea-
ture ablation study. The former tries to capture the
discrimination ability of the feature on its own and
the latter measures how a feature corroborates with
other features in the feature space.

12a connected component of an undirected graph is a sub-
graph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by
paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the
supergraph.

15



We extracted all the features over the complete
OntoNotes dataset without any normalization and
evaluated them using IG and GR functions. We re-
port the top 7 features of both the evaluators in table
213.

report the average F-Score of both the classes ob-
served by removing that category of features from
our feature space. The SVMs are trained with fea-
tures normalized using MinMax Normalization for
this study.

Table 3: Feature Ablation Study

From tables 2 and 3, we observe that the most sig-
nificant contributors in SVM performance are Word-
Net similarity measures and domain cosine similar-
ity. The former highlights the importance of the on-
tology structure and the gloss definitions in Word-
Net. The latter stresses the fact that approximately
matching the domain of two senses is a strong cue
about whether the two senses are semantically re-
lated enough to be merged.

13Table lists only 11 features as 3 features are common in top
7 features of both the evaluators

Other notable observations are the effectiveness
of the OED feature and the low Information Gain
and Gain Ratio of multilingual features. We
also found that SentiWordNet features were non-
discriminatory as most of the noun synsets were de-
scribed as objective concepts.

6.2 Estimating Posterior Probabilities from
SVM Scores

We learn parameters A and B of the sigmoid that
transforms SVM predictions to posterior probabili-
ties (see section 4.5). Since using the same data set
that was used to train the model we want to calibrate
will introduce unwanted bias we calibrate on an in-
dependently generated random balanced subset from
OntoNotes.

The values of A and B obtained are -1.1655 and
0.0222 respectively. Using these values, the SVM
prediction of value 0 gets mapped to 0.4944.

6.3 Semi-Supervised Similarity Learning

We learn similarity models using the SimRank vari-
ant described in section 3. (Jeh and Widom, 2002)
use C = 0.8 and find that 5-6 iterations are enough.
(Lizorkin et al., 2010) suggest lower values of C or
more number of iterations. We vary the values for C
between 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 and we run all systems for
10 iterations to avoid convergence issues.

6.4 Coarsening WordNet

We assess the effect of automatic synset clustering
on the English all-words task at Senseval-3 (Snyder
and Palmer, 2004) 14. The task asked WSD systems
to select the apt sense for 2,041 content words in
running texts comprising of 351 sentences. Since
the BabelNet project provided multilingual equiva-
lences for only nouns, we focussed on nouns and
used the 890 noun instances.

We consider the three best performing WSD sys-
tems: GAMBL (Decadt et al., 2004), SenseLearner
(Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004) and Koc University
(Yuret, 2004) - and the best unsupervised system:
IRST-DDD (Strapparava et al., 2004) submitted in
the task. The answer by the system is given full

14This evaluation is similar to the evaluation used by (Nav-
igli, 2006) and (Snow et al., 2007)

credit if it belongs to the cluster of the correct an-
swer.

Observe that any clustering will only improve the
WSD performance. Therefore to assess the improve-
ment obtained because of our clustering, we calcu-
late the expected F-Score, the harmonic mean of ex-
pected precision and expected recall, for a random
clustering at the same granularity and study the im-
provement over the random clustering.

Let the word to be disambiguated have N senses,
each mapped to a unique synset. Let the clustering
of these N synsets on a particular granularity give
us k clusters C1, . . . Ck. The expectation that an in-
correctly chosen sense and the actual correct sense
would belong to same cluster is∑k

i=1|Ci|(|Ci|−1)
N(N − 1)

(3)

We experiment with C = 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8. The
SVM probability boundaries when scaled to [0, C]
for these values are 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40. To find the
threshold giving the best improvement against the
random clustering baseline, we use the search space
[C − 0.35, C]. The performance of the systems at
these thresholds for different values of C is reported
in table 4.

Commenting theoretically about the impact of C
on the performance is tough as by changing C we

are changing all the |V |2 simultaneous equations to
be solved. Empirically, we observe that across all
systems improvements over the baseline keep de-
creasing as C increases. This might be due to the
slow convergence of SimRank for higher values of
C.

Figure 1 shows that by varying thresholds the im-
provement of the Connected Components Cluster-
ing over the random clustering baseline at the same
granularity first increases and then decreases. This
behaviour is shared by both supervised and unsuper-
vised systems. Similar figures are obtained for other
values of C (0.7 and 0.8), but are omitted because of
lack of space.

Across supervised and unsupervised systems, we
observe higher improvements for unsupervised sys-
tems. This could be because the unsupervised sys-
tem was underperforming compared to the super-
vised systems in the fine grained WSD task setting.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

We presented a model for learning synset similarity
utilizing the taxonomy information and information
learnt from manually obtained sense clustering. The
framework obtained is generic and can be applied to
other parts of speech as well. For coarsening senses,
we used one of the simplest approaches to cluster
senses but the generic nature of the similarity gives
us the flexibility to use other clustering algorithms

Figure 1: Improvement in (a) average performance of best 3 Supervised Systems and (b) performance of best Unuper-
vised System in Senseval-3 using Connected Component Clustering Vs Random Clustering at the same granularity
with C = 0.6

for experimentation. We show that the clustering ob-
tained by partitioning synsets in connected compo-
nents gives us a maximum improvement of 5.78%
on supervised systems and 7.18% on an unsuper-
vised system. This encourages us to study graph
based similarity learning methods further as they al-
low us to employ available wide-coverage knowl-
edge bases.

We use the WordNet relations Hypernymy, Hy-
ponymy, Meronymy and Holonymy without any dif-
ferentiation. If we can grade the weights of the rela-
tions based on their relative importance we can ex-
pect an improvement in the system. These weights
can be obtained by annotator feedback from cogni-
tive experiments or in a task based setting. In ad-
dition to the basic WordNet relations, we can also
enrich our relation set using the Princeton WordNet
Gloss Corpus15, in which all the WordNet glosses
have been sense disambiguated. Any synset occur-
ing in the gloss of a synset is directly related to that
synset via the gloss relation. This relation helps
make the WordNet graph denser and richer by cap-
turing the notion of semantic relatedness, rather than
just the notion of semantic similarity captured by the
basic WordNet relations.
