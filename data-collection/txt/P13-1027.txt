Abstract

We present a corpus analysis of how Ital-
ian connectives are translated into LIS, the
Italian Sign Language. Since corpus re-
sources are scarce, we propose an align-
ment method between the syntactic trees
of the Italian sentence and of its LIS trans-
lation. This method, and clustering ap-
plied to its outputs, highlight the differ-
ent ways a connective can be rendered in
LIS: with a corresponding sign, by affect-
ing the location or shape of other signs, or
being omitted altogether. We translate
these findings into a computational model
that will be integrated into the pipeline of
an existing Italian-LIS rendering system.
Initial experiments to learn the four possi-
ble translations with Decision Trees give
promising results.

1 Introduction

Automatic translation between a spoken language
and a signed language gives rise to some of the
same difficulties as translation between spoken
languages, but adds unique challenges of its own.
Contrary to what one might expect, sign languages
are not artificial languages, but natural languages
that spontaneously arose within deaf communities;
although they are typically named after the region
where they are used, they are not derived from the
local spoken language and tend to bear no similar-
ity to it. Therefore, translation from any spoken
language into the signed language of that specific
region is at least as complicated as between any
pairs of unrelated languages.

The problem of automatic translation is com-
pounded by the fact that the amount of computa-
tional resources to draw on is much smaller than
is typical for major spoken languages. Moreover,
the fact that sign languages employ a different

transmission modality (gestures and expressions
instead of sounds) means that existing writing sys-
tems are not easily adaptable to them. The result-
ing lack of a shared written form does nothing to
improve the availability of sign language corpora;
bilingual corpora, which are of particular impor-
tance to a translation system, are especially rare.
In fact, various projects around the world are try-
ing to ameliorate this sad state of affairs for spe-
cific Sign Languages (Lu and Huenerfauth, 2010;
Braffort et al., 2010; Morrissey et al., 2010).

In this paper, we describe the work we per-
formed as concerns the translation of connectives
from the Italian language into LIS, the Italian Sign
Language (Lingua Italiana dei Segni). Because the
communities of signers in Italy are relatively small
and fragmented, and the language has a relatively
short history, there is far less existing research and
material to draw on than for, say, ASL (American
Sign Language) or BSL (British Sign Language).

Our work was undertaken within the purview of
the ATLAS project (Bertoldi et al., 2010; Lom-
bardo et al., 2010; Lombardo et al., 2011; Prinetto
et al., 2011; Mazzei, 2012; Ahmad et al., 2012),
which developed a full pipeline for translating Ital-
ian into LIS. ATLAS is part of a recent crop of
projects devoted to developing automatic transla-
tion from language L spoken in geographic area
G into the sign language spoken in G (Dreuw et
al., 2010; López-Ludeña et al., 2011; Almohimeed
et al., 2011; Lu and Huenerfauth, 2012). Input is
taken in the form of written Italian text, parsed,
and converted into a semantic representation of its
contents; from this semantic representation, LIS
output is produced, using a custom serialization
format called AEWLIS (which we will describe
later). This representation is then augmented with
space positioning information, and fed into a fi-
nal renderer component that performs the signs
using a virtual actor. ATLAS focused on a lim-
ited domain for which a bilingual Italian/LIS cor-

270



pus was available: weather forecasts, for which
the Italian public broadcasting corporation (RAI)
had long been producing special broadcasts with
a signed translation. This yielded a corpus of 376
LIS sentences with corresponding Italian text: this
corpus, converted into AEWLIS format, was the
main data source for the project. Still, it is a very
small corpus, hence the main project shied away
from statistical NLP techniques, relying instead on
rule-based approaches developed with the help of
a native Italian/LIS bilingual speaker; a similar ap-
proach is taken e.g. in (Almohimeed et al., 2011)
for Arabic.

1.1 Why connectives?

The main semantic-bearing elements of an Italian
sentence, such as nouns or verbs, typically have
a LIS sign as their direct translation. We focus
on a different class of elements, comprising con-
junctions and prepositions, but also some adverbs
and prepositional phrases; collectively, we refer
to them as connectives. Since they are mainly
structural elements, they are more heavily affected
by differences in the syntax and grammar of Ital-
ian and LIS (and, presumably, in those of any
spoken language and the “corresponding” SL).
Specifically, as we will see later, some connectives
are translated with a sign, some connectives are
dropped, whereas others affect the positioning of
other signs, or just their syntactic proximity.

It should be noted that our usage of the term
“connectives” is somewhat unorthodox. For ex-
ample, while prepositions can be seen as con-
nectives (Ferrari, 2008), only a few adverbs can
work as connectives. From the Italian Treebank,
we extracted all words or phrases that belonged
to a syntactic category that can be a connective
(conjunction, preposition, adverb or prepositional
phrase). We then found that we could better serve
the needs of ATLAS by running our analysis on
the entire resulting list, without filtering it by elim-
inating the entries that are not actual connectives.
In fact, semantic differences re-emerge through
our analysis: e.g., the temporal adverbs “domani”
and “dopodomani” are nearly always preserved,
as they do carry key information (especially for
weather forecasting) and are not structural ele-
ments.

In performing our analysis, we pursued a dif-
ferent path from the main project, relying entirely
on the bilingual corpus. Although the use of sta-

tistical techniques was hampered by the small size
of the corpus, at the same time it presented an in-
teresting opportunity to attack the problem from
a different angle. In this paper we describe how
we uncovered the translation distributions of the
different connectives from Italian to LIS via tree
alignment.

2 Corpus Analysis

The corpus consists of 40 weather forecasts in Ital-
ian and LIS. The Italian spoken utterance and LIS
signing were transcribed from the original videos
– one example of an Italian sentence and its LIS
equivalent are shown in Figure 1. An English
word-by-word translation is provided for the Ital-
ian sentence, followed by a more fluent transla-
tion; the LIS glosses are literally translated. Note
that as concerns LIS, this simply includes the gloss
for the corresponding sign. The 40 weather fore-
cast comprise 374 Italian sentences and 376 LIS
sentences, stored in 372 AEWLIS files. In most
cases, a file corresponds to one Italian sentence
and one corresponding LIS sentences; however,
there are 4 files where an Italian sentence is split
into two LIS sentences, and 2 files where two Ital-
ian sentences are merged into one LIS sentence.

AEWLIS is an XML-based format (see Fig-
ure 2) which represents each sign in the LIS sen-
tence as an element, in the order in which they oc-
cur in the sentence. A sign’s lemma is represented
by the Italian word with the same meaning, always
written in uppercase, and with its part of speech
(tipoAG in Figure 2); there are also IDs referenc-
ing the lemma’s position in a few dictionaries, but
these are not always present. The AEWLIS file
also stores several additional attributes, such as:
a parent reference that represents the syntax of
the LIS sentence; the syntactic role “played” by
the sign in the LIS sentence; the facial expres-
sion accompanying the gesture; the location in the
signing space (which may be an absolute location
or a reference to a previous sign’s: compare HR
(High Right) and atLemma in Figure 2). These
attributes are stored as elements grouped by type,
and reference the corresponding sign element by
its ordinal position in the sentence. The additional
attributes are not always available: morphologi-
cal variations are annotated only when they differ
from an assumed standard form of the sign, while
the syntactic structure was annotated for only 89
sentences.

2.1 Distributional statistics for connectives
The list of Italian connectives we considered was
extracted from the Italian Treebank developed
at the Institute for Computational Linguistics in
Pisa, Italy (Montemagni et al., 2003) by searching
for conjunctions, prepositions and adverbs. This
yielded a total of 777 potential connectives. Of
those, only 104 occur in our corpus. A simple
count of the occurrences of connectives in the Ital-
ian and LIS versions of the corpus yields the fol-
lowing results:

(a) 78 connectives (2068 occurrences total) only
occur in the Italian version, for example AL-
MENO (at least), CON (with), INFATTI (in-
deed), PER (for) .

(b) 8 connectives (67 occurrences total) only oc-
cur in the LIS version, for example CIRCA
(about), as in “Here I am”), PURE (also, ad-
ditionally).

(c) 25 connectives (925 occurrences total) occur
in both versions.

For the third category, we have computed the
ratio of the number of occurrences in Italian over
the number of occurrences in LIS; the ratios are
plotted in logarithmic scale in Figure 3. 0 on the
scale corresponds to an ITA/LIS ratio equal to 1;
positive numbers indicate that there are more oc-
currences in ITA, negative numbers that there are
more occurrences in LIS. We can recognize three
clusters by ratio:

(c1) 9 connectives occurring in both languages,
but mainly in Italian, for example POCO (a
little), PIÚ (more), SE (if), QUINDI (hence).

(c2) 13 connectives occurring in both languages
with similar frequency, for example SOLO
(only), POI (then), O (or), MA (but).

(c3) 3 connectives occurring in both languages,
but mainly in LIS: MENO (less), ADESSO
(now), INVECE (instead).

3 The effect of the Italian connectives on
the LIS translation

From this basic frequency analysis we can already
notice that a large number of connectives only ap-
pear in Italian, or have far more occurrences in
Italian than in LIS. This is unsurprising, consider-
ing that LIS sentences tend to be shorter than Ital-
ian sentences in terms of number of signs/words (a
fact which probably correlates with the increased
energy and time requirements intrinsic into artic-
ulating a message using one’s arms rather than
one’s tongue). However, our goal is to predict
when a connective should be dropped and when
it should be preserved. Furthermore, even if the
connective does not appear in the LIS sentence as
a directly corresponding sign, that does not mean
that its presence in the Italian sentence has no ef-
fect on the translation. We hypothesize four dif-
ferent possible realizations for a connective in the
Italian sentence:

• the connective word or phrase may map to a
corresponding connective sign;

• the connective is not present as a sign, but
may affect the morphology of the signs which
translate words syntactically adjacent to the

connective;

• the connective is not present as a sign, but
its presence may be reflected by the fact that
words connected by it map to signs which are
close to each other in the LIS syntax tree;

• the connective is dropped altogether.

The second hypothesis deserves some explana-
tion. The earliest treatments of LIS assumed that
each sign (lemma) could be treated as invariant.
Attempts to represent LIS in writing simply re-
placed each sign with a chosen Italian word (or
phrase, if necessary) with the same meaning. Al-
though this is still a useful way of representing the
basic lemma, more recent studies have noted that
LIS signs can undergo significant morphological
variations which are lost under such a scheme. The
AEWLIS format, in fact, was designed to preserve
them.

Of course, morphological variations in LIS are
not phonetic, like in a spoken language, but ges-
tural (Volterra, 1987; Romeo, 1991). For exam-
ple, the location in which a gesture is performed
may be varied, or its speed, or the facial expres-
sions that accompany it (Geraci et al., 2008). One
particularly interesting axis of morphology is the
positioning of the gesture in the signing space in
front of the signer. This space is implicitly divided
into a grid with a few different positions from left
to right and from top to bottom (see HR – High
Right, and LH – High Left, in Figure 2). Two or
more signs can then be placed in different posi-
tions in this virtual space, and by performing other
signs in the same positions the signer can express
a backreference to the previously established en-
tity at that location. One can even have a move-
ment verb where the starting and ending positions
of the gesture are positioned independently to in-
dicate the source and destination of the movement.
In other words, these morphological variations can
perform a similar function to gender and num-
ber agreement in Italian backreferences, but they
can also assume roles that in Italian would be per-
formed by prepositions, which are connectives. In
fact, as we will see later on, Italian prepositions are
never translated as signs, but are often associated
with morphological variations on related signs.

3.1 Tree Alignment
Two of our four translation hypotheses involve a
notion of distance on the syntax tree, and a no-

tion of signs corresponding to words. Therefore,
it is not sufficient to consider the LIS sentence
and the Italian sentence separately. Instead, their
syntax trees must be reconstructed and aligned.
Tree alignment in a variety of forms has been
extensively used in machine translation systems
(Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; May and Knight,
2007). As far as we know, we are the first
to attempt the usage of tree alignment to aid in
the translation between a spoken and a sign lan-
guage, partly because corpora that include sync-
tactic trees for sign language sentences hardly ex-
ist. (López-Ludeña et al., 2011) does use align-
ment techniques for translation from Spanish to
Spanish Sign Language (SSL), but it is limited to
alignment between words or phrases in Spanish,
and glosses or sequences of glosses in SSL.

We have developed a pipeline that takes in input
the corpus files, parses the Italian sentence with

an existing parser, and retrieves / builds a parse
tree for the LIS sentence. The two trees are then
aligned by exploiting the word/sign alignment. A
sample output is shown in Figure 4.

Italian sentence parsing. Since the corpus con-
tains the Italian sentences in plain, unstructured
text form, they need to be parsed. We used the
DeSR parser, a dependency parser pre-trained on a
very large Italian corpus (Attardi et al., 2007; Cia-
ramita and Attardi, 2011). This parser produced
the syntax trees and POS tagging that we used for
the Italian part of the corpus.

LIS syntax tree. One of the attributes allowed
by AEWLIS is “parent”, which points a sign to its
parent in the syntax tree, or marks it as a root (see
Figure 2). These hand-built syntax trees are avail-
able in roughly 1/4 of the AEWLIS files. Because
the size of our corpus is already limited, and be-

274



cause no tools are available to generate LIS syn-
tax trees, for the remaining 3/4 of the corpus we
fell back on a simple linear tree where each sign is
connected to its predecessor. This solution at least
maintains locality in most cases.

Word Alignment. Having obtained syntax trees
for the two sentences, we then needed to align
them. For this purpose we used the Berkeley Word
Aligner (BWA) 1 (Denero, 2007), a general tool
for aligning sentences in bilingual corpora. BWA
takes as input a series of matching sentences in
two different languages, trains multiple unsuper-
vised alignment models, and selects the optimal
result using a testing set of manual alignments.
The output is a list of aligned word indices for
each input sentence pair. On our data set, BWA
performance is as follows: Precision = 0.736364,
Recall = 0.704348, AER = 0.280000.

Integration. The result is an integrated syntax
tree representation of the Italian and LIS ver-
sions of the sentence, with arcs bridging aligned
word/sign pairs. Since some connectives consist
of multi-word phrases, the word nodes which are
part of one are merged into a super-node that in-
herits all connections to other nodes. Figure 4
shows the end result for the Italian and LIS sen-
tences in Figure 1 (the two sentences are repeated
for convenience at the bottom of Figure 4). The
rectangular boxes are words in the Italian sen-
tence, while the rounded boxes are signs in the LIS
sentence. The Italian tree has its root(s) at the bot-
tom, while the LIS tree has its root(s) at the top.
Solid arrows point from children to parent nodes
in the syntax tree. Gray-shaded boxes represent
connectives (words or signs, as indicated by the
border of the box). Bold dashed lines show word
alignment. Edges with round heads show relation-
ships where a sign has a location attribute refer-
encing another sign. Arrows with an empty tri-
angular head trace the paths described in the next
section.

3.2 Subtree alignment and path processing

At this point individual words are aligned, but that
is not sufficient. Our hypotheses on the effect of
connectives on translation requires us to align a
tree fragment surrounding the Italian connective
with the corresponding tree fragment on the LIS

1http://code.google.com/p/

side - where the connective may be missing. In ef-
fect, since we have hypothesized that the presence
of a connective can affect the translation of the two
subtrees that it connects, we would like to be able
to align each of those subtrees to its translation.
However, given the differences between the two
languages, it is not easy to give a clear definition
of this mapping - let alone to compute it.

Instead, we can take a step back to word-level
alignment. We make the observation that, if two
words belong to two different subtrees linked by a
connective, so that the path between the two words
goes through the connective, then the frontier be-
tween the LIS counterparts of those two subtrees
should also lie along the path between the signs
aligned with those two words. If the connective is
preserved in translation as a sign, we should ex-
pect to find it along that path; if it is not, its ef-
fect should still be seen along that path, either in
the form of morphological variations to the signs
along the path, or in the shortness of the path itself.

The first step, then, is to split the Italian syntax
tree by removing the connective. This yields one
subtree containing the connective’s parent node, if
any, and one subtree for each of the connective’s
children, if any. The parent subtree typically con-
tains most of the rest of the sentence, so only the
direct ancestors of the connective are considered.
Then, each pair of words belonging to different
subtrees is linked by a path that goes through the
connective in the original tree. Of these words, we
select the ones that have aligned signs, and then
we compute the path between each pair of signs
aligned to words belonging to different subtrees.
This gives us a set of paths to consider in the LIS
syntax tree.

For example, let us consider the connective “di”
between “possibilità” and “scroscio” in Figure 4.

• This node connects two subtrees: a child sub-
tree containing “qualche, breve, scroscio, di,
pioggia”, and a parent subtree containing the
rest of the sentence.

• From each subtree, a set of paths is gener-
ated: all paths extending from the connective
to the leaves of the child subtree (for exam-
ple “scroscio, qualche” or “scroscio, di, pi-
oggia”), and the path of direct ancestors in
the parent tree (“sulla, annuvolamento, pos-
sibilità”).

• Iterate through the cartesian product of each

pair of sets (in this case we have only one
pair), and consider the full path formed by the
two paths connected by the connective node
(for instance, “sulla, annuvolamento, possib-
lità, di, scroscio, breve”).

• For each of these paths, take the signs aligned
to words on different sides of the target con-
nective, and find the shortest path between
those signs in the LIS syntax tree; we call this
the aligned path. For example, from “pos-
sibilità” and “scroscio” we find “POTERE,
ACQUAZZONE”. If this process generates
multiple paths, only the maximal ones are
kept.

By looking at words within a certain distance of
the connective, at their aligned signs, and at the
distance between those signs in the aligned path,
the program then produces one or more “transla-
tion candidates” for each occurrence of a connec-
tive:

• Sign: if the connective word is aligned to a
connective sign in LIS, that is its direct trans-
lation;

• Location: if morphology variations (cur-
rently limited to the “location” attribute, see
Figure 2) are present on a sign aligned to an
It. word belonging to one of the examined
paths, and the word is less than 2 steps away
from the connective, that morphological vari-
ation in LIS may capture the function of the
connective;

• Close: if two It. words are connected by
a connective, and they map to signs which
have a very short path between them (up to
3 nodes, including the two signs), the con-
nective may be reflected simply in this close
connection between the translated subtrees in
the LIS syntax tree;

• Missing: if none of the above hypotheses are
possible, we hypothesize that the connective
has been simply dropped.

Table 1 shows the results of this analysis. It in-
cludes only connectives with more than 10 occur-
rences. For each connective and translation hy-
pothesis, the shading of the cell is proportional to

276



the fraction of occurrences where that hypothesis
is possible; this fraction is also given as a percent.
Note that Sign, Location and Close candidates are
not mutually exclusive: for instance, an occur-
rence of a connective might be directly aligned
with a sign, but at the same time it might fit the
criteria for a Location candidate. For this reason,
the sum of the percents in the four columns is not
necessarily 100.

k-means clustering (MacQueen, 1967; Lloyd,
1982) has been applied to the connectives, with
the aforementioned fractions as the features. The
resulting five clusters are represented by the row
groupings in the table.

The first cluster contains words which clearly
have a corresponding sign in LIS, such as “do-
mani” (tomorrow). “Domani” and “dopodomani”
are not actually connectives, while “mentre”, “o”
and “però” are. It is interesting to note that, while
a logician might expect “e” (and) and “o” (or) to
be treated similarly, they actually work quite dif-
ferently in LIS: there is a specific sign for “o”, but
there is no sign for “e”. Instead, signs are sim-
ply juxtaposed in LIS where “e” would be used in
Italian.

The words in the second cluster also have a di-
rect sign translation, but they are missing in the
LIS translation around half of the time. Several
words represent connections with previous state-
ments or situations, such as “ancora” (again), “in-
vece” (instead), “ma” (but). These appear to be
often dropped in LIS when they reference a previ-
ous sentence, e.g. a sentence-initial “ma”; or when
they are redundant in Italian, e.g. “ma” in “ma an-
che” (“but also”). Therefore, we think can see two
phenomena at play here: a stronger principle of
economy in LIS, and a reduced number of explicit
connections across sentences.

The third cluster is similar to the second cluster,
but with a higher percent of dropped connectives.
This is probably related to the semantics of these
five words. “Abbastanza” means “quite, enough”,
and in general indicates a medium quantity, not
particularly large nor particularly small. It is no
surprise that this word is more likely to succumb
to principles of economy in language. “Anche”
means “also”, and is either translated as “PURE”
(also) or dropped. This does not seem to depend
on the specific circumstances of its usage; rather, it
seems to be largely a stylistic choice by the trans-
lator. “Proprio” (“precisely”, “just”) has a corre-

sponding sign “PROPRIO”, but since it does not
convey essential information it is a good candidate
for dropping. “Quindi”, meaning “therefore”, has
its own sign “QUINDI”, but once again the causal
relationship it conveys is usually not essential to
understanding what the weather will be, and thus
it is frequently dropped.

The fourth cluster consists of connectives which
are largely simply dropped. Some of these are el-
ements that just contribute to the discourse flow
in Italian, such as “per quanto riguarda” (“con-
cerning”); in fact, this connective mainly oc-
curs in sentence-initial position in the Italian sen-
tences in our corpus and denotes a change of
topic from the previous sentence, corroborating
our hypothesis of a reduced use of explicit inter-
sentence connections in LIS. It may seem strange
for comparative and intensity markers such as
“più” (more) or “poco” (a little) to be so consis-
tently dropped, but it turns out that intensity varia-
tions for weather phenomena are often embedded
into a specific sign, for example “NUVOLOSITÀ
AUMENTARE” (increasing cloud cover).

The fifth cluster contains all Italian prepositions
(with 10 or more occurrences in the corpus), none
of which is translated as a sign (the 6 occurrences
for “in”, the 4 for “su” and the 2 for “di” are due
to alignment errors). We can conclude that prepo-
sitions do not exist in LIS as parts of speech; how-
ever, the prepositions in this cluster are often asso-
ciated with morphological variations in the spatial
positioning of related signs, which suggests that
the role associated with these prepositions in Ital-
ian is performed by these variations in LIS. The
conjunction “e” (and) also ends up in this cluster,
although it has 8 legitimate sign alignments with
“pure” (“too”); the rest are alignment errors. Un-
surprisingly, all connectives in this class also have
high ratings for the “close” hypothesis.

4 Rule extraction

We trained a classifier to help a LIS generator de-
termine how an Italian connective should be trans-
lated. Because the translation pipeline we plan to
integrate with is rule-based, we chose a Decision
Tree as our classifier: this allows rules to be easily
extracted from the classification model.

In order to identify a single class for each exam-
ple, we ranked the four possible translation can-
didates as follows: Sign is the strongest, then
Location, then Close, and finally Missing is the

277



child1 align = None ∩ word = Per quanto riguarda ∩ parent align = None ⇒ Missing
child1 align = None ∩ word = Per quanto riguarda ∩ parent align = PREVEDERE ⇒ Close
child1 align = None ∩ word = o ⇒ Align(O)
child1 align = None ∩ word = su ∩ child2 align mykind = location ∩ child2 align = SICILIA ⇒ Location

Figure 5: Some rules extracted from the decision tree

weakest. Then, each example is labeled with
the strongest translation candidate available for it:
thus, for example, if the connective word appears
to be translated with a connective sign, and the
words it connects are also aligned to signs which
are close to each other syntactically, then the class
is Sign, not Close.

Our training data suffers from large imbalance
between the “missing” class and the others. A
classifier that simply labels all examples as “miss-
ing” would have an accuracy above 60%, and in
fact, that is the classifier that we obtain if we at-
tempt to automatically optimize the parameters of
a Decision Tree (DT). We also note that, for con-
nectives where both options are possible, choosing
to translate them can make the sentence more ver-
bose, but choosing to drop them risks losing part of
the sentence’s meaning: the worse risk is the lat-
ter. Following accepted practice with unbalanced
datasets (Chawla et al., 2004), we rebalanced the
classes by duplicating all examples of the Align,
Location and Close classes, but not those of the
Missing class.

On our data set of connectives with at least
10 occurrences, we trained a DT using AdaBoost
(Freund and Schapire, 1997). The features include
the word neighboring the connective in the Ital-
ian syntax tree, their aligned signs if any, part of
speech tags, and semantic categories such as time
or location. The resulting tree is very large, but
we provide a few examples of the rules that can be
extracted from it in Figure 5.

Bootstrap evaluation shows our DT to have an
accuracy of 83.58% ± 1.03%. In contrast, a base-
line approach of taking the most common class for
each connective results in an accuracy of 68.70%
± 0.88%. Furthermore, the baseline classifier has
abysmal recall for the Close and Location classes
(0.00% and 0.85%, respectively), which our DT
greatly improves upon (86.73% and 75.32%).

In order to estimate the impact of the lack of
a LIS syntax tree in most of the corpus, we also
learned and evaluated a DT using only the 1/4 of
the corpus for which LIS syntax trees are avail-
able. The accuracy is 81.44% ± 2.03%, versus a

baseline of 71.55% ± 1.74%. The recall for Close
and Location is 89.22% and 73.58%, vs. 0.00%
and 3.51% for the baseline. These results are com-
parable with the those obtained on the whole cor-
pus, confirming that linear trees are a reasonable
fallback.

Both clustering and classification were per-
formed using RapidMiner 5.3. 2

5 Conclusions and Future Work

The small size of our corpus, with around 375
bilingual sentences, posed a large challenge to
the use of statistical methods; on the other hand,
having no access to a LIS speaker prevented us
from simply relying on a rule-based approach. By
combining syntax tree processing with several ma-
chine learning techniques, we were able to analyze
the corpus and detect patterns that show linguis-
tic substance. We have produced initial results in
terms of rule extraction, and we will be integrat-
ing these rules into the full Italian-LIS translation
system to produce improved translation of connec-
tives.
