Abstract

This paper describes the annotation process
and linguistic properties of the Persian syn-
tactic dependency treebank. The treebank
consists of approximately 30,000 sentences
annotated with syntactic roles in addition to
morpho-syntactic features. One of the unique
features of this treebank is that there are al-
most 4800 distinct verb lemmas in its sen-
tences making it a valuable resource for ed-
ucational goals. The treebank is constructed
with a bootstrapping approach by means of
available tagging and parsing tools and man-
ually correcting the annotations. The data is
splitted into standard train, development and
test set in the CoNLL dependency format and
is freely available to researchers.

1 Introduction1

The process of manually annotating linguistic data
from a huge amount of naturally occuring texts is a
very expensive and time consuming task. Due to the
recent success of machine learning methods and the
rapid growth of available electronic texts, language
processing tasks have been facilitated greatly. Con-
sidering the value of annotated data, a great deal of
budget has been allotted to creating such data.

Among all linguistic datasets, treebanks play an
important role in the natural language processing
tasks especially in parsing because of its applica-

Technology (SCICT), Tehran, Iran. The project is fully funded

tions in tasks such as machine translation. Depen-
dency treebanks are collections of sentences with
their corresponding dependency trees. In the last
decade, many dependency treebanks have been de-
veloped for a large number of languages. There are
at least 29 languages for which at least one depen-
dency treebank is available (Zeman et al., 2012).
Dependency trees are much more similar to the hu-
man understanding of language and can easily rep-
resent the free word-order nature of syntactic roles
in sentences (Kübler et al., 2009).

Persian is a language with about 110 million
speakers all over the world (Windfuhr, 2009), yet in
terms of the availability of teaching materials and
annotated data for text processing, it is undoubt-
edly a low-resourced language. The need for more
language teaching materials together with an ever-
increasing need for Persian-language data process-
ing has been the incentive for the inception of our
project which has defined the development of the
syntactic treebank of Persian as its ultimate aim. In
this paper, we review the process of creating the Per-
sian syntactic treebank based on dependency gram-
mar. In this treebank, approximately 30,000 sen-
tences from contemporary Persian-language texts
are manually tokenized and annotated at morpholog-
ical and syntactic levels. One valuable aspect of the
treebank is its containment of near 5000 distinct verb
lemmas in its sentences making it a good resource
for educational goals. The dataset is developed af-
ter the creation of the syntactic valency lexicon of
Persian verbs (Rasooli et al., 2011c). This treebank
is developed with a bootstrapping approach by au-
tomatically building dependency trees based on the

annotation is corrected manually.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we briefly review the challenges in Persian
language processing. In Sections 3 and 4, the de-
tails about the annotation process, linguistic and sta-
tistical information about the data and the annotator
agreement are reported. In Section 5, the conclusion
and suggestions for future research are presented.

2 Persian Language Processing Challenges

Persian is an Indo-European language that is writ-
ten in Arabic script. There are lots of problems
in its orthography such as encoding problems, hid-
den diacritics and writing standards (Kashefi et al.,
2010). A number of challenges such as the free or-

der of words, the existence of colloquial texts, the
pro-drop nature of the Persian language and its com-
plex inflections (Shamsfard, 2011) in addition to the
lack of efficient annotated linguistic data have made
the processing of Persian texts very difficult; e.g.
there are more than 100 conjugates and 2800 de-
clensions for some word forms in Persian (Rasooli
et al., 2011b), some words in the Persian language
do not have a clear word category (i.e. the lexical
category “mismatch”) (Karimi-Doostan, 2011a) and
many compound verbs (complex predicates) can be
separable (i.e. the non-verbal element may be sepa-
rated from the verbal element by one or more other
words) (Karimi-Doostan, 2011b).

After the development of the Bijankhan corpus
(Bijankhan, 2004) with the annotation of word cat-
egories, other kinds of datasets have been created
to address the need for Persian language process-
ing. Among them, a Persian parser based on link
grammar (Dehdari and Lonsdale, 2008), a compu-
tational grammar based on GPSG (Bahrani et al.,
2011), syntactic treebank based on HPSG (Ghay-
oomi, 2012) and Uppsala dependency treebank (Ser-
aji et al., 2012) are the efforts to satisfy the need for



syntactic processing in the Persian language.

3.1 Motivation

With the creation of the Virastyar spell checker soft-
ware (Kashefi et al., 2010), many open-source li-
braries were released for Persian word processing
such as POS tagging, encoding refinement, tok-
enization, etc. Regarding the need for syntactic anal-
ysis of Persian texts, we decided to prepare a valu-
able linguistic data infrastructure for Persian syn-
tax. In the first step, there was a need for choosing
from the existing theories of grammar that best suits
Persian. Among grammatical theories, we decided
to choose the dependency grammar. In dependency
grammar, syntactic relations are shown with depen-
dencies between the words. In computational de-
pendency grammar, each word has one head and the
head of the sentence is the dependent of an artificial
root word (Kübler et al., 2009). A sample depen-
dency tree is shown in Figure 1(a) for a Persian sen-
tence. Note that Persian sentences are written from
right to left.

There are several reasons for the preference of
dependency grammar to grammars such as phrase-
based structure grammars. Although in both of the
representations, one can show the syntactic analy-
sis of a sentence, dependency representation has the
power to account for the free word order of many
languages such as Turkish (Oflazer et al., 2003) and
Czech (Hajic, 1998) and also Persian. As an exam-
ple, a sample non-projective dependency tree for the
Persian language is shown in Figure 1(b). The re-
cent advances in very fast dependency parsing mod-
els (e.g. (Nivre, 2009; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012)),
has made the syntactic processing task very popular
in the recent decade.

In the Persian language, in addition to the abun-
dance of crossings of the arcs, another problem oc-
curs with compound verbs and verbs in the progres-
sive aspect: compound and progressive verbs are
multi-word expressions that may be separated de-
pending on the context. Persian compound verbs
consist of a light verb and a non-verbal element and
the non-verbal element can be a noun, an adjective
(in rare cases) or a sequence of a preposition and
a noun (Dabir-Moghaddam, 1997). In addition, the
nonverbal elements can also be inflected. The dis-
tance between the nonverbal element and the light



verb on the one hand and the possibility of the non-
verbal element being inflected on the other hand
have made the task of compound verb identification
very difficult. For example, in Bijankhan (Peykare)
corpus (Bijankhan et al., 2011), approximately 9%
of nonverbal elements of compound verbs are placed
away from the light verb for the compound verbs
with the light verb 	àXQ» /kærdæn/ (to do) (Rasooli
et al., 2011a). A group of Persian progressive verbs
are composed of two words, the first being the sim-
ple past or the simple present form derived from
the infinitive 	á�� �@X /dAStæn/ (to have) and the sec-
ond being the past continuous or the present contin-
uous form of the main verb. The first verb (an auxil-
iary) agrees with the second in number and person.
The problem is that the progressive auxiliary can be
away from the main verb. The sample trees with
compound verbs and progressive auxiliary verbs are
shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) respectively.

3.2 Representation and Dependency Relation

In this treebank, we followed the format of the
CoNLL tab-separated format for dependency pars-
ing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). In addition to
the lemma, we annotated part of speech tags (both
coarse and fine grained) and person, number and
tense-mood-aspect (only for verbs) of words in sen-
tences. The details of the part of speech tags and
other morphosyntactic features and dependency re-
lations are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
The part of speech tag set in this treebank is not
the same as that of Bijankhan (Peykare) corpus (Bi-
jankhan et al., 2011) and it is essential to convert the
tagset in Peykare corpus to the tagset in this tree-
bank, in order to use both datasets2. We also tried
to use the writing standard of the Academy of Per-
sian Language and Literature except for the cases
where for a word there were several standards all of
which were used in Persian written texts (e.g. ém��

	
'
�
@

and ék�
	
à

�
@ /PAntSe/ (whatever)).

We also prepared two representations for objects
accompanied by the accusative case marker. In the
first representation (done manually), we assume the
accusative case marker @P /rA/ as the head of the two-

2It is important to note that the conversion between the
coarse-grained POS tags is straightforward and does not need
any special effort.

word sequence object plus rA. The second represen-
tation, that is the automatic conversion of the first,
is the reverse order of the first one in which the ac-
cusative case marker is the dependent of the direct
object and the direct object is considered as the head
of the aforementioned sequence. In the first rep-
resentation, objects are much easier to find by the
parser (because of the uniqueness of the accusative
case marker in Persian and less distance of it from
the verb as its head) but it may increase the num-
ber of non-projective arcs to the syntactic tree. We
prepared both of the representations in two separate
data packs. A sample comparison between the two
structures is shown in Figure 4.

In the treebank, all words are single word forms
(without spaces). There is only one exception for
simple verb inflections where even multi-word to-
kens of simple verbs are shown as only one unit. The
reason is that for many cases such as the case of in-
flections for prefixed verbs it is more straightforward
to analyze the whole part instead of analyzing each

ored tokens, it seems more beneficial to put all mor-
phemes of the word together before parsing. Fur-
thermore, with the available Persian verb analyzer it
is very easy to first preprocess the verbs4.

4If it is needed to respect the exact format of CoNLL, spaces
between the verb tokes should be replaced by a character such as
underscore. Regarding the special fine-grained morphological
tags for the verb such as tense-mood-aspect, it is also straight-
forward to separate all of the multi-word verbs and add new
dependency relations between their words.

3.3 Annotation Process

The annotation process consists of several consecu-
tive steps. In Figure 2, a summary of the bootstrap-
ping approach in the annotation process is shown.
At first, a collection of independent sentences have

been collected randomly from the web. For the first
5000 sentences, we crawled Persian news texts and
randomly sampled the sentences. For the remain-
ing sentences, we first listed the absent verb lem-
mas in the 5000 sentences based on the verb list ex-



tracted from the valency lexicon of Persian verbs
(Rasooli et al., 2011c) and collected random sen-
tences that included the absent verb lemmas in their
words. We listed all possible inflections and per each
verb lemma, sampled at most 8 sentences from the
web. These sentences had to contain at least one
present tense, one past tense, one passive voice and
one future tense inflection unless we could not find
them and were obliged to reduce the number. The
sentences were not shortened and were kept with
their original length and words. Finally, we manu-
ally removed sentences containing colloquial words.
However, we did not remove loan words or cases of
code-switching between latin-script words and Per-
sian words in the sentences. The raw sentences were
fed to the encoding and spell checking module. Af-
ter spell correction, all sentences were tokenized and
tagged with part of speech tags. All of the word
processing steps were done using Virastyar library
(Kashefi et al., 2010). After tokenization and POS
tagging, the tokenized sentences were fed to the Per-
sian verb analyzing tool (Rasooli et al., 2011a). In
the next step, the preprocessed sentences were given
to the dependency parser. We used MST parser (Mc-
Donald et al., 2005) for parsing the sentences.

In the final step, annotators corrected the errors
of tokenization, POS tagging and parsing. In about
every one to two weeks, the parser model was up-
dated by training on the new version of the treebank.
This process lasted 9 months and the number of an-
notators increased by time to speed up the process.
In the first 6 months, we used 8 annotators and for
the next 5 months, we hired 6 more annotators to
speed up the process. The annotators and linguistic
experts consisted of 1 PhD graduate (linguistics), 4
PhD candidates (linguistics), and 9 MA graduates or
graduate students (7 linguistics, 1 Persian language
and literature and 1 computational linguistics). All
of the annotators were native Persian speakers.

After finalizing the annotation of all raw sen-
tences, we applied a rule-based potential error finder
to find the potentially erroneous sentences. The rules
were gradually collected in the process of the an-
notation by the annotators. All the potentially er-
roneous sentences were given to the annotators to
be checked for potential errors. In Section 4.1, the
statistics about the changes after the correction is
reported. One of the main reasons for the double

checking phase in the process is that based on our
manual investigations of the annotations, we found
some inevitable mistakes by annotators that could be
solved by manual rules. Mistakes such as scrolling
the drop-down list unintentionally and changing the
part of speech tag or dependency relation and mis-
takes caused by tiredness and lack of concentration
in addition to some of the changes of the linguistic
conventions in the annotation. Since all cases of de-
pendency relations in this treebank may be usually
either a left-branching relation or a right-branching
one and most of the relations are restricted to cer-
tain types of parts of speech, it is easy to capture
the potential errors in the annotations based on the
rules mentioned and to keep track of the changes
in the linguistic conventions by searching the cues
for those conventions (most of the changed conven-
tions were made to very rare relations in the syntac-
tic structure).

In (Dligach and Palmer, 2011), it is concluded
that although doubly annotated corpora are more re-
liable, annotating more sentences only once is more
beneficial; i.e. annotating each sentence only once
is less time-consuming and more cost-effective. We
annotated all the sentences only once (with an ad-
ditional checking phase) except for the 5% of the
sentences in order to estimate the quality of our lin-
guistic conventions and agreement among the anno-
tators. The statistics about the annotators agreement
is reported in Section 4.1.

4 Statistics of the Treebank

Finally, 29,982 sentences were manually annotated.
The details about the statistics is shown in Ta-
ble 4. It is worth mentioning that 39.24% of the
words in the treebank are tagged as noun, 12.62%
as verb, 11.64% as preposition and 7.39% as adjec-
tive. The most frequent dependency relations are
post-dependent (15.08%) and Ezafeh construction
(10.17%). As shown in Table 5, the number of non-
projective arcs in the second representation is a little
bit less than the first. As mentioned earlier, the main
reason is the dependencies between the direct object
and words after the accusative case marker such as
the example in Figure 4. The change percentage af-
ter the correction of the potential errors is shown in
Table 6. It seems that the rules for finding the poten-

tial errors were useful for correcting the errors.

4.1 Annotators Agreement

The statistics about the agreement among the an-
notators is shown in Table 7. We can also use the
Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to measure the quality of the
annotation based on the agreement among the anno-
tators (pr(a) in Eq. 1) and the expected agreement or
probability of chance (pr(e) in Eq. 1). If we consider
the accuracy of the parser on the raw text without
gold POS tags (approximately 75% labeled and 80%
unlabeled accuracy based on our experience during
the bootstrapping) and the POS tagger that we used
during the annotation process (approximately 94%)
as the probability of chance, we see that for all of
the tasks in Table 7, the quality of the annotaion is
more than 0.81 and is considered as almost perfect
according to (Landis and Koch, 1977).

based tools for searching in the dataset, obtaining
statistics and viewing syntactic structures graphi-
cally. We hope to report more details about the lin-
guistic aspects and the findings of the project in ad-
dition to our detailed experiments on the parsing task
in future publications. We believe that this treebank
is just the very first step to satisfy the need for Per-
sian language processing. Our future aim is to add a
semantic level to the annotation.

Acknowledgments

The project is funded by Iran Supreme Coun-
cil of Information and Communication Technology
(SCICT). We really appreciate the linguists who
helped us in annotating: Farzaneh Bakhtiary, Pari-
naz Dadras, Maryam Faal-Hamedanchi, Saeedeh
Ghadrdoost-Nakhchi, Mostafa Mahdavi, Azadeh
Mirzaei, Sahar Oulapoor, Neda Poormorteza-
Khameneh, Morteza Rezaei-Sharifabadi, Sude Re-
salatpoo, Akram Shafie, and Salimeh Zamani;
and the programmers who helped us in the pro-
cess of the development of the treebank: Seyed
Mahdi Hoseini, Alireza Noorian, Yasser Souri, and
Mohsen Hossein-Alizadeh; and also our colleagues
who helped us find linguistic sources from the
web: Azadeh Abbasi Abyaneh, Shima Zamanpoor,
Narmin Ghaderi, Houra Nouri and Seyedeh Maneli
Hashemian; and other colleagues especially Mahdi
Behniafar. We thank Nizar Habash for his support
of this paper and Weiwei Guo and three anonymous
reviewers for their useful comments on the paper.

5A comprehensive description of the syntactic relations and
morphosyntactic features is reported in the treebank official re-
port (Dadegan Research Group, 2012) in the treebank package
both in Persian and English.
