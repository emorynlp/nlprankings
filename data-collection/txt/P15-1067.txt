Abstract

Knowledge graphs are useful resources for
numerous AI applications, but they are far
from completeness. Previous work such as
TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR re-
gard a relation as translation from head en-
tity to tail entity and the CTransR achieves
state-of-the-art performance. In this pa-
per, we propose a more fine-grained model
named TransD, which is an improvement
of TransR/CTransR. In TransD, we use
two vectors to represent a named sym-
bol object (entity and relation). The first
one represents the meaning of a(n) entity
(relation), the other one is used to con-
struct mapping matrix dynamically. Com-
pared with TransR/CTransR, TransD not
only considers the diversity of relations,
but also entities. TransD has less param-
eters and has no matrix-vector multipli-
cation operations, which makes it can be
applied on large scale graphs. In Experi-
ments, we evaluate our model on two typ-
ical tasks including triplets classification
and link prediction. Evaluation results
show that our approach outperforms state-
of-the-art methods.

1 Introduction

Knowledge Graphs such as WordNet (Miller
1995), Freebase (Bollacker et al. 2008) and Yago
(Suchanek et al. 2007) have been playing a piv-
otal role in many AI applications, such as relation
extraction(RE), question answering(Q&A), etc.
They usually contain huge amounts of structured
data as the form of triplets (head entity, relation,
tail entity)(denoted as (h, r, t)), where relation
models the relationship between the two entities.
As most knowledge graphs have been built either
collaboratively or (partly) automatically, they of-
ten suffer from incompleteness. Knowledge graph

completion is to predict relations between entities
based on existing triplets in a knowledge graph. In
the past decade, much work based on symbol and
logic has been done for knowledge graph comple-
tion, but they are neither tractable nor enough con-
vergence for large scale knowledge graphs. Re-
cently, a powerful approach for this task is to en-
code every element (entities and relations) of a
knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embed-
ding vector space. These methods do reasoning
over knowledge graphs through algebraic opera-
tions (see section ”Related Work”).

Among these methods, TransE (Bordes et al.
2013) is simple and effective, and also achieves
state-of-the-art prediction performance. It learns
low-dimensional embeddings for every entity and
relation in knowledge graphs. These vector em-
beddings are denoted by the same letter in bold-
face. The basic idea is that every relation is re-
garded as translation in the embedding space. For
a golden triplet (h, r, t), the embedding h is close
to the embedding t by adding the embedding r,
that is h + r ≈ t. TransE is suitable for 1-to-1
relations, but has flaws when dealing with 1-to-
N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. TransH (Wang
et al. 2014) is proposed to solve these issues.
TransH regards a relation as a translating oper-
ation on a relation-specific hyperplane, which is
characterized by a norm vector wr and a trans-
lation vector dr. The embeddings h and t are
first projected to the hyperplane of relation r to
obtain vectors h⊥ = h − w>r hwr and t⊥ =
t − w>r twr, and then h⊥ + dr ≈ t⊥. Both
in TransE and TransH, the embeddings of enti-
ties and relations are in the same space. How-
ever, entities and relations are different types ob-
jects, it is insufficient to model them in the same
space. TransR/CTransR (Lin et al. 2015) set a
mapping matrix Mr and a vector r for every re-
lation r. In TransR, h and t are projected to the
aspects that relation r focuses on through the ma-

Figure 1: Simple illustration of TransD. Each
shape represents an entity pair appearing in a
triplet of relation r. Mrh and Mrt are mapping
matrices of h and t, respectively. hip, tip(i =
1, 2, 3), and rp are projection vectors. hi⊥ and
ti⊥(i = 1, 2, 3) are projected vectors of entities.
The projected vectors satisfy hi⊥ + r ≈ ti⊥(i =
1, 2, 3).

trix Mr and then Mrh + r ≈ Mrt. CTransR is
an extension of TransR by clustering diverse head-
tail entity pairs into groups and learning distinct
relation vectors for each group. TransR/CTransR
has significant improvements compared with pre-
vious state-of-the-art models. However, it also has
several flaws: (1) For a typical relation r, all en-
tities share the same mapping matrix Mr. How-
ever, the entities linked by a relation always con-
tains various types and attributes. For example, in
triplet (friedrich burklein, nationality, germany),
friedrich burklein and germany are typical differ-
ent types of entities. These entities should be pro-
jected in different ways; (2) The projection oper-
ation is an interactive process between an entity
and a relation, it is unreasonable that the map-
ping matrices are determined only by relations;
and (3) Matrix-vector multiplication makes it has
large amount of calculation, and when relation
number is large, it also has much more param-
eters than TransE and TransH. As the complex-
ity, TransR/CTransR is difficult to apply on large-
scale knowledge graphs.

In this paper, we propose a novel method named
TransD to model knowledge graphs. Figure 1
shows the basic idea of TransD. In TransD, we de-
fine two vectors for each entity and relation. The
first vector represents the meaning of an entity or
a relation, the other one (called projection vector)
represents the way that how to project a entity em-
bedding into a relation vector space and it will
be used to construct mapping matrices. There-
fore, every entity-relation pair has an unique map-
ping matrix. In addition, TransD has no matrix-
by-vector operations which can be replaced by

vectors operations. We evaluate TransD with the
task of triplets classification and link prediction.
The experimental results show that our method has
significant improvements compared with previous
models.

Our contributions in this paper are: (1)We pro-
pose a novel model TransD, which constructs a
dynamic mapping matrix for each entity-relation
pair by considering the diversity of entities and re-
lations simultaneously. It provides a flexible style
to project entity representations to relation vec-
tor space; (2) Compared with TransR/CTransR,
TransD has fewer parameters and has no matrix-
vector multiplication. It is easy to be applied
on large-scale knowledge graphs like TransE and
TransH; and (3) In experiments, our approach
outperforms previous models including TransE,
TransH and TransR/CTransR in link prediction
and triplets classification tasks.

2 Related Work

Before proceeding, we define our mathematical
notations. We denote a triplet by (h, r, t) and their
column vectors by bold lower case letters h, r, t;
matrices by bold upper case letters, such as M;
tensors by bold upper case letters with a hat, such
as M̂. Score function is represented by fr(h, t).
For a golden triplet (h, r, t) that corresponds to a
true fact in real world, it always get a relatively
higher score, and lower for an negative triplet.
Other notations will be described in the appropri-
ate sections.

2.1 TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR
As mentioned in Introduction section, TransE
(Bordes et al. 2013) regards the relation r as trans-
lation from h to t for a golden triplet (h, r, t).
Hence, (h+r) is close to (t) and the score function
is

fr(h, t) = −‖h + r− t‖22. (1)
TransE is only suitable for 1-to-1 relations, there
remain flaws for 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N rela-
tions.

To solve these problems, TransH (Wang et al.
2014) proposes an improved model named trans-
lation on a hyperplane. On hyperplanes of differ-
ent relations, a given entity has different represen-
tations. Similar to TransE, TransH has the score
function as follows:

fr(h, t) = −‖h⊥ + r− t⊥‖22. (2)

Nt represents the number of triplets in a knowledge graph. m is the dimension of entity embedding
space and n is the dimension of relation embedding space. d denotes the average number of clusters of a
relation. k is the number of hidden nodes of a neural network and s is the number of slice of a tensor.

In order to ensure that h⊥ and t⊥ are on the hy-
perplane of r, TransH restricts ‖wr‖ = 1.

Both TransE and TransH assume that entities
and relations are in the same vector space. But
relations and entities are different types of ob-
jects, they should not be in the same vector space.
TransR/CTransR (Lin et al. 2015) is proposed
based on the idea. TransR set a mapping matrix
Mr for each relation r to map entity embedding
into relation vector space. Its score function is:

fr(h, t) = −‖Mrh + r−Mrt‖22. (3)
where Mr ∈ Rm×n, h, t ∈ Rn and r ∈ Rm.
CTransR is an extension of TransR. As head-tail
entity pairs present various patterns in different re-
lations, CTransR clusters diverse head-tail entity
pairs into groups and sets a relation vector for each
group.

2.2 Other Models
Unstructured. Unstructured model (Bordes et al.
2012; 2014) ignores relations, only models entities
as embeddings. The score function is

fr(h, t) = −‖h− t‖22. (4)
It’s a simple case of TransE. Obviously, Unstruc-
tured model can not distinguish different relations.
Structured Embedding (SE). SE model (Bordes
et al. 2011) sets two separate matrices Mrh and
Mrt to project head and tail entities for each rela-
tion. Its score function is defined as follows:

fr(h, t) = −‖Mrhh−Mrtt‖1 (5)
Semantic Matching Energy (SME). SME model
(Bordes et al. 2012; 2014) encodes each named

symbolic object (entities and relations) as a vector.
Its score function is a neural network that captures
correlations between entities and relations via ma-
trix operations. Parameters of the neural network
are shared by all relations. SME defines two se-
mantic matching energy functions for optimiza-
tion, a linear form

gη = Mη1eη + Mη2r + bη (6)

and a bilinear form

gη = (Mη1eη)⊗ (Mη2r) + bη (7)
where η = {left, right}, eleft = h, eright = t
and ⊗ is the Hadamard product. The score func-
tion is

fr(h, t) = gleft>gright (8)

In (Bordes et al.2014), matrices of the bilinear
form are replaced by tensors.
Latent Factor Model (LFM). LFM model (Je-
natton et al. 2012; Sutskever et al. 2009) en-
codes each entity into a vector and sets a ma-
trix for every relation. It defines a score function
fr(h, t) = h>Mrt, which incorporates the inter-
action of the two entity vectors in a simple and
effecitve way.
Single Layer Model (SLM). SLM model is de-
signed as a baseline of Neural Tensor Network
(Socher et al. 2013). The model constructs a non-
linear neural network to represent the score func-
tion defined as follows.

fr(h, t) = u>r f(Mr1h + Mr2t + br) (9)

where Mr1, Mr2 and br are parameters indexed
by relation r, f() is tanh operation.

689



Neural Tensor Network (NTN). NTN model
(Socher et al. 2013) extends SLM model by con-
sidering the second-order correlations into nonlin-
ear neural networks. The score function is

fr(h, t) = u>r f(h
>Ŵrt + Mr

[
h
t

]
+ br) (10)

where Ŵr represents a 3-way tensor, Mr denotes
the weight matrix, br is the bias and f() is tanh
operation. NTN is the most expressive model so
far, but it has so many parameters that it is difficult
to scale up to large knowledge graphs.

Table 1 lists the complexity of all the above
models. The complexity (especially for time) of
TransD is much less than TransR/CTransR and is
similar to TransE and TransH. Therefore, TransD
is effective and train faster than TransR/CTransR.
Beyond these embedding models, there is other re-
lated work of modeling multi-relational data, such
as matrix factorization, recommendations, etc. In
experiments, we refer to the results of RESCAL
presented in (Lin et al. 2015) and compare with it.

3 Our Method

We first define notations. Triplets are represented
as (hi, ri, ti)(i = 1, 2, . . . , nt), where hi denotes
a head entity, ti denotes a tail entity and ri de-
notes a relation. Their embeddings are denoted by
hi, ri, ti(i = 1, 2, . . . , nt). We use ∆ to represent
golden triplets set, and use ∆

′
to denote negative

triplets set. Entities set and relations set are de-
noted by E and R, respectively. We use Im×n to
denote the identity matrix of size m× n.
3.1 Multiple Types of Entities and Relations
Considering the diversity of relations, CTransR
segments triplets of a specific relation r into
several groups and learns a vector representa-
tion for each group. However, entities also
have various types. Figure 2 shows several
kinds of head and tail entities of relation loca-
tion.location.partially containedby in FB15k. In
both TransH and TransR/CTransR, all types of en-
tities share the same mapping vectors/matrices.
However, different types of entities have differ-
ent attributes and functions, it is insufficient to let
them share the same transform parameters of a re-
lation. And for a given relation, similar entities
should have similar mapping matrices and other-
wise for dissimilar entities. Furthermore, the map-
ping process is a transaction between entities and

relations that both have various types. Therefore,
we propose a more fine-grained model TransD,
which considers different types of both entities
and relations, to encode knowledge graphs into
embedding vectors via dynamic mapping matrices
produced by projection vectors.

Figure 2: Multiple types of entities of relation lo-
cation.location.partially containedby.

3.2 TransD

Model In TransD, each named symbol object (en-
tities and relations) is represented by two vectors.
The first one captures the meaning of entity (rela-
tion), the other one is used to construct mapping
matrices. For example, given a triplet (h, r, t),
its vectors are h,hp, r, rp, t, tp, where subscript
p marks the projection vectors, h,hp, t, tp ∈ Rn
and r, rp ∈ Rm. For each triplet (h, r, t), we
set two mapping matrices Mrh,Mrt ∈ Rm×n to
project entities from entity space to relation space.
They are defined as follows:

Mrh = rph>p + Im×n (11)

Mrt = rpt>p + Im×n (12)

Therefore, the mapping matrices are determined
by both entities and relations, and this kind of
operation makes the two projection vectors inter-
act sufficiently because each element of them can
meet every entry comes from another vector. As
we initialize each mapping matrix with an identity
matrix, we add the Im×n to Mrh and Mrh. With
the mapping matrices, we define the projected vec-
tors as follows:

h⊥ = Mrhh, t⊥ = Mrtt (13)

690



Then the score function is

fr(h, t) = −‖h⊥ + r− t⊥‖22 (14)
In experiments, we enforce constrains as ‖h‖2 ≤
1, ‖t‖2 ≤ 1, ‖r‖2 ≤ 1, ‖h⊥‖2 ≤ 1 and ‖t⊥‖2 ≤
1.

Training Objective We assume that there are
nt triplets in training set and denote the ith triplet
by (hi, ri, ti)(i = 1, 2, . . . , nt). Each triplet has a
label yi to indicate the triplet is positive (yi = 1)
or negative (yi = 0). Then the golden and neg-
ative triplets are denoted by ∆ = {(hj , rj , tj) |
yj = 1} and ∆′ = {(hj , rj , tj) | yj = 0}, respec-
tively. Before training, one important trouble is
that knowledge graphs only encode positive train-
ing triplets, they do not contain negative examples.
Therefore, we obtain ∆ from knowledge graphs
and generate ∆

′
as follows: ∆

′
= {(hl, rk, tk) |

hl 6= hk ∧ yk = 1}∪ {(hk, rk, tl) | tl 6= tk ∧ yk =
1}. We also use two strategies “unif” and “bern”
described in (Wang et al. 2014) to replace the head
or tail entity.

Let us use ξ and ξ
′

to denote a golden triplet
and a corresponding negative triplet, respectively.
Then we define the following margin-based rank-
ing loss as the objective for training:

L =
∑
ξ∈∆

∑
ξ′∈∆′

[γ + fr(ξ
′
)− fr(ξ)]+ (15)

where [x]+ , max (0, x), and γ is the margin sep-
arating golden triplets and negative triplets. The
process of minimizing the above objective is car-
ried out with stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
In order to speed up the convergence and avoid
overfitting, we initiate the entity and relation em-
beddings with the results of TransE and initiate all
the transfer matrices with identity matrices.

3.3 Connections with TransE, TransH and
TransR/CTransR

TransE is a special case of TransD when the di-
mension of vectors satisfies m = n and all projec-
tion vectors are set zero.

TransH is related to TransD when we set m =
n. Under the setting, projected vectors of entities
can be rewritten as follows:

h⊥ = Mrhh = h + h>p hrp (16)

t⊥ = Mrtt = t + t>p trp (17)

Hence, when m = n, the difference between
TransD and TransH is that projection vectors are

determinded only by relations in TransH, but
TransD’s projection vectors are determinded by
both entities and relations.

As to TransR/CTransR, TransD is an improve-
ment of it. TransR/CTransR directly defines a
mapping matrix for each relation, TransD con-
sturcts two mapping matrices dynamically for
each triplet by setting a projection vector for each
entity and relation. In addition, TransD has no
matrix-vector multiplication operation which can
be replaced by vector operations. Without loss of
generality, we assume m ≥ n, the projected vec-
tors can be computed as follows:

h⊥ = Mrhh = h>p hrp +
[

h>,0>
]> (18)

t⊥ = Mrtt = t>p trp +
[

t>,0>
]> (19)

Therefore, TransD has less calculation than
TransR/CTransR, which makes it train faster and
can be applied on large-scale knowledge graphs.

4 Experiments and Results Analysis

We evaluate our apporach on two tasks: triplets
classification and link prediction. Then we show
the experiments results and some analysis of them.

4.1 Data Sets

Triplets classification and link prediction are im-
plemented on two popular knowledge graphs:
WordNet (Miller 1995) and Freebase (Bollacker
et al. 2008). WordNet is a large lexical knowledge
graph. Entities in WordNet are synonyms which
express distinct concepts. Relations in WordNet
are conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. In
this paper, we use two subsets of WordNet: WN11
(Socher et al. 2013) and WN18 (Bordes et al.
2014). Freebase is a large collaborative knowl-
edge base consists of a large number of the world
facts, such as triplets (anthony asquith, location,
london) and (nobuko otowa, profession, actor).
We also use two subsets of Freebase: FB15k (Bor-
des et al. 2014) and FB13 (Socher et al. 2013).
Table 2 lists statistics of the 4 datasets.

4.2 Triplets Classification

Triplets classification aims to judge whether a
given triplet (h, r, t) is correct or not, which is a
binary classification task. Previous work (Socher
et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2015)
had explored this task. In this paper ,we use three
datasets WN11, FB13 and FB15k to evaluate our
approach. The test sets of WN11 and FB13 pro-
vided by (Socher et al. 2013) contain golden and
negative triplets. As to FB15k, its test set only
contains correct triplets, which requires us to con-
struct negative triplets. In this parper, we construct
negative triplets following the same setting used
for FB13 (Socher et al. 2013).

For triplets classification, we set a threshold δr
for each relation r. δr is obtained by maximizing
the classification accuracies on the valid set. For a
given triplet (h, r, t), if its score is larger than δr,
it will be classified as positive, otherwise negative.

We compare our model with several previous
embedding models presented in Related Work sec-
tion. As we construct negative triplets for FB15k
by ourselves, we use the codes of TransE, TransH
and TransR/CTransR provied by (Lin et al. 2015)
to evaluate the datasets instead of reporting the re-
sults of (Wang et al.2014; Lin et al. 2015) directly.

In this experiment, we optimize the objective
with ADADELTA SGD (Zeiler 2012). We select
the margin γ among {1, 2, 5, 10}, the dimen-
sion of entity vectors m and the dimension of re-
lation vectors n among {20, 50, 80, 100}, and
the mini-batch size B among {100, 200, 1000,
4800}. The best configuration obtained by valid
set are:γ = 1,m, n = 100, B = 1000 and tak-
ing L2 as dissimilarity on WN11; γ = 1,m, n =
100, B = 200 and taking L2 as dissimilarity on
FB13; γ = 2,m, n = 100, B = 4800 and tak-
ing L1 as dissimilarity on FB15k. For all the
three datasets, We traverse to training for 1000
rounds. As described in Related Work section,
TransD trains much faster than TransR (On our
PC, TransR needs 70 seconds and TransD merely
spends 24 seconds a round on FB15k).

Table 3 shows the evaluation results of triplets
classification. On WN11, we found that there are
570 entities appearing in valid and test sets but
not appearing in train set, we call them ”NULL
Entity”. In valid and test sets, there are 1680
(6.4%) triplets containing ”NULL Entity”. In
NTN(+E), these entity embeddings can be ob-
tained by word embedding. In TransD, how-

ever, they are only initialized randomly. There-
fore, it is not fair for TransD, but we also achieve
the accuracy 86.4% which is higher than that of
NTN(+E) (86.2%). From Table 3, we can con-
clude that: (1) On WN11, TransD outperforms any
other previous models including TransE, TransH
and TransR/CTransR, especially NTN(+E); (2)
On FB13, the classification accuracy of TransD
achieves 89.1%, which is significantly higher than
that of TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR and
is near to the performance of NTN(+E) (90.0%);
and (3) Under most circumstances, the ”bern”
sampling method works better than ”unif”.

Figure 3 shows the prediction accuracy of dif-
ferent relations. On the three datasets, different
relations have different prediction accuracy: some
are higher and the others are lower. Here we fo-
cus on the relations which have lower accuracy.
On WN11, the relation similar to obtains accuracy
51%, which is near to random prediction accuracy.
In the view of intuition, similar to can be inferred
from other information. However, the number of
entity pairs linked by relation similar to is only
1672, which accounts for 1.5% in all train data,
and prediction of the relation needs much infor-
mation about entities. Therefore, the insufficient
of train data is the main cause. On FB13, the
accuracies of relations cuase of death and gender
are lower than that of other relations because they

represent a relation, in which the red triangles represent the relations whose accuracies of “bern” or
“unif” are lower than 50% and the blacks are higher than 50%. The red line represents the function

names information useless for gender. On FB15k,
accuracies of some relations are lower than 50%,
for which some are lack of train data and some are
difficult to infer. Hence, the ability of reasoning
new facts based on knowledge graphs is under a
certain limitation, and a complementary approach
is to extract facts from plain texts.

4.3 Link Prediction

Link prediction is to predict the missing h or t for
a golden triplet (h, r, t). In this task, we remove
the head or tail entity and then replace it with all
the entities in dictionary in turn for each triplet in
test set. We first compute scores of those corrupted
triplets and then rank them by descending order;
the rank of the correct entity is finally stored. The
task emphasizes the rank of the correct entity in-
stead of only finding the best one entity. Simi-
lar to (Bordes et al. 2013), we report two mea-
sures as our evaluation metrics: the average rank
of all correct entites (Mean Rank) and the propor-
tion of correct entities ranked in top 10 (Hits@10).
A lower Mean Rank and a higher Hits@10 should
be achieved by a good embedding model. We call
the evaluation setting ”Raw’. Noting the fact that
a corrupted triplet may also exist in knowledge
graphs, the corrupted triplet should be regard as
a correct triplet. Hence, we should remove the
corrupted triplets included in train, valid and test
sets before ranking. We call this evaluation setting
”Filter”. In this paper, we will report evaluation
results of the two settings .

In this task, we use two datasets: WN18 and
FB15k. As all the data sets are the same, we
refer to their experimental results in this paper.
On WN18, we also use ADADELTA SGD (Zeiler

2012) for optimization. We select the margin γ
among {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2}, the dimension of entity
vectors m and the dimension of relation vectors n
among {20, 50, 80, 100}, and the mini-batch size
B among {100, 200, 1000, 1400}. The best con-
figuration obtained by valid set are:γ = 1,m, n =
50, B = 200 and taking L2 as dissimilarity. For
both the two datasets, We traverse to training for
1000 rounds.

Experimental results on both WN18 and FB15k
are shown in Table 4. From Table 4, we can
conclude that: (1) TransD outperforms other
baseline embedding models (TransE, TransH and
TransR/CTransR), especially on sparse dataset,
i.e., FB15k; (2) Compared with CTransR, TransD
is a more fine-grained model which considers the
multiple types of entities and relations simultane-
ously, and it achieves a better performance. It in-
dicates that TransD handles complicated internal
correlations of entities and relations in knowledge
graphs better than CTransR; (3) The “bern” sam-
pling trick can reduce false negative labels than
“unif”.

For the comparison of Hits@10 of different
kinds of relations, Table 5 shows the detailed
results by mapping properties of relations1 on
FB15k. From Table 5, we can see that TransD
outperforms TransE, TransH and TransR/CTransR
significantly in both “unif” and “bern” settings.
TransD achieves better performance than CTransR
in all types of relations (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-1 and
N-to-N). For N-to-N relations in predicting both
head and tail, our approach improves the Hits@10
by almost 7.4% than CTransR. In particular, for

Table 5: Experimental results on FB15K by mapping properities of relations (%).

N-to-1 relations (predicting head) and 1-to-N rela-
tions (predicting tail), TransD improves the accu-
racy by 9.0% and 14.7% compared with previous
state-of-the-art results, respectively. Therefore,
the diversity of entities and relations in knowl-
edge grahps is an important factor and the dynamic
mapping matrix is suitable for modeling knowl-
edge graphs.

5 Properties of Projection Vectors

As mentioned in Section ”Introduction”, TransD
is based on the motivation that each mapping ma-
trix is determined by entity-relation pair dynam-
ically. These mapping matrices are constructed
with projection vectors of entities and relations.
Here, we analysis the properties of projection vec-
tors. We seek the similar objects (entities and rela-
tions) for a given object (entities and relations) by
projection vectors. As WN18 has the most enti-
ties (40,943 entities which contains various types
of words. FB13 also has many entities, but the

most are person’s names) and FB15k has the most
relations (1,345 relations), we show the similarity
of projection vectors on them. Table 6 and 7 show
that the same category objects have similar projec-
tion vectors. The similarity of projection vectors
of different types of entities and relations indicates
the rationality of our method.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

We introduced a model TransD that embed knowl-
edge graphs into continues vector space for their
completion. TransD has less complexity and more
flexibility than TransR/CTransR. When learning
embeddings of named symbol objects (entities or
relations), TransD considers the diversity of them
both. Extensive experiments show that TransD
outperforms TrasnE, TransH and TransR/CTransR
on two tasks including triplets classification and
link prediction.

As shown in Triplets Classification section, not
all new facts can be deduced from the exist-

ing triplets in knowledge graphs, such as rela-
tions gender, place of place, parents and chil-
dren. These relations are difficult to infer from all
other information, but they are also useful resource
for practical applications and incomplete, i.e. the
place of birth attribute is missing for 71% of all
people included in FreeBase (Nickel, et al. 2015).
One possible way to obtain these new triplets is
to extract facts from plain texts. We will seek
methods to complete knowledge graphs with new
triplets whose entities and relations come from
plain texts.
