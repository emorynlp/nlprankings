Abstract

We use a set of enriched n-gram models to track

grammaticality judgements for different sorts of

passive sentences in English. We construct these

models by specifying scoring functions to map the

log probabilities (logprobs) of an n-gram model for

a test set of sentences onto scores which depend

on properties of the string related to the parame-

ters of the model. We test our models on classifica-

tion tasks for different kinds of passive sentences.

Our experiments indicate that our n-gram models

achieve high accuracy in identifying ill-formed pas-

sives in which ill-formedness depends on local rela-

tions within the n-gram frame, but they are far less

successful in detecting non-local relations that pro-

duce unacceptability in other types of passive con-

struction. We take these results to indicate some of

the strengths and the limitations of word and lexical

class n-gram models as candidate representations of

speakers’ grammatical knowledge.

1 Introduction

Most advocates (Pereira, 2000; Bod et al., 2003)
and critics (Chomsky, 1957; Fong et al., 2013) of a
probabilistic view of grammatical knowledge have
assumed that this view identifies the grammatical
status of a sentence directly with the probability of
its occurrence. By contrast, we seek to character-
ize grammatical knowledge statistically, but with-
out reducing grammaticality directly to probabil-
ity. Instead we specify a set of scoring procedures
for mapping the logprob value of a sentence into
a relative grammaticality score, on the basis of the
properties of the sentence and of the logprobs that
an n-gram word model generates for the corpus
containing the sentence. A scoring procedure in
this set generates scores in terms of which we con-
struct a grammaticality classifier, using a param-
eterized standard deviation from the mean value.
The classifier provides a procedure for testing the

accuracy of different scoring criteria in separat-
ing grammatical from ungrammatical passive sen-
tences.

We evaluate this approach by applying it to
the task of distinguishing well and ill-formed sen-
tences with passive constructions headed by four
different sorts of verbs: intransitives (appear,
last), pseudo-transitives, which take a restricted
set of notional objects (laugh a hearty laugh,
weigh 10 kg), ambiguous transitives, which allow
both agentive and thematic subjects (the jeans /
the tailor fitted John), and robust transitives that
passivize freely (write, move). Intransitives and
pseudo-transitives generally yield ill-formed pas-
sives. Passives formed from ambiguous transitives
tend to be well-formed only on the agentive read-
ing. Robust transitives, for the most part, yield
acceptable passives, even if they are semantically
(or pragmatically) odd.

Experimenting with several scoring procedures
and alternative values for our standard deviation
parameter, we found that our classifier can distin-
guish pairwise between elements of the first two
classes of passives and those of the latter two with
a high degree of accuracy. However, its perfor-
mance is far less reliable in identifying the differ-
ence between ambiguous and robust transitive pas-
sives. The first classification task relies on local
lexical patterns that can be picked up by n-gram
models, while the second requires identification of
anomalous relations between passivized verbs and
by-phrases, which are not generally accessible to
measurement within the range of an n-gram.

We also observed that as we increased the size
of the training corpus, the performance of our en-
riched models on the classification task also in-
creased. This result suggests that better n-gram
language models are more sensitive to the sorts of
patterns that our scoring procedures rely on to gen-
erate accurate grammaticality classifications.

We note the important difference between

28



grammaticality and acceptability. Following stan-
dard assumptions, we take grammaticality to be
a theoretical notion, and acceptability to be an
empirically testable property. Acceptability is, in
part, determined by grammaticality, but also by
factors such as sentence length, processing limi-
tations, semantic acceptability and many other el-
ements. Teasing apart these two concepts, and ex-
plicating their precise relationship raises a host of
subtle methodological issues that we will not ad-
dress here. Oversimplifying somewhat, we are try-
ing to reconstruct a gradient notion of grammati-
cality which is derived from probabilistic models,
that can serve as a core component of a full model
of acceptability.

We distinguish our task from the standard task
of error detection in NLP (e.g. Post (2011)),
that can be used in various language processing
systems, such as machine translation (Pauls and
Klein, 2012), language modeling and so on. In
error detection, the problem is a supervised learn-
ing task. Given a corpus of examples labeled as
grammatical or ungrammatical, the problem is to
learn a classifier to distinguish them. We use su-
pervised learning as well, but only to measure the
upper bound of an unsupervised learning method.
We assume that native speakers do not, in general,
have access to systematic sets of ungrammatical
sentences that they can use to calibrate their judge-
ment of acceptability. Rather ungrammatical sen-
tences are unusual or unlikely. However, we use
some ungrammatical sentences to set an optimal
threshold for our scoring procedures.

2 Enriched N-Gram Language Models

We assume that we have some high quality lan-
guage model which defines a probability distri-
bution over whole sentences. As has often been
noted, it is not possible to reduce grammatical-
ity directly to a probability of this type, for sev-
eral reasons. First, if one merely specifies a fixed
probability value as a threshold for grammatical-
ity, where strings are deemed to be grammatical
if and only if their probability is higher than the
threshold, then one is committed to the existence
of only a finite number of grammatical sentences.
The probabilities of the possible strings of words
in a language sum to 1, and so at most 1/� sen-
tences can have a probability of at least �. Second,
probability can be affected by factors that do not
influence grammaticality. For example, the word

’yak’ is rarer (and therefore less probable) than the
word ’horse’, but this does not affect the relative
grammaticality of ’I saw a horse’ versus ’I saw a
yak’. Third, a short ungrammatical sentence may
have a higher probability than a long grammatical
sentence with many rare words.

In spite of these arguments against a naive re-
duction of grammaticality, probabilistic inference
does play a role in linguistic judgements, as in-
dicated by the fact that they are often gradient.
Probabilistic inference is pervasive throughout all
domains of cognition (Chater et al., 2006), and
therefore it is plausible to assume that knowledge
of language is also probabilistic in nature. More-
over language models do seem to play a crucial
role in speech recognition and sentence process-
ing. Without them we would not be able to under-
stand speech in a noisy environment.

We propose to accommodate these different
considerations by using a scoring function to map
probabilities to grammaticality rankings. This
function does not apply directly to probabilities,
but rather to the parameters of the language model.
The probability of a particular sentence with re-
spect to a log-linear language model will be the
product of certain parameters: in log space, the
sum. We define scores that operate on this collec-
tion of parameters.

2.1 Scores

We have experimented with scores of two differ-
ent types that correlate with the grammaticality
of a sentence. Those of the first type are dif-
ferent implementations of the idea of normaliz-
ing the logprob assigned by an n-gram model to
a string by eliminating the significance of factors
that do not influence the grammatical status of a
sentence, such as sentence length and word fre-
quency. Scores of the second type are based on the
intuition that the (un)grammaticality of a sentence
is largely determined by its problematic compo-
nents. These scores are functions of the lowest
scoring n-grams in the sentence.

Mean logprob (ML) This score is the logprob
of the entire sentence divided by the length of the
sentence, or equivalently the mean of the logprobs
for the single trigrams:
ML = 1n logPTRIGRAM(〈w1, . . . , wn〉)
By normalizing the logprob for the entire sentence
by its length we eliminate the effect of sentence
length on the acceptability score.

29



Weighted mean logprob (WML) This score is
calculated by dividing the logprob of the entire
sentence by the sum of the unigram probabilities
of the lexical items that compose the sentence:
WML = log PTRIGRAM(〈w1,...,wn〉)log PUNIGRAM(〈w1,...,wn〉)
This score eliminates at the same time the effect of
the length of the sentence and the lower probabil-
ity assigned to sentences with rare lexical items.

Synctactic log odds ratio (SLOR) This score
was first used by Pauls and Klein (2012) and
performs a normalization very similar to WML
(we will see below that in fact the two scores are
basically equivalent):
SLOR =
log PTRIGRAM(〈w1,...,wn〉)−log PUNIGRAM(〈w1,...,wn〉)

n

Minimum (Min) This score is equal to the low-
est logprob assigned by the model to the n-grams
of the sentence divided by the unigram logprob of
the lexical item heading the n-gram:
Min = mini

[
log P (wi|wi−2wi−1)

log P (wi)

]
In this way, if a single n-gram is assigned a low
probability (normalized for the frequency of its
head lexical item), then this low score is in some
sense propagated to the whole sentence.

Mean of the first quartile (MFQ) This score
is a generalization of the Min score. We order
the single n-gram logprobs from the lowest to the
highest, and we consider the first (lowest) quar-
tile. We then normalize the logprobs for these n-
grams by the unigram probability of the head lex-
ical item, and we take the mean of these scores.
In this way we obtain a score that is more robust
than the simple Min, as, in general, a grammatical
anomaly influences the logprob of more than one
n-gram.

2.2 N-Gram Models
We are using n-gram models on the understand-
ing that they are fundamentally inadequate for de-
scribing natural languages in their full syntactic
complexity. In spite of their limitations, they are a
good starting point, as they perform well as lan-
guage models across a wide range of language
modeling tasks. They are easy to train, as they
do not require annotated training data.

We do not expect that our n-gram based gram-
maticality scores will be able to idenitfy all of the
cases of ungrammaticality that we encounter. Our
working hyposthesis is that they can capture cases

of ill-formedness that depend on local factors, that
can be identified within n-gram frames, as op-
posed to those which involve non-local relations.
If these models can detect local grammaticality vi-
olations, then we will have a basis for thinking
that richer, more structured language models can
recognize non-local as well as local sources of un-
grammaticality.

3 Experiments with Passives

Rather than trying to test the performance of these
models over all types of ungrammaticality, we
limit ourselves to a case study of the passive. By
tightly controlling the verb types and grammat-
ical construction to which we apply our models
we are better able to study the power and the lim-
its of these models as candidate representations of
grammatical knowledge.

3.1 Types of Passives

Our controlled experiments on passives are, in
part, inspired by speakers’ judgments discussed in
Ambridge et al. (2008). Their experimental work
measures the acceptability of various passive sen-
tences.

The active-passive alternation in English is ex-
emplified by the pair of sentences

• John broke the window.

• The window was broken by John.

The acceptability of the passive sentence de-
pends largely on lexical properties of the verb.
Some verbs do not allow the formation of the pas-
sive, as in the case of pure intransitive verbs like
appear, discussed below, which permit neither the
active transitive, nor the passive.

We conducted some prelimiary experiments,
not reported here, on modelling the data on pas-
sives from recent work in progress that Ben Am-
bridge and his colleagues are doing, and which
he was kind enough to make available to us. We
observed that the scores we obtained for our lan-
guage models did not fully track these judgements,
but we did notice that we obtained much better
correlation at the low end of the judgment distri-
bution. In Ambridge’s current data this judgement
range corresponds to passives constructed with in-
transitive verbs.

The Ambridge data indicates that the capacity
of verbs to yield well-formed passive verb phrases

30



forms a continuum. Studying the judgement pat-
terns in this data we identified four reasonably
salient points along this hierarchial continuum.

First, at the low end, we have intransitives
like appear: (*John appeared the book. *The
book was appeared). Next we have what may be
described as pseudo-transitives verbs like laugh,
which permit only notional NP objects and do not
easily passivize (Mary laughed a hearty laugh/*a
joke. ?A hearty laugh/*A joke was laughed by
Mary) above them. These are followed by cases
of ambiguous transitives like fit, which, in active
form, carry two distinct readings that correspond
to an agentive and a thematic subject, respectively.

• The tailor fitted John for a new suit.

• The jeans fitted John

Only the agentive reading can be passivized.

• John was fitted by the tailor.

• *John was fitted by the jeans.

Finally, the most easily passivized verbs are ro-
bust transitives, which take the widest selection of
NP subjects in passive form (John wrote the book.
The book was written by John).

This continuum causes well-formedness in pas-
sivization to be a gradient property, as the Am-
bridge data illustrates. Passives tend to be more
or less acceptable along this spectrum. The gradi-
ence of acceptability for passives implies the par-
tial overlap of the score distributions for the differ-
ent types of passives that our experiments show.

The experiments were designed to test our hy-
pothesis that n-gram based language models are
capable of detecting ungrammatical patterns only
in cases where they do not depend on relations
between words that cross the n-word boundary
applied in training. Therefore we expect such a
model to be capable of detecting the ungrammati-
cality of a sentence like A horrible death was died
by John, because the trigrams death was died, was
died by and died by John are unlikely to appear
in any corpus of English. On the other hand, we
do not expect a trigram model to store the infor-
mation necessary to identify the relative anomaly
of a sentence like Two hundred people were held
by the theater, because all the trigrams (as well as
the bigrams and the unigrams) that constitute the
sentence are likely to appear with reasonable fre-
quency in a large corpus of English.

The experiments generalize this observation
and test the performance of n-gram models on a
wider range of verb types. To quantify the per-
formance of the different models we derive simple
classifiers using the scores we have defined and
testing them in a binary classification task. This
task measures the ability of the classifier to dis-
tinguish between grammatical sentences, and sen-
tences containing different types of grammatical
errors.

The models are trained in an unsupervised man-
ner using only corpus data, which we assume to be
uniformly grammatical. In order to evaluate the
scoring methods, we use some supervised data to
set the optimal value of a simple threshold. This is
not however a supervised classification task: we
want to see how well the scores could be used
to separate grammatical and ungrammatical data,
and though unorthodox, this seems a more direct
way of measuring this conditional property than
stipulating some fixed threshold.

3.2 Training data

We used the British National Corpus (BNC) (BNC
Consortium, 2007) to obtain our training data. We
trained six different language models, using six
different subcorpora of the BNC. The first model
used the entire collection of written texts anno-
tated in the BNC, for a total of approximately 100
million words. The other models were trained on
increasingly smaller portions of the written texts
collection: 40 million words, 30 million words, 15
million words, 7.6 million words, and 3.8 million
words. We constructed these corpora by randomly
sampling an appropriate number of complete sen-
tences.

All models were trained on word sequences.
For smoothing the n-gram probability distribu-
tions we used Kneser-Ney interpolation, as de-
scribed in Goodman (2001).

3.3 Test data

We constructed the test data for our hypothesis in
a controlled fashion. We first compiled a list of
verbs for each of the four verb types that we con-
sider (intransitives, pseudo-transitives, ambiguous
transitives, and robust transitives). We selected
verbs from the BNC that appeared at least 100
times in their past participle form in the entire cor-
pus in order to ensure a sufficient number of pas-

31



sive uses in the training data.1 We selected 40 in-
transitive verbs, 13 pseudo transitives, 23 ambigu-
ous transitives and 40 transitive verbs. To clas-
sify the verbs we relied on our intuitions as native
speakers of English.

Using these lists we automatically generated
four corpora by selecting an agent and a patient
from a predefined pool of NPs, randomly select-
ing a determiner (if necessary) and a number (if
the NP allows plurals). The resulting corpora are
of the following sizes:

• intransitive verbs – 24480 words, 3240 sen-
tences,

• pseudo transitive verbs – 7956 words, 1053
sentences,

• ambiguous transitive verbs – 14076 words,
1863 sentences,

• robust transitive verbs – 24480 words, 3240
sentences.

Each corpus was evaluated by the six models.
We computed our derived scores for each sentence
on the basis of the logprobs that the language mod-
els assigns.

3.4 Binary classifiers

For each model and for each score we constructed
a set of simple binary classifiers on the basis of
the results obtained for the transitive verb corpus.
We took the mean of each score assigned by the
model to the transitive sentences, and we set dif-
ferent thresholds by subtracting from this value
a number of standard deviations ranging from 0
to 2.75. The rationale behind these classifiers is
that, assuming the passives of the robust transi-
tives to be grammatical, the scores for the other
cases should be comparatively lower. Therefore
by setting a threshold “to the left” of the mean we
should be able to distinguish between grammati-
cal sentences, whose score is to the right of the
threshold, and ungrammatical ones, expected to a
have a score lower than the threshold. Formally
the classifier is defined as follows:

cs(w) =

{
+ if s(w) ≥ m− S · σ
− otherwise

(1)

1Notice that in most cases the past participle form is the
same as the simple past form, and for this reason we set the
threshold to such a high value.

where s is one of our scores, w is the sentence to
be classified, s(w) represents the value assigned
by the score to sentence w, m is the mean for
the score in the transitive condition, σ is the stan-
dard deviation for the score again in the transitive
condition, and S is a factor by which we move
the threshold away from the mean. The classi-
fier assigns the grammatical (+) tag only to those
sentences that are assigned values higher than the
threshold m− S · σ.

Alternatively in terms of the widely used z-
score, defined as zs(w) = (s(w) −m)/σ we can
say that w is classified as grammatical iff zs(w) ≥
−S.

4 Results

For reasons of space we will limit the presenta-
tion of our detailed results to the 100 million word
model, as it offers the sharpest effects. We will,
however, also report comparisons on the most im-
portant metrics for the complete set of models.

In Figure 1 we show the distribution of the five
scores for the four different corpora (transitive,
ambiguous, pseudo, and intransitive) obtained us-
ing the 100 million word model. In all cases we
observe the same general pattern: the sentences in
the corpus generated with robust transitives are as-
signed comparatively high scores, and these grad-
ually decrease when we consider the ambiguous,
the pseudo and the intransitive conditions. Inter-
estingly, this order reflects the degree of “transi-
tivity” that these verb types exhibit. Notice, how-
ever, that the four conditions seem to group into
two different macro-distributions. On the right
we have the transitive-ambiguous sentences and
on the left the pseudo-intransitive cases. This par-
tially confirms our hypothesis that n-gram mod-
els have problems recognizing lexical dependen-
cies that determine the felicitousness of passives
constructed using ambiguous transitive verbs, as
these are, for the most part, non-local. Neverthe-
less, it is important to note that the overlap of the
distributions for these two cases is also due to the
fact that many cases in the ambiguous transitive
corpus are indeed grammatical.

Figure 2 summarizes the (balanced) accuracies
obtained by our classifiers for each comparison,
by each model. These results confirm our hy-
pothesis that the classifiers tend to perform better
when distinguishing passive sentences constructed
with a robust transitive verbs from those headed by

pseudo-transitives and intransitives.

In the comparison between transitive and am-
biguous transitive sentences, the classifiers are
“stuck” at around 60% accuracy. Using larger
training corpora produces only a marginal im-
provement. This contrasts with what we observe
for the transitive/pseudo and transitive/intransitive
classification tasks. In the transitive/pseudo task,
we already obtain reasonable accuracy with the
model trained with the smallest BNC subset.
Oddly, the overall best result is achieved with 30
million words, although the result obtained with
the model trained on the full BNC corpus is not
much lower. For the transitive/intransitive classifi-
cation task we observe a much steadier and larger
growth in accuracy, reaching the overall best result
of 85.1%. Table 1 reports the best results for each
comparison by each language model. For each
condition we report the best accuracy obtained, the
corresponding F1 score, the score that achieves the
best result, and the best accuracy obtained by just
using the logprobs. These results are obtained us-

ing different values for the S parameter. However,
in general the best results are obtained when the S
parameter is set to a value in the interval [0.5, 1.5].

In comparing the performance of the individ-
ual scores, we first notice that, while for the tran-
sitive/ambiguous comparison all scores perform
pretty much at the same level, there is a clear hier-
archy between scores for the other comparisons.

We observe that the baseline raw logprob as-
signed by the n-grams models performs much
worse than the scores, resulting in roughly 10%
less accuracy than the best performing score in ev-
ery condition. ML performs slightly better, obtain-
ing around 5% greater accuracy than logprob as a
predictor. This shows that even though the length
of the sentences in our test data is relatively con-
stant (between 9 and 11 words), there is still an
improvement if we take this structural factor into
account. The two scores WML and SLOR display
the same pattern, showing that they are effectively
equivalent. This is not surprising given that they
are designed to modify the raw logprob by tak-

ing into account exactly the same factors (length
of the sentence and frequency of the unigrams that
compose the sentence). These two scores perform
generally better in the transitive/ambiguous com-
parison, and they achieve good performance when
the size of the training model is small. However,
for the most part, the two scores derived from the
logprobs of the least probable n-grams in the sen-
tence, Min and MFQ, get the best results. Min
exhibits erratic behavior (mainly due to its non-
normal distribution for each condition, as shown

in figure 1), and it seems to be more stable only
in the presence of a large training set. MFQ has
a much more robust contour, as it is significantly
less dependent on the choice of S.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In Clark and Lappin (2011) we propose a model
of negative evidence that uses probability of oc-
currence in primary linguistic data as the basis for
estimating non-grammaticality through relatively

low frequency in a sample of this data. Here we
follow Clark et al. (2013) in effectively inverting
this strategy.

We identify a set of scoring functions based on
parameters of probabilistic models that we use to
define a grammaticality threshold, which we use
to classify strings as grammatical or ill-formed.
This model offers a stochastic characterisation of
grammaticality without reducing grammaticality
to probability.

We expect enriched lexical n-gram models of
the kind that we use here to be capable of rec-
ognizing the distinction between grammatical and
ungrammatical sentences when it depends on local
factors within the frame of the n-grams on which
they are trained. We further expect them not to be
able to identify this distinction when it depends on
non-local relations that fall outside of the n-gram
frame.

It might be thought that this hypothesis con-
cerning the capacities and limitations of n-gram
models is too obvious to require experimental sup-
port. In fact, this is not the case. Reali and Chris-
tiansen (2005) show that n-gram models can be
used to distinguish grammatical from ungrammat-
ical auxiliary fronted polar questions with a high
degree of success. More recently Frank et al.
(2012) argue for the view that a purely sequen-
tial, non-hierarchical view of linguistic structure is

adequate to account for most aspects of linguistic
knowledge and processing.

We have constructed an experiment with differ-
ent (pre-identified) passive structures that provides
significant support for our hypothesis that lexical
n-gram models are very good at capturing local
syntactic relations, but cannot handle more distant
dependencies.

In future work we will be experimenting with
more expressive language models that can repre-
sent non-local syntactic relations. We will pro-
ceed conservatively by first extending our enriched
lexical n-gram models to chunking models, and
then to dependency grammar models, using only
as much syntactic structure as is required to iden-
tify the judgement patterns that we are studying.

To the extent that this research is successful it
will provide motivation for the view that syntactic
knowledge is inherently probabilistic in nature.
