Abstract

We present an experimental study of how dif-
ferent features help measuring the idiomatic-
ity of noun+verb (NV) expressions in Basque.
After testing several techniques for quantify-
ing the four basic properties of multiword ex-
pressions or MWEs (institutionalization, se-
mantic non-compositionality, morphosyntac-
tic fixedness and lexical fixedness), we test
different combinations of them for classifica-
tion into idioms and collocations, using Ma-
chine Learning (ML) and feature selection.
The results show the major role of distribu-
tional similarity, which measures composi-
tionality, in the extraction and classification
of MWEs, especially, as expected, in the case
of idioms. Even though cooccurrence and
some aspects of morphosyntactic flexibility
contribute to this task in a more limited mea-
sure, ML experiments make benefit of these
sources of knowledge, allowing to improve
the results obtained using exclusively distribu-
tional similarity features.

1 Introduction

Idiomaticity is considered the defining feature of the
concept of multiword expressions (MWE). It is de-
scribed as a non-discrete magnitude, whose “value”
depends on a combination of features like in-
stitutionalization, non-compositionality and lexico-
syntactic fixedness (Granger and Paquot, 2008).

Idiomaticity appears as a continuum rather than as
a series of discrete values. Thus, the classification of
MWEs into discrete categories is a difficult task. A
very schematic classification that has achieved a fair

degree of general acceptance among experts distin-
guishes two main types of MWEs at phrase-level:
idioms and collocations.

This complexity of the concept of idiomaticity has
posed a challenge to the development of methods
addressing the measurement of the aforementioned
four properties. Recent research has resulted in
this issue nowadays being usually addressed through
measuring the following phenomena: (i) cooccur-
rence, for institutionalization; (ii) distributional sim-
ilarity, for non-compositionality; (iii) deviation from
the behavior of free combinations, for morphosyn-
tactic fixedness; and (iv) substitutability, for lexical
fixedness. This is the broad context of our experi-
mental work on the automatic classification of NV
expressions in Basque.

2.1 Statistical Idiosyncrasy or
Institutionalization

Using the cooccurrence of the components of a com-
bination as a heuristic of its institutionalization goes
back to early research on this field (Church and
Hanks, 1990), and is computed using association
measures (AM), usually in combination with lin-
guistic techniques, which allows the use of lemma-
tized and POS-tagged corpora, or the use of syntac-
tic dependencies (Seretan, 2011). In recent years,
the comparative analysis of AMs (Evert, 2005) and
the combination of them (Lin et al., 2008; Pecina,
2010) have aroused considerable interest.

This approach has been recently explored in
Basque (Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2011).

2.2 Compositionality

The central concept in characterizing compositional-
ity is the hypothesis of distributional similarity (DS)
As proposed by Baldwin and Kim (2010), “the un-
derlying hypothesis is that semantically idiomatic
MWEs will occur in markedly different lexical con-
texts to their component words.”

Berry-Rogghe (1974) proposed R-value to mea-
sure the compositionality of verb-particle construc-
tions (VPCs), by dividing the overlap between the
sets of collocates associated with the particle by
the total number of collocates of the VPC. Wulff
(2010) proposes two extensions to the R-value
in her research on verb-preposition-noun construc-
tions, combining and weighting in different ways in-
dividual R-values of each component.

The Vector Space Model (VSM) is applied,
among others, by Fazly and Stevenson (2007), who
use the cosine as a similarity measure. The shared
task Distributional Semantics and Compositionality
(DiSCo) at ACL-HLT 2011 shows a variety of tech-
niques for this task, mainly association measures
and VSM (Biemann and Giesbrecht, 2011). LSA
(Latent Semantic Analysis) is used in several stud-
ies (Baldwin et al., 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006;
Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).

Those approaches have been applied recently to
Basque (Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2012)

2.3 Morphosyntactic Flexibility (MSFlex)

Morphosyntactic fixedness is usually computed in
terms of relative flexibility, as the statistical dis-
tance between the behavior of the combination and
(i) the average behavior of the combinations with
equal POS composition (Fazly and Stevenson, 2007;
Wulff, 2010), or (ii) the average behavior of the
combinations containing each one of the compo-
nents of the combination (Bannard, 2007).

Fazly and Stevenson (2007) use Kullback-
Leibler divergence (KL-div) to compute this dis-
tance. They analyze a set of patterns: determination
(a/the), demonstratives, possessives, singular/plural
and passive. They compute two additional measure-
ments (dominant pattern and presence of absence of
adjectival modifiers preceding the noun).

Wulff (2010) considers (i) tree-syntactic, (ii)
lexico-syntactic and (iii) morphological flexibilities,

and implements two metrics for these features: (i) an
extension of Barkema proposal (NSSD, normalized
sum of squared deviations), (ii) a special conception
of “relative entropy” (Hrel).

Bannard (2007), using CPMI (conditional point-
wise mutual information), analyses these variants:
(i) variation, addition or dropping of a determiner;
(ii) internal modification of the noun phrase; and (iii)
verb passivation.

2.4 Lexical Flexibility (LFlex)
The usual procedure for measuring lexical flexibility
is to compute the substitutability of each component
of the combination using as substitutes its synony-
mous, quasi-synonyms, related words, etc.

The pioneering work in this field is Lin (1999),
who uses a thesaurus automatically built from text.
This resource is used in recent research (Fazly and
Stevenson, 2007). They assume that the target pair
is lexically fixed to the extent that its PMI deviates
from the average PMI of its variants generated by
lexical substitution. They compute flexibility using
the z-score.

In Van de Cruys and Moirón (2007), a technique
based on KL-div is used for Duch. They define Rnv
as the ratio of noun preference for a particular verb
(its KL-div), compared to the other nouns that are
present in the cluster of substitutes. Similarly for
Rvn. The substitute candidates are obtained from
the corpus using standard distributional similarity
techniques.

2.5 Other Methods
Fazly and Stevenson (2007) consider two other fea-
tures: (i) the verb itself; and (ii) the semantic cate-
gory of the noun according to WordNet.

2.6 Combined Systems
In order to combine several sources of knowledge,
several studies have experimented with using Ma-
chine Learning methods (ML).

For Czech, Pecina (2010) combines only AMs us-
ing neural networks, logistic regression and SVM
(Support Vector Machine). Lin et al. (2008) employ
logistic linear regression model (LLRM) to combine
scores of AMs.

Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) propose a mini-
mally supervised classification scheme that incorpo-

117



rates a variety of features to group verb-noun combi-
nations. Their features drawn from AM and DS, but
some of each type are tested and combined. They
compute ranking correlation using SVM, achieving
results of about 0.45.

Fazly and Stevenson (2007) use all the types of
knowledge, and decision trees (C5.0) as a learning
method, and achieve average results (F-score) near
to 0.60 for 4 classes (literal, abstract, light verbs and
idioms). The authors claim that the syntactic and
combined fixedness measures substantially outper-
form measures of collocation extraction.

3 Experimental Setup

3.1 Corpus and Preprocessing

We use a journalistic corpus of 75 million words
(MW) from two sources: (1) Issues published
in 2001-2002 by the newspaper Euskaldunon
Egunkaria (28 MW); and (2) Issues published in
2006-2010 by the newspaper Berria (47 MW).

The corpus is annotated with lemma, POS, fine
grained POS (subPOS), case and number informa-
tion using Eustagger developed by the IXA group of
the University of the Basque Country. A precision of
95.42% is reported for POS + subPOS + case analy-
sis (Oronoz et al., 2010).

3.2 Extraction of Bigram Candidates

The key data for defining a Basque NV bigram are
lemma and case for the noun, and lemma for the
verb. Case data is needed to differentiate, for exam-
ple, kontu hartu (“to ask for an explanation”) from
kontuan hartu (“to take into account”), where kontu
is a noun lemma in the inessive case.

In order to propose canonical forms, we need, for
nouns, token, case and number annotations in bi-
gram data. Those canonical forms can be formulated
using number normalization, as described in Gur-
rutxaga and Alegria (2011). Bigrams belonging to
the same key noun lemma/noun case+verb lemma
are normalized; a single bigram with the most fre-
quent form is created, and the frequencies of bi-
grams and those of the noun unigrams summed.

We use the Ngram Statistics Package-
NSP (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2010) to generate NV
bigrams from a corpus generated from the output of
Eustagger. Taking into account our previous results

(Gurrutxaga and Alegria, 2011), we use a window
span of ±1 and a frequency threshold of f > 30.
Before generation, some surface-grammar rules are
applied to correct annotations that produce noise.
For example, in most Basque AdjN combinations,
the adjetive is a verb in a participe form (eg. indar
armatuak, ‘armed forces’). Similarly, those kind
of participles can function as nouns (gobernuaren
aliatuak, ‘the allies of the government’). Not
tagging those participles properly would introduce
noise in the extraction of NV combinations.

3.3 Experiments Using Single Knowledge
Sources

3.3.1 Cooccurrence
The cooccurrence data provided by NSP in the bi-

gram extraction step is processed to calculate AMs.
To accomplish this, we use Stefan Evert’s UCS
toolkit (Evert, 2005). The most common AMs are
calculated: f , t-score, log-likelihood ratio, MI, MI3,
and chi-square (χ2).

3.3.2 Distributional Similarity
The idea is to compare the contexts of each NV

bigram with the contexts of its corresponding com-
ponents, by means of different techniques. The
more similar the contexts, the more compositional
the combination.

Context Generation We extract the context words
of each bigram from the sentences with contiguous
cooccurrences of the components. The noun has to
occur in the grammatical case in which it has been
defined after bigram normalization.

The contexts of the corresponding noun and verb
are extracted separately from sentences where they
did not occur together. Only content-bearing lem-
mas are included in the contexts (nouns, verbs and
adjectives).

Context Comparison We process the contexts in
two different ways:

First, we construct a VSM model, representing
the contexts as vectors. As similarity measures, we
use Berry-Roghe’s R-value (RBR) and the two ex-
tensions to it proposed by Wulff (RW1 and RW2),
Jaccard index and cosine. For the cosine, different
AMs have been tested for vector weights (f , t-score,

118



LLR and PMI). We experiment with different per-
centages of the vector and different numbers of col-
locates, using the aforementioned measures to rank
the collocates. The 100 most frequent words in the
corpus are stopped.

Second, we represent the same contexts as doc-
uments, and compare them by means of differ-
ent indexes using the Lemur Toolkit (Allan et al.,
2003). The contexts of the bigrams are used as
queries against a document collection containing the
context-documents of all the members of the bi-
grams. This can be implemented in different ways;
the best results were obtained using the following:

• Lemur 1 (L1): As with vectors, the contexts of
a bigram are included in a single query docu-
ment, and the same is done for the contexts of
its members

• Lemur 2 (L2): The context sentences of bi-
grams are treated as individual documents, but
the contexts of each one of its members are rep-
resented in two separate documents

Due to processing reasons, the number of context
sentences used in Lemur to generate documents is
limited to 2,000 (randomly selected from the whole
set of contexts).

We further tested LSA (using Infomap1), but the
above methods yielded better results.

3.3.3 Morphosyntactic Flexibility
We focus on the variation of the N slot, dis-

tinguishing the main type of extensions and num-
ber inflections. Among left-extensions, we take
into account relative clauses. In addition, we con-
sider the order of components as a parameter. We
present some examples of the free combination libu-
rua irakurri (“to read a book”)

• Determiner: liburu bat irakurri dut (“I have
read one book”), zenbat liburu irakurri dituzu?
(“how many books have you read?”)

• Postnominal adjective: liburu interesgarria
irakurri nuen (“I read an interesting book”)

• Prenominal adjective: italierazko liburua
irakurri (“to read a book in Italian”)

1http://infomap-nlp.sourceforge.net/

• Relative clause: irakurri dudan liburua (“the
book I have read”), anaiak irakurritako liburu
batzuk (“some books read by my brother”)

• Number inflection: liburua/liburuak/
liburu/liburuok irakurri (“to read
a/some/∅/these book(s)”)

• Order of components (NV / VN): liburua
irakurri dut / irakurri dut liburua (“I have read
a book”)

We count the number of variations for each bi-
gram, for all NV bigrams, and for each combination
of the type bigram component+POS of the other
component (e.g, for liburua irakurri, the variations
of all the combinations liburua+V and N+irakurri).

To calculate flexibility, we experiment with all the
measures described in section 2.3: Fazly’s KL-div,
Wulff’s NSSD and Hrel (relative entropy), and Ban-
nard’s CPMI.

3.3.4 Lexical Flexibility
In order to test the substitutability of the compo-

nents of bigrams, we use two resources: (i) ELH:
Sinonimoen Kutxa, a Basque dictionary of syn-
onyms, published by the Elhuyar Foundation (for
nouns and verbs, 40,146 word-synomyn pairs); (ii)
WN: the Basque version of WordNet2(68,217 word-
synomyn pairs). First, we experimented with both
resources on their own, but the results show that
in many cases there either was no substitute candi-
date, or the corpus lacked combinations containing
a substitute. In order to ensure a broader coverage,
we combined both resources (ELHWN), and we ex-
panded the set of substitutes including the siblings
retrieved from Basque WordNet (ELHWNexpand).

To calculate flexibility, we experiment with the
two measures described in section 2.4: z-score and
KL-div based R.

3.4 Combining Knowledge Sources Using
Machine Learning

We use some ML methods included in the Weka
toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) in order to combine re-
sults obtained in experiments using single knowl-
edge sources (described in section 3.3). The values

2http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/cgi-bin/mcr/public/wei.consult.perl

119



of the different measures obtained in those experi-
ments were set as features.

We have selected five methods corresponding to
different kind of techniques which have been used
successfully in this field: Naive Bayes, C4.5 deci-
sion tree (j48), Random Forest, SVM (SMO algo-
rithm) and Logistic Regression. Test were carried
out using either all features, the features from each
type of knowledge, and some subsets, obtained af-
ter manual and automatic selection. Following Fa-
zly and Stevenson (2007), verbs are also included as
features.

Since, as we will see in section 3.5, the amount of
instances in the evaluation dataset is not very high
(1,145), cross-validation is used in the experiments
for model validation (5 folds). In the case of auto-
matic attribute selection, we use AttributeSelected-
Classifier, which encapsulates the attribute selection
process with the classifier itself, so the attribute se-
lection method and the classifier only see the data in
the training set of each fold.

3.5 Evaluation

3.5.1 Reference Dataset and Human
Judgments

As an evaluation reference, we use a subset of
1,200 combinations selected randomly from a ex-
tracted set of 4,334 bigrams, that is the result of
merging the 2,000-best candidates of each AM rank-
ing from the w = ±1 and f > 30 extraction set.

The subset has been manually classified by three
lexicographers into idioms, collocations and free
combinations. Annotators were provided with an
evaluation manual, containing the guidelines for
classification and illustrative examples.

The agreement among evaluators was calculated
using Fleiss’ κ. We obtained a value of 0.58, which
can be considered moderate, close to fair, agree-
ment. Although this level of agreement is relatively
low when compared to Krenn et al. (2004), it is
comparable to the one reported by Pecina (2010),
who attributed his “relatively low” value to the fact
that “the notion of collocation is very subjective,
domain-specific, and also somewhat vague.” Street
et al. (2010) obtain quite low inter-annotator agree-
ment for annotation of idioms in the ANC (Ameri-
can National Corpus). Hence, we consider that the

level of agreement we have achieved is acceptable.
For the final classification of the evaluation set,

cases where agreement was two or higher were au-
tomatically adopted, and the remaining cases were
classified after discussion. We removed 55 combina-
tions that did not belong to the NV category, or that
were part of larger MWEs. The final set included
1,145 items, out of which 80 were idioms 268 collo-
cations, and 797 free combinations.

3.5.2 Procedure
In order to compare the results of the individual

techniques, we based our evaluation on the rank-
ings provided by each measure. If we were to have
an ideal measure, the set of bigram categories (‘id’,
‘col’ and ‘free’) would be an ordered set, with ‘id’
values on top of the ranking, ‘col’ in the middle, and
‘free’ at the bottom. Thus, the idea is to compute
the distance between a rank derived from the ideally
ordered set, which contains a high number of ties,
and the rank yielded by each measure. To this end,
we use Kendall’s τB as a rank-correlation measure.
Statistical significance of the Kendall’s τB correla-
tion coefficient is tested with the Z-test. The realistic
topline, yielded by a measure that ranks candidates
ideally, but without ties, would be 0.68.

In addition, average precision values (AP) were
calculated for each ranking.

In the case of association measures, similarity
measures applied to VSM, and measures of flexibil-
ity, the bigrams were ranked by means of the val-
ues of the corresponding measure. In the case of ex-
periments with Lemur, the information used to rank
the bigrams consisted of the positions of the docu-
ments corresponding to each member of the bigram
in the document list retrieved (‘rank’ in Table 1). For
the experiments in which the context sentences have
been distributed in different documents, average po-
sitions were calculated and weighted, in relation to
the amount of documents for each bigram analysis
(‘rank weight’). The total number of documents in
the list (or ‘hits’) is weighted in the same manner
(‘hit rel’).

When using ML techniques, several measures
provided by Weka were analyzed: percentage of
Correctly Classified Instances (CCI), F-measures
for each class (id, col, free), Weighted Average F-
measure and Average F-measure.

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Single Knowledge Experiments

The results for Kendall’s τB and AP for MWEs and
separate AP values for idioms and collocations are
summarized in Table 1 (only the experiments with
the most noteworthy results are included).

The best results are obtained in the Lemur exper-
iments, most notably in the Lemur 2 type, using ei-
ther Indri or KL-div indexes. In the MWE rankings,
measures of the R-value type only slightly outper-
form AMs.

In the case of idioms, DS measures obtain signif-
icantly better ranks than the other measures. Idioms
being the least compositional expressions, his result
is expected, and supports the hypothesis that seman-
tic compositionality can better be characterized us-

ing measures of DS than using AMs.
Regarding collocations, no such claim can be

made, as the AP values for t-score and f outper-
form DS values, with a remarkable exception: the
best AP is obtained by an Indri index that com-
pares the semantic similarity between the verb in
combination with the noun and the verb in contexts
without the noun (L2 Indri rankV weight), accord-
ingly with the claim that the semantics of the verb
contribute to the semicompositionality of colloca-
tions. By contrast, the corresponding measure for
the noun (L2 Indri rankN weight) works quite a bit
better with idioms than the previous verb measure.

Figure 1 shows the precision curves for the extrac-
tion of MWEs by the best measure of each compo-
nent of idiomaticity.

In Figure 2 and 3, we present separately the preci-

sion curves for idioms and collocations. We plot the
measures with the best precision values.

Figure 2: Precision results for the compositionality rank-
ings of idioms.

Regarding the precision for collocations in Fig-
ure 3, the differences are not obviously significant.
Even though the DS measure has the better perfor-
mance, precision values for the t-score are not too
much lower, and the t-score has a similar perfor-
mance at the beginning of the ranking (n < 150).

4.2 Machine Learning Experiments

We report only the results of the three methods with
the best overall performance: Logistic Regression
(LR), SMO and RandomForest (RF).

In Table 2, we present the results obtained with
datasets containing only DS attributes (the source
of knowledge with the best results in single ex-

Figure 3: Precision results for the compositionality rank-
ings of collocations.

periments); datasets containing all features corre-
sponding to the four properties of idiomaticity; and
datasets obtained adding the verb of the bigram as a
string-type attribute.

As the figures show, it is difficult to improve the
results obtained using only DS. The results of SMO
are better when the features of the four components
of idiomaticity are used, and even better when the
verb is added, especially for idioms. The verb causes
the performance of RF be slightly worse; in the case
of LR, it generates considerable noise.

It can be observed that the figures for LR are
more unstable. Using SMO and RF, convergence
does not depend on how many noisy variables are
present (Biau, 2012). Thus, feature selection could
improve the results when LR is used.

In a complementary experiment, we observed the
impact of removing the attributes of each source of
knowledge (without including verbs). The most ev-
ident result was that the exclusion of LFlex features
contributes the most to improving F. This was an ex-
pected effect, considering the poor results for LFlex
measures described in section 4.1. More interest-
ing is the fact that removing MSFlex features had a
higher negative impact on F than not taking AMs as
features.

Table 3 shows the results for two datasets gener-
ated through two manual selection of attributes: (1)
manual 1: the 20 attributes with best AP average re-
sults; and (2) manual 2: a manual selection of the
attributes from each knowledge source with the best
AP MWE, best AP id and best AP col. The third

at the results of the selection process in each fold, we
saw that the attributes selected in more than 2 folds
are 36: 1 AM, 20 from DS, 7 from MSFlex, 1 from
LFlex and 7 verbs.

The results show that, for each method, auto-
matic selection outperforms the two manual selec-
tions. Most of the attributes automatically selected
are DS measures, but it is interesting to observe that
MSFlex and the verb slot contribute to improving
the results. Using automatic attribute selection and

using SMO and all the features (0.727 vs 0.744).

5 Discussion

The most important conclusions from our experi-
ments are the following:

• In the task of ranking the candidates, the best
results are obtained using DS measures, and,
in particular, Indri and KL-div in L2 experi-
ments. This is true for both type of MWEs, and
is ratified in ML experiments when automatic
attribute filtering is carried out. It is, however,
particularly notable with regard to idioms; in
the case of collocations, the difference between
the performance of DS and that of and MS and
AM were not that significant.

• MSFlex contributes to the classification task
when used in combination with DS, but get
poor results by themselves. The most relevant
parameter MSFlex is number inflection.

• SMO is the most precise method when a high
amount of features is used. It gets the best over-
all F-score. The other methods need feature se-
lection to obtain similar results.

• Automatic attribute selection using CS-BF fil-
ter yields better results than manual selections.
The method that takes the most advantage is
LR, whose scores are little bit worse than those
of SMO using the whole set of attributes.

Some of these conclusions differ from those reached
by earlier works. In particular, the claims in Fazly
and Stevenson (2007) and Van de Cruys and Moirón
(2007) that syntactic as well as lexical flexibility out-
perform other techniques of MWE characterization
are not confirmed in this work for Basque. Some
hypothesis could be formulated to explain those
differences: (1) Basque idioms could be syntacti-
cally more flexible, whereas some free combinations
could present a non-negligible level of fixedness; (2)
Basque, especially in the journalistic register, could
be sociolinguistically less fixed than, say, English
or Spanish; thus, the lexical choice of the collocate
could be not so clearly established; (3) the Basque
lexical resources to test substitutability could have
insufficient coverage; and (4) Fazly and Stevenson
(2007) use the cosine for DS, a measure which in our
experiments is clearly below other measures. Those
hypotheses require experimental testing and deeper
linguistic analysis.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented an in-depth analysis of the per-
formance of different features of idiomaticity in the
characterization of NV expressions, and the results
obtained combining them using ML methods. The
results confirm the major role of DS, especially, as
expected, in the case of idioms. It is remarkable that
the best results have been obtained using Lemur, an
IR tool. ML experiments show that other features
contribute to improve the results, especially some
aspects of MSFlex, the verb of the bigram and, to
a more limited extent, AMs. The performance of
DS being the best one for idioms confirm previous
research on other languages, but MSFlex and LFlex
behave below the expected. The explanations pro-
posed for this issue require further verification.

We are planning experiments using these tech-
niques for discriminating between literal and id-
iomatic occurrences of MWEs in context. Work on
parallel corpora is planned for the future.
