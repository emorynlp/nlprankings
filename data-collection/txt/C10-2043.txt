Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel frame-
work to enrich Translation Memory (TM)
systems with Statistical Machine Trans-
lation (SMT) outputs using ranking.
In
order to offer the human translators mul-
tiple choices, instead of only using the
top SMT output and top TM hit, we
merge the N-best output from the SMT
system and the k-best hits with highest
fuzzy match scores from the TM sys-
tem. The merged list is then ranked ac-
cording to the prospective post-editing ef-
fort and provided to the translators to aid
their work. Experiments show that our
ranked output achieve 0.8747 precision at
top 1 and 0.8134 precision at top 5. Our
framework facilitates a tight integration
between SMT and TM, where full advan-
tage is taken of TM while high quality
SMT output is availed of to improve the
productivity of human translators.

1 Introduction
Translation Memories (TM) are databases that
store translated segments. They are often used to
assist translators and post-editors in a Computer
Assisted Translation (CAT) environment by re-
turning the most similar translated segments. Pro-
fessional post-editors and translators have long
been relying on TMs to avoid duplication of work
in translation.

With the rapid development in statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT), MT systems are begin-

ning to generate acceptable translations, espe-
cially in domains where abundant parallel corpora
exist. It is thus natural to ask if these translations
can be utilized in some way to enhance TMs.

However advances in MT are being adopted
only slowly and sometimes somewhat reluctantly
in professional localization and post-editing envi-
ronments because of 1) the usefulness of the TM,
2) the investment and effort the company has put
into TMs, and 3) the lack of robust SMT conﬁ-
dence estimation measures which are as reliable
as fuzzy match scores (cf. Section 4.1.2) used in
TMs. Currently the localization industry relies on
TM fuzzy match scores to obtain both a good ap-
proximation of post-editing effort and an estima-
tion of the overall translation cost.

In a forthcoming paper, we propose a trans-
lation recommendation model to better integrate
MT outputs into a TM system. Using a binary
classiﬁer, we only recommend an MT output to
the TM-user when the classiﬁer is highly conﬁ-
dent that it is better than the TM output. In this
framework, post-editors continue to work with the
TM while beneﬁting from (better) SMT outputs;
the assets in TMs are not wasted and TM fuzzy
match scores can still be used to estimate (the up-
per bound of) post-editing labor.

In the previous work,

the binary predictor
works on the 1-best output of the MT and TM sys-
tems, presenting either the one or the other to the
post-editor. In this paper, we develop the idea fur-
ther by moving from binary prediction to ranking.
We use a ranking model to merge the k-best lists
of the two systems, and produce a ranked merged

375

list for post-editing. As the list is an enriched ver-
sion of the TM’s k-best list, the TM related assets
are better preserved and the cost estimation is still
valid as an upper bound.

More speciﬁcally, we recast SMT-TM integra-
tion as a ranking problem, where we apply the
Ranking SVM technique to produce a ranked list
of translations combining the k-best lists of both
the MT and the TM systems. We use features in-
dependent of the MT and TM systems for rank-
ing, so that outputs from MT and TM can have
the same set of features.
Ideally the transla-
tions should be ranked by their associated post-
editing efforts, but given the very limited amounts
of human annotated data, we use an automatic
MT evaluation metric, TER (Snover et al., 2006),
which is speciﬁcally designed to simulate post-
editing effort to train and test our ranking model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
we ﬁrst brieﬂy introduce related research in Sec-
tion 2, and review Ranking SVMs in Section 3.
The formulation of the problem and experiments
with the ranking models are presented in Sections
4 and 5. We analyze the post-editing effort ap-
proximated by the TER metric in Section 6. Sec-
tion 7 concludes and points out avenues for future
research.

2 Related Work
There has been some work to help TM users to
apply MT outputs more smoothly. One strand is
to improve the MT conﬁdence measures to bet-
ter predict post-editing effort in order to obtain a
quality estimation that has the potential to replace
the fuzzy match score in the TM. To the best of
our knowledge, the ﬁrst paper in this area is (Spe-
cia et al., 2009a), which uses regression on both
the automatic scores and scores assigned by post-
editors. The method is improved in (Specia et
al., 2009b), which applies Inductive Conﬁdence
Machines and a larger set of features to model
post-editors’ judgment of the translation quality
between ‘good’ and ‘bad’, or among three levels
of post-editing effort.

Another strand is to integrate high conﬁdence
MT outputs into the TM, so that the ‘good’ TM
entries will remain untouched. In our forthcoming
paper, we recommend SMT outputs to a TM user

when a binary classiﬁer predicts that SMT outputs
are more suitable for post-editing for a particular
sentence.

The research presented here continues the line
of research in the second strand. The difference
is that we do not limit ourselves to the 1-best out-
put but try to produce a k-best output in a rank-
ing model. The ranking scheme also enables us
to show all TM hits to the user, and thus further
protects the TM assets.

There has also been work to improve SMT us-
ing the knowledge from the TM. In (Simard and
Isabelle, 2009), the SMT system can produce a
better translation when there is an exact or close
match in the corresponding TM. They use regres-
sion Support Vector Machines to model the qual-
ity of the TM segments. This is also related to
our work in spirit, but our work is in the opposite
direction, i.e. using SMT to enrich TM.

Moreover, our ranking model

is related to
reranking (Shen et al., 2004) in SMT as well.
However, our method does not focus on produc-
ing better 1-best translation output for an SMT
system, but on improving the overall quality of the
k-best list that TM systems present to post-editors.
Some features in our work are also different in na-
ture to those used in MT reranking. For instance
we cannot use N-best posterior scores as they do
not make sense for the TM outputs.

3 The Support Vector Machines
3.1 The SVM Classiﬁer
Classical SVMs (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) are
binary classiﬁers that classify an input instance
based on decision rules which minimize the reg-
ularized error function in (Eq. 1):

min
w,b,ξ

subject to:

ξi

l∑i=1

1
wT w + C
2
yi(wT xi + b) > 1 − ξi
ξi > 0

(1)

where (xi, yi) ∈ Rn × {1,−1} are l training in-
stances. w is the weight vector, ξ is the relaxation
variable and C > 0 is the penalty parameter.

3.2 Ranking SVM for SMT-TM Integration
The SVM classiﬁcation algorithm is extended to
the ranking case in (Joachims, 2002). For a cer-

376

tain group of instances, the Ranking SVM aims
at producing a ranking r that has the maximum
Kendall’s τ coefﬁcient with the the gold standard
ranking r∗.

Kendall’s τ measures the relevance of two rank-
ings: τ (ra, rb) = P−Q
P +Q, where P and Q are
the amount of concordant and discordant pairs in
ra and rb.
In practice, this is done by building
constraints to minimize the discordant pairs Q.
Following the basic idea, we show how Ranking
SVM can be applied to MT-TM integration as fol-
lows.

Assume that for each source sentence s, we
have a set of outputs from MT, M and a set of
outputs from TM, T. If we have a ranking r(s)

over translation outputs M∪ T where for each
translation output d ∈ M∪ T, (di, dj) ∈ r(s) iff

di <r(s) dj, we can rewrite the ranking constraints
as optimization constraints in an SVM, as in Eq.
(2).

wT w + C∑ ξ

min
w,b,ξ
subject to:
∀(di, dj) ∈ r(s1) : w(Φ(s1, di) − Φ(s1, dj)) > 1 − ξi,j,1
...
∀(di, dj) ∈ r(sn) : w(Φ(sn, di) − Φ(sn, dj)) > 1 − ξi,j,n
ξi,j,k > 0
(2)
where Φ(sn, di) is a feature vector of translation
output di given source sentence sn. The Ranking
SVM minimizes the discordant number of rank-
ings with the gold standard according to Kendall’s
τ.

When the instances are not linearly separable,
we use a mapping function ϕ to map the features
xi (Φ(sn, di) in the case of ranking) to high di-
mensional space, and solve the SVM with a kernel
function K in where K(xi, xj) = ϕ(xi)T ϕ(xj).

We perform our experiments with the Radial

Basis Function (RBF) kernel, as in Eq. (3).

K(xi, xj) = exp(−γ||xi − xj||2), γ > 0

4 The Ranking-based Integration Model
In this section we present
the Ranking-based
SMT-TM integration model in detail. We ﬁrst in-
troduce the k-best lists in MT (called N-best list)
and TM systems (called m-best list in this section)
and then move on to the problem formulation and
the feature set.

4.1 K-Best Lists in SMT and TM
4.1.1 The SMT N-best List

The N-best list of the SMT system is generated
during decoding according to the internal feature
scores. The features include language and transla-
tion model probabilities, reordering model scores
and a word penalty.
4.1.2 The TM M-Best List and the Fuzzy

Match Score

The m-best list of the TM system is gener-
ated in descending fuzzy match score. The fuzzy
match score (Sikes, 2007) uses the similarity of
the source sentences to predict a level to which a
translation is reusable or editable.

The calculation of fuzzy match scores is one of
the core technologies in TM systems and varies
among different vendors. We compute fuzzy
match cost as the minimum Edit Distance (Lev-
enshtein, 1966) between the source and TM en-
try, normalized by the length of the source as in
Eq. (4), as most of the current implementations
are based on edit distance while allowing some
additional ﬂexible matching.

F uzzyM atch(t) = min

e

EditDistance(s, e)

Len(s)

(4)

where s is the source side of the TM hit t, and e
is the source side of an entry in the TM.

4.2 Problem Formulation
Ranking lists is a well-researched problem in
the information retrieval community, and Ranking
SVMs (Joachims, 2002), which optimizes on the
ranking correlation τ have already been applied
successfully in machine translation evaluation (Ye
et al., 2007). We apply the same method here to
rerank a merged list of MT and TM outputs.

Formally given an MT-produced N-best list
M = {m1, m2, ..., mn}, a TM-produced m-best
list T = {t1, t2, ..., tm} for a input sentence s,
we deﬁne the gold standard using the TER met-
ric (Snover et al., 2006): for each d ∈ M∪ T,
(di, dj) ∈ r(s) iff T ER(di) < T ER(dj). We
train and test a Ranking SVM using cross vali-
dation on a data set created according to this cri-
terion.
Ideally the gold standard would be cre-
ated by human annotators. We choose to use TER

377

as large-scale annotation is not yet available for
this task. Furthermore, TER has a high correla-
tion with the HTER score (Snover et al., 2006),
which is the TER score using the post-edited MT
output as a reference, and is used as an estimation
of post-editing effort.

4.3 The Feature Set

When building features for the Ranking SVM, we
are limited to features that are independent of the
MT and TM system. We experiment with system-
independent ﬂuency and ﬁdelity features below,
which capture translation ﬂuency and adequacy,
respectively.

4.3.1 Fluency Features

Source-side Language Model Scores. We
compute the LM probability and perplexity of the
input source sentence on a language model trained
on the source-side training data of the SMT sys-
tem, which is also the TM database. The inputs
that have lower perplexity on this language model
are more similar to the data set on which the SMT
system is built.

Target-side Language Model Scores. We com-
pute the LM probability and perplexity as a mea-
sure of the ﬂuency of the translation.

4.3.2 Fidelity Features

The Pseudo-Source Fuzzy Match Score. We
translate the output back to obtain a pseudo source
sentence. We compute the fuzzy match score
between the original source sentence and this
pseudo-source.
If the MT/TM performs well
enough, these two sentences should be the same
or very similar. Therefore the fuzzy match score
here gives an estimation of the conﬁdence level of
the output.

The IBM Model 1 Score. We compute the IBM
Model 1 score in both directions to measure the
correspondence between the source and target, as
it serves as a rough estimation of how good a
translation it is on the word level.

5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Settings
5.1.1 Data

Our raw data set is an English–French trans-
lation memory with technical translation from a
multi-national IT security company, consisting of
51K sentence pairs. We randomly select 43K to
train an SMT system and translate the English side
of the remaining 8K sentence pairs, which is used
to run cross validation. Note that the 8K sentence
pairs are from the same TM, so that we are able to
create a gold standard by ranking the TER scores
of the MT and TM outputs.

Duplicated sentences are removed from the
data set, as those will lead to an exact match in
the TM system and will not be translated by trans-
lators. The average sentence length of the training
set is 13.5 words and the size of the training set
is comparable to the (larger) translation memories
used in the industry.

5.1.2 SMT and TM systems

a

We use

standard log-linear PB-SMT
model (Och and Ney, 2002): GIZA++ imple-
mentation of IBM word alignment model 4, the
phrase-extraction heuristics described in (Koehn
et al., 2003), minimum-error-rate training (Och,
2003), a 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney
smoothing trained with SRILM (Stolcke, 2002)
on the English side of the training data, and
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to decode. We train a
system in the opposite direction using the same
data to produce the pseudo-source sentences.

We merge distinct 5-best lists from MT and TM
systems to produce a new ranking. To create the
distinct list for the SMT system, we search over
a 100-best list and keep the top-5 distinct out-
puts. Our data set consists of mainly short sen-
tences, leading to many duplications in the N-best
output of the SMT decoder. In such cases, top-
5 distinct outputs are good representations of the
SMT’s output.

5.2 Training, Tuning and Testing the

Ranking SVM

We run training and prediction of the Ranking
SVM in 4-fold cross validation. We use the

378

SVMlight1 toolkit to perform training and testing.
When using the Ranking SVM with the RBF
kernel, we have two free parameters to tune on:
the cost parameter C in Eq.
(1) and the radius
parameter γ in Eq.
(3). We optimize C and
γ using a brute-force grid search before running
cross-validation and maximize precision at top-5,
with an inner 3-fold cross validation on the (outer)
Fold-1 training set. We search within the range
[2−6, 29], the step size is 2 on the exponent.

5.3 The Gold Standard

Figure 1: MT and TM’s percentage in gold stan-
dard

Figure 1 shows the composition of translations
in the gold standard. Each source sentence is asso-
ciated with a list of translations from two sources,
i.e. MT output and TM matches. This list of
translations is ranked from best to worst accord-
ing TER scores. The ﬁgure shows that over 80%
of the translations are from the MT system if we
only consider the top-1 translation. As the num-
ber of top translations we consider increases, more
TM matches can be seen. On the one hand, this
does show a large gap in quality between MT out-
put and TM matches; on the other hand, however,
it also reveals that we will have to ensure two ob-
jectives in ranking:
the ﬁrst is to rank the 80%
MT translations higher and the second is to keep
the 20% ‘good’ TM hits in the Top-5. We design
our evaluation metrics accordingly.

5.4 Evaluation Metrics
The aim of this research is to provide post-editors
with translations that in many cases are easier to

1http://svmlight.joachims.org/

edit than the original TM output. As we formulate
this as a ranking problem, it is natural to measure
the quality of the ranking output by the number
of better translations that are ranked high. Some-
times the top TM output is the easiest to edit; in
such a case we need to ensure that this translation
has a high rank, otherwise the system performance
will degrade.

Based on this observation, we introduce the
idea of relevant translations, and our evaluation
metrics: PREC@k and HIT@k.

Relevant Translations. We borrow the idea
of relevence from the IR community to deﬁne
the idea of translations worth ranking high. For
a source sentence s which has a top TM hit t,
we deﬁne an MT/TM output m as relevant, if
T ER(m) ≤ T ER(t). According to the deﬁni-
tion, relevant translations should need no more
post-edits than the original top hit from the TM
system. Clearly the top TM hit is always relevant.
We calculate the precision
(PREC@k) of the ranking for evaluation. As-
suming that there are n relevant translations in
the top k list for a source sentence s, we have
PREC@k= n/k for s. We test PREC@k, for
k = 1...10, in order to evaluate the overall quality
of the ranking.

PREC@k.

HIT@k. We also estimate the probability of
having one of the relevant translations in the top
k, denoted as HIT@k. For a source sentence s,
HIT@k equals to 1 if there is at least one relevant
translation in top k, and 0 otherwise. This mea-
sures the quality of the best translation in top k,
which is the translation the post-editor will ﬁnd
and work on if she reads till the kth place in the
list. HIT@k equals to 1.0 at the end of the list.

We report the mean PREC@k and HIT@k for

all s with the 0.95 conﬁdence interval.

5.5 Experimental Results
In Table 1 we report PREC@k and HIT@k
for k = 1..10. The ranking receives 0.8747
PREC@1, which means that most of the top
ranked translations have at least the same quality
as the top TM output. We notice that precision re-
mains above 0.8 till k = 5, leading us to conclude
that most of the relevant translations are ranked in
the top-5 positions in the list.

Using the HIT@k scores we can further con-
ﬁrm this argument. The HIT@k score grows
steadily from 0.8747 to 0.9941 for k = 1...6, so
most often there will be at least one relevant trans-
lation in top-6 for the post-editor to work with.
After that room for improvement becomes very
small.

In sum, both of the PREC@k scores and the
HIT@k scores show that the ranking model effec-
tively integrates the two translation sources (MT
and TM) into one merged k-best list, and ranks
the relevant translations higher.

To measure whether the ranking model is ef-
fective compared to pure MT or TM outputs, we
report the PREC@k of those outputs in Table 2.
The k-best output used in this table is ranked by
the MT or TM system, without being ranked by
our model. We see the ranked outputs consistently
outperform the MT outputs for all k = 1...5 w.r.t.
precision at a signiﬁcant level, indicating that our
system preserves some high quality hits from the
TM.

The TM outputs alone are generally of much
lower quality than the MT and Ranked outputs, as
is shown by the precision scores for k = 2...5. But

TM translations obtain 1.0 PREC@1 according to
the deﬁnition of the PREC calculation. Note that
it does not mean that those outputs will need less
post-editing (cf. Section 6.1), but rather indicates
that each one of these outputs meet the lowest ac-
ceptable criterion to be relevant.

6 Analysis of Post-Editing Effort
A natural question follows the PREC and HIT
numbers: after reading the ranked k-best list, will
the post-editors edit less than they would have to if
they did not have access to the list? This question
would be best answered by human post-editors in
a large-scale experimental setting. As we have not
yet conducted a manual post-editing experiment,
we try to measure the post-editing effort implied
by our model with the edit statistics captured by
the TER metric, sorted into four types: Insertion,
Substitution, Deletion and Shift. We report the av-
erage number of edits incurred along with the 0.95
conﬁdence interval.

6.1 Top-1 Edit Statistics
We report the results on the 1-best output of TM,
MT and our ranking system in Table 3.

In the single best results, it is easy to see that
the 1-best output from the MT system requires
the least post-editing effort. This is not surpris-
ing given the distribution of the gold standard in
Section 5.3, where most MT outputs are of better
quality than the TM hits.

Moreover, since TM translations are generally
of much lower quality as is indicated by the num-
bers in Table 3 (e.g.
2x as many substitutions
and 3x as many deletions compared to MT), un-
justly including very few of them in the ranking
output will increase loss in the edit statistics. This
explains why the ranking model has better rank-
ing precision in Tables 1 and 2, but seems to in-
cur more edit efforts. However, in practice post-
editors can neglect an obvious ‘bad’ translation
very quickly.

6.2 Top-k Edit Statistics
We report edit statistics of the Top-3 and Top-5
outputs in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. For each
system we report two sets of statistics: the Best-
statistics calculated on the best output (according

to TER score) in the list, and the Mean- statistics
calculated on the whole Top-k list.

The Mean- numbers allow us to have a general
overview of the ranking quality, but it is strongly
inﬂuenced by the poor TM hits that can easily be
neglected in practice. To control the impact of
those TM hits, we rely on the Best- numbers to es-
timate the edits performed on the translations that
are more likely to be used by post-editors.

In Table 4, the ranking output’s edit statistics
is closer to the MT output than the Top-1 case
in Table 3. Table 5 continues this tendency, in
which the Best-in-Top5 Ranking output requires
marginally less Substitution and Deletion opera-
tions and signiﬁcantly less Insertion and Shift op-
erations (starred) than its MT counterpart. This
shows that when more of the list is explored, the
advantage of the ranking model – utilizing mul-
tiple translation sources – begins to compensate
for the possible large number of edits required by
poor TM hits and ﬁnally leads to reduced post-
editing effort.

There are several explanations to why the rel-
ative performance of the ranking model improves
when k increases, as compared to other models.
The most obvious explanation is that a single poor
translation is less likely to hurt edit statistics on
a k-best list with large k, if most of the transla-
tions in the k-best list are of good quality. We see
from Tables 1 and 2 that the ranking output is of
better quality than the MT and TM outputs w.r.t.
precision. For a larger k, the small number of in-
correctly ranked translations are less likely to be
chosen as the Best- translation and hold back the
Best- numbers.

A further reason is related to our ranking model
which optimizes on Kendall’s τ score. Accord-
ingly the output might not be optimal when we
evaluate the Top-1 output, but will behave better
when we evaluate on the list. This is also in ac-
cordance with our aim, which is to enrich the TM

with MT outputs and help the post-editor, instead
of choosing the translation for the post-editor.

6.3 Comparing the MT, TM and Ranking

Outputs

One of the interesting ﬁndings from Tables 3 and
4 is that according to the TER edit statistics, the
MT outputs generally need a smaller number of
edits than the TM and Ranking outputs. This cer-
tainly conﬁrms the necessity to integrate MT into
today’s TM systems.

However, this fact should not lead to the con-
clusion that TMs should be replaced by MT com-
pletely. First of all, all of our experiments exclude
exact TM matches, as those translations will sim-
ply be reused and not translated. While this is a
realistic setting in the translation industry, it re-
moves all sentences for which the TM works best
from our evaluations.

Furthermore, Table 5 shows that the Best-in-
Top5 Ranking output performs better than the MT
outputs, hence there are TM outputs that lead to
smaller number of edits. As k increases, the rank-
ing model is able to better utilize these outputs.

Finally, in this task we concentrate on rank-
ing useful translations higher, but we are not in-
terested in how useless translations are ranked.
Ranking SVM optimizes on the ranking of the
whole list, which is slightly different from what
we actually require. One option is to use other
optimization techniques that can make use of this
property to get better Top-k edit statistics for a
smaller k. Another option is obviously to perform
regression directly on the number of edits instead
of modeling on the ranking. We plan to explore
these ideas in future work.

7 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we present a novel ranking-based
model to integrate SMT into a TM system, in or-
der to facilitate the work of post-editors. In such

a model, the user of the TM will be presented
with an augmented k-best list, consisting of trans-
lations from both the TM and the MT systems, and
ranked according to ascending prospective post-
editing effort.

From the post-editors’ point of view, the TM
remains intact. And unlike in the binary transla-
tion recommendation, where only one translation
recommendation is provided, the ranking model
offers k-best post-editing candidates, enabling the
user to use more resources when translating. As
we do not actually throw away any translation pro-
duced from the TM, the assets represented by the
TM are preserved and the related estimation of the
upper bound cost is still valid.

We extract system independent features from
the MT and TM outputs and use Ranking SVMs to
train the ranking model, which outperforms both
the TM’s and MT’s k-best list w.r.t. precision at k,
for all ks.

We also analyze the edit statistics of the inte-
grated k-best output using the TER edit statistics.
Our ranking model results in slightly increased
number of edits compared to the MT output (ap-
parently held back by a small number of poor TM
outputs that are ranked high) for a smaller k, but
requires less edits than both the MT and the TM
output for a larger k.

This work can be extended in a number of ways.
Most importantly, We plan to conduct a user study
to validate the effectiveness of the method and
to gather HTER scores to train a better ranking
model. Furthermore, we will try to experiment
with learning models that can further reduce the
number of edit operations on the top ranked trans-
lations. We also plan to improve the adaptability
of this method and apply it beyond a speciﬁc do-
main and language pair.
