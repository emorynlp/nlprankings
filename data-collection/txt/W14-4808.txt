1 Introduction 
The NeuroNEO Project (García Palacios et al, 2014) aims to collect and suggest new lexical units in 
close collaboration with specialists in the field and with specialised translators as necessary collabora-
tors and decisive agents in the dissemination of neologisms. Neologisms are a powerful spearhead for 
science and, needless to say, for the language(s) of science.  

Field specialists come in touch with new term creations and concepts both in the process of 
knowledge reception and knowledge production. In both cases, Spanish specialists’ need to conceptu-
alise, verbalise and stabilise the new concepts is often mediated by English as a scientific lingua fran-
ca. This results in a diminished capability of non-English speakers to both apprehend and exploit the 
potential of the new conceptual and linguistic coinages and to cast their own ideas and scientific con-
structions onto functionally adequate linguistic moulds. We acknowledge that science, at least for the 
foreseeable future, will be “created” mostly in English, but contend that it can be enriched and ex-
panded by helping it “speak” other languages through translation from and into English.  

In the first phase of our project we are concentrating on the knowledge-reception process alone. Our 
team of Spanish-speaking language, terminology and translation experts and researchers will be moni-
toring the way neuroscientists cognitively and linguistically cope and deal with conceptual and termi-
nological neologisms when reading recent English articles. To gather this knowledge, we are experi-
menting with the design of a collaborative tool to collect relevant information of the specialists’ en-
counter with neological occurrences. 

2 Defining and detecting neologisms 
Neologisms appear in order to fulfil denominative needs. They challenge a language code, pushing it 
to its limits, but, at the same time, provide the basis for its survival and development (Sánchez Ibáñez, 
2013: 58-65). Linguistic classification of neologisms (e.g. morphosyntactic, semantic, loans, calques) 
would not be beneficial for neuroscientists while processing the scientific information they read, as 
this would detract from their concentration on the subject matter and “contaminate” the ecology of the 
activity, by letting an alien expert domain intrude into their habitual knowledge-reception task. We 
need to provide neuroscientists “ontologically clean” (Winograd and Flores, 1986: 165) linguistic 
means to help them identify and communicate their neological experiences.  

A cognitive-ontological model that has successfully focused on “units of understanding” (rather 
than static, universal terms or concepts), historical determinations, diachronic evolution and domain 
expert participation, is Temmerman’s sociocognitive approach to terminology (2000), which later led 
to “termontography” (see, for instance Temmerman and Kerremans, 2003; Kerremans, 2004). Their

main aim is to bring together the activities of terminography and ontology engineering from a socio-
cognitive perspective, and to provide a conceptual and methodological basis for the development of 
applications for different human and semi-automatic terminology-related endeavours. 

A “termontology” which defines and describes units of understanding in terms of categories (also 
specified as human language phrases), intracategorial aspects and intercategorial relationships in a cat-
egorisation framework (Kerremans, 2004) seems like an excellent idea if we want to empower domain 
experts with a familiar map of knowledge which they can contribute to and which can help us to iden-
tify systemic/viewpoint change leading to nascent neologisms. 

3 Building the interface between field specialists and language experts 
The design of the tool must start with the analysis of the activity where it is to be integrated, the con-
cerns and the commitments of the users/actors, and their conceptual model (Liddle, 1996). It is crucial 
to get as much “practical understanding” (Ehn, 1992: 122-123) of the task that the users will undertake 
and of potential breakdown; to stimulate the task by not interfering too much in it, unencumbered but 
enhanced by the interactive and linguistic scaffolding of our tool. 

The necessary (hopefully minimal but productive) interference with neuroscientists’ cognitive pro-
cess must be compensated for by satisfying other needs they may (consciously or unconsciously) have 
or providing them with a rewarding experience (Hassenzahl, 2010). They must be aware that their par-
ticipation will help science (not only Spanish science) and Spanish as a language of science; at the 
same time, even those who have no linguistic inclinations must find that, by focusing on the way lan-
guage represents and creates reality, the tool can help reinforce, deepen and enhance the understanding 
of the concepts they read and of their potential implications. Ideally, our tool should also become a 
friendly platform for neuroscientists to read and annotate all their articles. 

In order to test what interface, actions, language and workflows could accomplish all this, we will 
turn to prototyping as a fundamental method in Human-Computer Interaction. “The ability to shape 
and reshape software requires a capacity for rapid prototyping – for turning an unarticulated idea into a 
working prototype quickly enough to be able to change it, to listen to it, even to throw it out and to go 
on to another” (Winograd, 1996: 206).  

4 Prototype experiment for expert neologism detection and characterization 
The outline of the experiment is as follows: first, our neuroscientist expert subjects will be assigned a 
recent journal article about some new development in the field in English. The approximate length of 
each unit of cognitive-textual processing should be one page (a section or a number of sections total-
ling that length or thereabouts).  

As they read, subjects are encouraged to highlight what they consider to be key elements of the text 
(mono- or plurilexical terms). Afterwards, they will be required to mark concepts or terms that can be 
considered as new. These new concepts may be expressed through mono- or plurilexical terms, but 
they can also appear in the form of denominative periphrasis or other kinds of non-lexicalised expres-
sions (García Palacios, 2009: 19; Sánchez Ibáñez, 2013: 295-308). A term or expression will be con-
sidered as a neologism if the expert has only been aware of its existence in recent years. 

Once the candidate neologisms are identified, experts will have to decide to what broad category of 
the field of neuroscience the expression identified as new pertains. Then, they will be requested to ex-
plain in Spanish and in their own words the novel aspects discovered in the text. The subjects are ex-
pected to emphasise in what respect (activities, situations, cases...) new aspects could be relevant.  

Finally, experts will have to suggest other terms or categories (both in English and in Spanish) re-
lated to the concept they are describing. This last task is meant to detect categories, conceptual frames 
to which the identified candidate neologism may belong or prototypical characteristics of the concept. 

This first pilot experiment should measure the adequacy of the proposal, and in particular: 

• The most adequate unit of cognitive processing (section, page, paragraph, time). 

• The degree of distortion the experiment imposes on the process of reading, and whether the task 
implies a cognitive overload. 

• To what extent experts are willing to engage in the experiment, whether they find it motivating.

• From a qualitative perspective, which elements experts identify as novel and which not, allow-
ing us to get a feeling of the clues for the identification of new concepts. 

5 Tools for the development of the prototype experiment 
For the practical development of our prototype experiments we are considering to use the upper cate-
gories of the NIFSTD ontology and wikis as a collaborative tool. The availability and suitability for 
our research of the former has been considered in Maroto (2013).  

NIFSTD (NIF Standard) ontology stands out as the most comprehensive ontology of the neurosci-
ences available on the web. Its wide coverage and its degree of normalisation and reusability make this 
ontology particularly suitable for our research purposes. It is composed of several modules, each one 
covering a distinct domain of neuroscience (Bug et al, 2008) and reflecting the semantic domains cov-
ered by NIFSTD: organism taxonomy, molecules, macroscopic anatomy, sub-cellular anatomy, cell, 
nervous system function, nervous system dysfunction, phenotypic qualities and investigation.  

The upper classes of the ontology will be used in our research as “tags” so that experts can catego-
rise neologisms identified during the reception of specialised articles. Therefore, these upper classes 
will shape the initial framework of categories from which our top-down strategy starts, which in turn-
will later be refined thanks to experts’ contributions. 

At this stage, we need to test to what extent the conceptual classes proposed by existing ontologies 
can be used as a valuable tool to help experts categorise new terms and concepts. As our research de-
velops, we might want to integrate our findings within an ontology structure (either NIF’s or our own). 

We also need a collaborative tool for collecting and linking expert knowledge during the experi-
ments. A wiki can be defined as collaborative software that allows different users to develop web sites 
in a simple way using a simplified mark-up language, based on linking interrelated concepts and track-
ing changes. A "wiki is a written-down memory with a lot more space than the built-in one, and it's a 
collective memory, too" (Stafford and Webb 2006). In a wiki "What You Think Is What You Get". 

The main reasons that justify the use of wikis in our experiments are that most scientists are already 
familiar with this kind of software and the fact that wikis are accessible anytime from anywhere with a 
web connection. Besides, every detail about the editing is stored in the wiki, that is, we can later ana-
lyse how much time our experts spent editing, whether they made many or few changes, etc. 

Finally, wikis offer the possibility to "tag" pages and to link concepts. Our experts will be required 
to categorise new terms and/or concepts, that is, to assign one or more cognitive “tags” to the newly 
discovered concept. Neuroscientists will be given a set of proposed tags from the upper level of 
NIFSTD ontology to label their responses to our experiments. In this way the suitability of upper-level 
ontological classes could be tested and, if necessary, the categories could be revised and/or refined. 
 
This contribution presents the theoretical and methodological framework that is the basis of our re-
search. However, a lot of work still lays ahead in order to check the validity of our proposal.
