Abstract

The Genia event task, a bio-molecular event
extraction task, is arranged as one of the main
tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011. As its sec-
ond time to be arranged for community-wide
focused efforts, it aimed to measure the ad-
vance of the community since 2009, and to
evaluate generalization of the technology to
full text papers. After a 3-month system de-
velopment period, 15 teams submitted their
performance results on test cases. The re-
sults show the community has made a sig-
nificant advancement in terms of both perfor-
mance improvement and generalization.

1 Introduction

The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter)
is a series of efforts to promote a community-
wide collaboration towards fine-grained informa-
tion extraction (IE) in biomedical domain. The
first event, BioNLP-ST 2009, introducing a bio-
molecular event (bio-event) extraction task to the
community, attracted a wide attention, with 42 teams
being registered for participation and 24 teams sub-
mitting final results (Kim et al., 2009).
To establish a community effort, the organizers

provided the task definition, benchmark data, and
evaluations, and the participants competed in devel-
oping systems to perform the task. Meanwhile, par-
ticipants and organizers communicated to develop a
better setup of evaluation, and some provided their
tools and resources for other participants, making it
a collaborative competition.

The final results enabled to observe the state-of-
the-art performance of the community on the bio-
event extraction task, which showed that the auto-
matic extraction of simple events - those with unary
arguments, e.g. gene expression, localization, phos-
phorylation - could be achieved at the performance
level of 70% in F-score, but the extraction of com-
plex events, e.g. binding and regulation, was a lot
more challenging, having achieved 40% of perfor-
mance level.
After BioNLP-ST 2009, all the resources from the

event were released to the public, to encourage con-
tinuous efforts for further advancement. Since then,
several improvements have been reported (Miwa et
al., 2010b; Poon and Vanderwende, 2010; Vlachos,
2010; Miwa et al., 2010a; Björne et al., 2010).
For example, Miwa et al. (Miwa et al., 2010b)
reported a significant improvement with binding
events, achieving 50% of performance level.
The task introduced in BioNLP-ST 2009 was re-

named to Genia event (GE) task, and was hosted
again in BioNLP-ST 2011, which also hosted four
other IE tasks and three supporting tasks (Kim et al.,
2011). As the sole task that was repeated in the two
events, the GE task was referenced during the devel-
opment of other tasks, and took the role of connect-
ing the results of the 2009 event to the main tasks of
2011. The GE task in 2011 received final submis-
sions from 15 teams. The results show the commu-
nity made a significant progress with the task, and
also show the technology can be generalized to full
papers at moderate cost of performance.
This paper presents the task setup, preparation,

and discusses the results.

Arguments that may be filled more than once per event are marked with “+”.

2 Task Definition

The GE task follows the task definition of BioNLP-
ST 2009, which is briefly described in this section.
For more detail, please refer to (Kim et al., 2009).
Table 1 shows the event types to be addressed in

the task. For each event type, the primary and sec-
ondary arguments to be extracted with an event are
defined. For example, a Phosphorylation event is
primarily extracted with the protein to be phospho-
rylated. As secondary information, the specific site
to be phosphorylated may be extracted.
From a computational point of view, the event

types represent different levels of complexity. When
only primary arguments are considered, the first five
event types in Table 1 are classified as simple event
types, requiring only unary arguments. The Bind-
ing and Regulation types are more complex: Bind-
ing requires detection of an arbitrary number of ar-
guments, and Regulation requires detection of recur-
sive event structure.
Based on the definition of event types, the entire

task is divided to three sub-tasks addressing event
extraction at different levels of specificity:

Task 1. Core event extraction addresses the ex-
traction of typed events together with their pri-
mary arguments.

Task 2. Event enrichment addresses the extrac-
tion of secondary arguments that further spec-
ify the events extracted in Task 1.

Task 3. Negation/Speculation detection
addresses the detection of negations and
speculations over the extracted events.

Task 1 serves as the backbone of the GE task and is
mandatory for all participants, while the other two
are optional.

Figure 1: Event annotation example

Figure 1 shows an example of event annotation.
The event encoded in the text is represented in a
standoff-style annotation as follows:
T1 Protein 15 18
T2 Localization 19 32
T3 Entity 40 46
E1 Localization:T2 Theme:T1 ToLoc:T1
M1 Negation E1

The annotation T1 identifies the entity referred
to by the string (p65) between the character offsets,
15 and 18 to be a Protein. T2 identifies the string,
translocation, to refer to a Localization event. Enti-
ties other than proteins or event type references are
classified into a default class Entity, as in T3. E1
then represents the event defined by the three enti-
ties, as defined in Table 1. Note that for Task 1, the
entity, T3, does not need to be identified, and the
event, E1, may be identified without specification of
the secondary argument, ToLoc:T1:
E1’ Localization:T2 Theme:T1

Finding the full representation of E1 is the goal of
Task 2. In the example, the localization event, E1,
is negated as expressed in the failure of . Finding the
negation, M1 is the goal of Task 3.

3 Data preparation

The data sets are prepared in two collections: the
abstract and the full text collections. The abstract
collection includes the same data used for BioNLP-
ST 2009, and is meant to be used to measure the
progress of the community. The full text collection
includes full papers which are newly annotated, and
is meant to be used to measure the generalization
of the technology to full papers. Table 2 shows the
statistics of the annotations in the GE task data sets.
Since the training data from the full text collection is
relatively small despite of the expected rich variety
of expressions in full text, it is expected that ‘gener-
alization’ of a model from the abstract collection to
full papers would be a key technique to get a reason-
able performance.
A full paper consists of several sections includ-

ing the title, abstract, introduction, results, conclu-
sion, methods, and so on. Different sections would
be written with different purposes, which may af-
fect the type of information that are found in the sec-
tions. Table 3 shows the distribution of annotations
in different sections. It indicates that event men-
tions, according to the event definition in Table 1, in
Methods and Captions are much less frequent than
in the other TIAB, Intro. and R/D/C sections. Fig-
ure 2 illustrates the different distribution of anno-
tated event types in the five sections. It is notable
that the Methods section (depicted in blue) shows
very different distribution compared to others: while

Figure 2: Event distribution in different sections

Regulation and Positive regulation events are not as
frequent as in other sections, Negative regulation is
relatively much more frequent. It may agree with
an intuition that experimental devices, which will be
explained in Methods sections, often consists of ar-
tificial processes that are designed to cause a nega-
tive regulatory effect, e.g. mutation, addition of in-
hibitor proteins, etc. This observation suggests a dif-
ferent event annotation scheme, or a different event
extraction strategy would be required for Methods
sections.

4 Participation

In total, 15 teams submitted final results. All 15
teams participated in the mandatory Task 1, four
teams in Task 2, and two teams in Task 3. Only one
team, UTurku, completed all the three tasks.
Table 4 shows the profile of the teams, except-

ing three who chose to remain anonymous. A brief
examination on the team organization (the People
column) suggests the importance of a computer sci-
ence background, C and BI, to perform the GE task,
which agrees with the same observation made in
2009. It is interpreted as follows: the role of com-
puter scientists may be emphasized in part due to
the fact that the task requires complex computational
modeling, demanding particular efforts in frame-
work design and implementation and computational
resources. The ’09 column suggests that previous
experience in the task may have affected to the per-
formance of the teams, especially in a complex task
like the GE task.
Table 5 shows the profile of the systems. A

notable observation is that four teams developed
their systems based on the model of UTurku09
(Björne et al., 2009) which was the winning sys-

tem of BioNLP-ST 2009. It may show an influence
of the BioNLP-ST series in the task. For syntac-
tic analyses, the prevailing use of Charniak John-
son re-ranking parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005)
using the self-trained biomedical model from Mc-
Closky (2008) (McCCJ) which is converted to Stan-
ford Dependency (de Marneffe et al., 2006) is no-
table, which may also be an influence from the re-
sults of BioNLP-ST 2009. The last two teams,
XABioNLP and HCMUS, who did not use syntactic
analyses could not get a performance comparable to
the others, which may suggest the importance of us-
ing syntactic analyses for a complex IE task like GE
task.

an impressive improvement with Binding events
(44.41%→52.62%).

The best performance in Task 1 this time is
achieved by the FAUST system, which adopts a
combination model of UMass and Stanford. Its
performance on the abstract collection, 56.04%,
demonstrates a significant improvement of the com-
munity in the repeated GE task, when compared to
both UTurku09, 51.95% and Miwa10, 53.29%.
The biggest improvement is made to the Regulation
events (40.11%→46.97%) which requires a com-
plex modeling for recursive event structure - an
event may become an argument of another event.
The second ranked system, UMass, shows the best
performance on the full paper collection. It suggests
that what FAUST obtained from the model combi-

nation might be a better optimization to abstracts.
The ConcordU system is notable as it is the sole

rule-based system that is ranked above the average.
It shows a performance optimized for precision with
relatively low recall. The same tendency is roughly
replicated by other rule-based systems, CCP-BTMG,
TM-SCS, XABioNLP, and HCMUS. It suggests that
a rule-based system might not be a good choice if a
high coverage is desired. However, the performance
of ConcordU for simple events suggests that a high
precision can be achieved by a rule based system
with a modest loss of recall. It might be more true
when the task is less complex.
This time, three teams achieved better results than

Miwa10, which indicates some role of focused ef-
forts like BioNLP-ST. The comparison between the

11



performance on abstract and full paper collections
shows that generalization to full papers is feasible
with very modest loss in performance.

5.2 Task 2

Tables 7 shows final evaluation results of Task 2.
For reference, the reported performance of the task-
winning system in 2009, UT+DBCLS09 (Riedel et
al., 2009), is shown in the top. The first and second
ranked system, FAUST and UMass, which share a
same author with Riedel09, made a significant
improvement over Riedel09 in the abstract col-
lection. UTurku achieved the best performance in
finding sites arguments but did not produce location
arguments. In table 7, the performance of all the
systems in full text collection suggests that finding
secondary arguments in full text is much more chal-
lenging.
In detail, a significant improvement was made for

Location arguments (36.59%→50.00%). A further
breakdown of the results of site extraction, shown
in table 8, shows that finding site arguments for
Phosphorylation, Binding and Regulation events are
all significantly improved, but in different ways.
The extraction of protein sites to be phosphory-
lated is approaching a practical level of performance
(84.21%), while protein sites to be bound or to be
regulated remains challenging to be extracted.

5.3 Task 3

Table 9 shows final evaluation results of Task 3.
For reference, the reported performance of the task-
winning system in 2009, Kilicoglu09(Kilicoglu
and Bergler, 2009), is shown in the top. Among the
two teams participated in the task, UTurku showed
a better performance in extracting negated events,
while ConcordU showed a better performance in
extracting speculated events.

6 Conclusions

The Genia event task which was repeated for
BioNLP-ST 2009 and 2011 took a role of measur-
ing the progress of the community and generaliza-
tion IE technology to full papers. The results from
15 teams who made their final submissions to the
task show that a clear advance of the community in
terms of the performance on a focused domain and

also generalization to full papers. To our disappoint-
ment, however, an effective use of supporting task
results was not observed, which thus remains as fu-
ture work for further improvement.
