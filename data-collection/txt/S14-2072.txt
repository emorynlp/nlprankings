Abstract

We describe UMBC’s systems developed
for the SemEval 2014 tasks on Multi-
lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (Task
10) and Cross-Level Semantic Similarity
(Task 3). Our best submission in the
Multilingual task ranked second in both
English and Spanish subtasks using an
unsupervised approach. Our best sys-
tems for Cross-Level task ranked second
in Paragraph-Sentence and first in both
Sentence-Phrase and Word-Sense subtask.
The system ranked first for the Phrase-
Word subtask but was not included in the
official results due to a late submission.

1 Introduction

We describe the semantic text similarity systems
we developed for two of the SemEval tasks for the
2014 International Workshop on Semantic Evalu-
ation. We developed systems for task 3, Cross-
Level Semantic Similarity (Jurgens et al., 2014),
and task 10, Multilingual Semantic Textual Simi-
larity (Agirre et al., 2014). A key component in
all the systems was an enhanced version of the
word similarity system used in our entry (Han et
al., 2013b) in the 2013 SemEval Semantic Textual
Similarity task.

Our best system in the Multilingual Semantic
Textual Similarity task used an unsupervised ap-
proach and ranked second in both the English and
Spanish subtasks. In the Cross-Level Semantic
Similarity task we developed a number of new al-
gorithms and used new linguistic data resources.
In this task, our best systems ranked second in
the Paragraph-Sentence task, first in the Sentence-
Phrase task and first in the Word-Sense task. The

system ranked first for the Phrase-Word task but
was not included in the official results due to a late
submission.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows.
Section 2 describes our word similarity model and
it’s wrapper to deal with named entities and out
of vocabulary words. Sections 3 and 4 describe
how we extended the word similarity model for
the specific tasks. Section 5 presents the results
we achieved on these tasks along with instances
where the system failed. Section 6 highlights our
future plans for improving the system.

2 Semantic Word Similarity Model

2.1 LSA Word Similarity Model

Our word similarity model is a revised version of
the one we used in the 2013 *SEM semantic text
similarity task. This was in turn derived from
a system developed for the Graph of Relations
project (UMBC, 2013b). For SemEval, we wanted
a measure that considered a word’s semantics but
not its lexical category, e.g., the verb “marry”
should be semantically similar to the noun “wife”.
An online demonstration of a similar model de-
veloped for the GOR project is available (UMBC,
2013a), but it lacks some of this version’s features.

LSA-based word similarity. LSA Word Simi-
larity relies on the distributional hypothesis that
words occurring in the same context tend to have
similar meanings (Harris, 1968). LSA relies on the
fact that words that are semantically similar (e.g.,
cat and feline or nurse and doctor) are more likely
to occur near one another in text. Thus evidence
for word similarity can be computed from a statis-
tical analysis of a large text corpus.

We extracted raw word co-occurrence statis-
tics from a portion of the 2007 crawl of the Web
corpus from the Stanford WebBase project (Stan-
ford, 2001). We processed the collection to re-
move some undesirable elements (text duplica-

tions, truncated text, non-English text and strange
characters) and produced a three billion word cor-
pus of high quality English, which is available on-
line (Han and Finin, 2013).

We performed POS tagging and lemmatiza-
tion on the corpus using the Stanford POS tag-
ger (Toutanova et al., 2000). Word/term co-
occurrences were counted in a moving window
of a fixed size that scans the entire corpus. We
generated two co-occurrence models using win-
dow sizes ±1 and ±4 because we observed differ-
ent natures of the models. ±1 window produces
a context similar to the dependency context used
in (Lin, 1998). It provides a more precise con-
text but is only good for comparing words within
the same POS. This is because words of different
POS are typically surrounded by words in differ-
ent syntactic forms. In contrast, a context window
of ±4 words allows us to compute semantic simi-
larity between words with different POS.

Examples from our LSA similarity model are
given in Table 1. Pairs 1 to 6 illustrate that the
measure has a good property of differentiating
similar words from non-similar words. Examples
7 and 8 show that the ±4 model can detect se-
mantically similar words even with different POS
while the ±1 model yields poor results. The pairs
in 9 and 10 show that highly related, but not sub-
stitutable, words may have a strong similarity and
that the ±1 model is better at detecting them.

Our word co-occurrence models were based on
a predefined vocabulary of more than 22,000 com-
mon English words and noun phrases. We also
added to it more than 2,000 verb phrases extracted
from WordNet. The final dimensions of our word
co-occurrence matrices are 29,000× 29,000 when
words are POS tagged. Our vocabulary includes
only open-class words, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjec-

tives and adverbs. There are no proper nouns in
the vocabulary with the only exception of country
names.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been
found to be effective in improving word similar-
ity measures (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). SVD
is typically applied to a word by document matrix,
yielding the familiar LSA technique. In our case,
we apply it to our word by word matrix (Burgess et
al., 1998). Before performing SVD, we transform
the raw word co-occurrence count fij to its log fre-
quency log(fij +1). We select the 300 largest sin-
gular values and reduce the 29K word vectors to
300 dimensions. The LSA similarity between two
words is defined as the cosine similarity of their
corresponding word vectors after the SVD trans-
formation. See (Han et al., 2013b; Lushan Han,
2014) for examples and more information on the
LSA model.

Statistical word similarity measures have limi-
tations. Related words can have similarity scores
as high as what similar words get, e.g., “doctor”
and “hospital”. Word similarity is typically low
for synonyms that have many word senses since
information about different senses are mashed to-
gether (Han et al., 2013a). To address these issues,
we augment the similarity between two words us-
ing knowledge from WordNet, for example, in-
creasing the score if they are in the same WordNet
synset or if one is a direct or two link hypernym
of the other. See (Han et al., 2013b) for further
details.

2.2 Word Similarity Wrapper
Our word similarity model is restricted to the vo-
cabulary size which only comprises open class
words. For words outside of the vocabulary, we
can only rely on their lexical features and deter-
mine equivalence (which we score as 0 or 1, since
a continuous scale makes little sense in this sce-
nario). An analysis of the previous STS datasets
show that out-of-vocabulary words account for
about 25 − 45% of the total words. Datasets like
MSRpar and headlines lie on the higher end of this
spectrum due to the high volume of proper nouns.

In the previous version, we computed a charac-
ter bigram overlap score given by

characterBigramScore =
|A ∩B|
|A ∪B|

where A and B are the set of bigrams from the first
and second word respectively. We compare this

417



against a preset threshold (0.8) to determine equiv-
alence. While this is reasonable for named enti-
ties, it is not the best approach for other classes.

Named Entities. The wrapper is extended to
handle all classes of named entities that are in-
cluded in Stanford CoreNLP (Finkel et al., 2005).
We use heuristic rules to compute the similarity
between two numbers or two dates. To handle
named entity mentions of people, locations and or-
ganizations, we supplement our character bigram
overlap method with the DBpedia Lookup service
(Mendes et al., 2011). For each entity mention, we
select the DBpedia entity with the most inlinks,
which serves as a good estimate of popularity or
significance (Syed et al., 2010). If the two named
entity mentions map to identical DBpedia entities,
we lower our character bigram overlap threshold
to 0.6.

OOV words. As mentioned earlier, when deal-
ing with out-of-vocabulary words, we only have
its lexical features. A straightforward approach is
to simply get more context for the word. Since
our vocabulary is limited, we need to use external
dictionaries to find the word. For our system, we
use Wordnik (Davidson, 2013), which is a compi-
lation of several dictionaries including The Amer-
ican Heritage Dictionary, Wikitionary and Word-
Net. Wordnik provides a REST API to access sev-
eral attributes for a given word such as it’s defini-
tions, examples, related words etc. For out of vo-
cabulary words, we simply retrieve the word pair’s
top definitions and supply it to our existing STS
system (UMBC, 2013a) to compute its similarity.
As a fallback, in case the word is absent even in
Wordnik, we resort to our character bigram over-
lap measure.

3 Multilingual Semantic Text Similarity

3.1 English STS
For the 2014 STS-English subtask we submitted
three runs. They all used a simple term alignment
strategy to compute sentence similarities. The first
run was an unsupervised approach that used the
basic word-similarity model for term alignment.
The next two used a supervised approach to com-
bine the scores from the first run with alignment
scores using the enhanced word-similarity wrap-
per. The two runs differed in their training.

Align and Penalize Approach. The pairingWord
run was produced by the same Align-and-Penalize

system (Han et al., 2013b) that we used in the
2013 STS task with only minor changes. The
biggest change is that we included a small list
of disjoint concepts (Han et al., 2013b) that are
used in the penalization phase, such as {piano, vi-
olin} and {dog, cat}. The disjoint concepts were
manually collected from the MSRvid dataset pro-
vided by the 2012 STS task because we still lack a
reliable general method to automatically produce
them. The list only contains 23 pairs, which can
be downloaded at (dis, 2014).

We also slightly adjusted our stopword list.
We removed a few words that appear in the trial
datasets of 2013 STS task (e.g., frame) but we did
not add any new stopwords for this year’s task. All
the changes are small and we made them only in
the hope that they can slightly improve our system.

Unlike machine learning methods that require
manually selecting an appropriate trained model
for a particular test dataset, our unsupervised
Align-and-Penalize system is applied uniformly
to all six test datasets in 2014 STS task, namely,
deft-forum, deft-news, headlines, images, OnWN
and tweet-news. It achieves the second best rank
among all submitted runs.

Supervised Machine Learning. Our second and
third runs used machine learning approaches sim-
ilar to those we developed for the 2013 STS task
but with significant changes in both pre-processing
and the features extracted.

The most significant pre-processing change was
the use of Stanford coreNLP (Finkel et al., 2005)
tool for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging and
identifying named entity mentions. For the tweet-
news dataset we also removed the hashtag symbol
(‘#’) prior to applying the Stanford tools. We use
only open class words and named entity mentions
and remove all other tokens.

We align tokens between two sentences based
on the updated word similarity wrapper that was
described in Section 2.2. We use information
content from Google word frequencies for word
weights similar to our approach last year. The
alignment process is a many-to-one mapping sim-
ilar to the Align and Penalize approach and two
tokens are only aligned if their similarity is greater
than 0.1. The sentence similarity score is then
computed as the average of the scores of their
aligned tokens. This score, along with the Align
and Penalize approach score, are used as features
to train support vector regression (SVR) models.

418



We use an epsilon SVR with a radial basis kernel
function and use a grid search to get the optimal
parameter values for cost, gamma and epsilon. We
use datasets from the previous STS tasks as train-
ing data and the two submitted runs differ in the
choice of their training data.

The first approach, named Hulk, is an attempt
to use a generic model trained on a large data set.
The SVR model uses a total of 3750 sentence pairs
(1500 from MSRvid, 1500 from MSRpar and 750
from headlines) for training. Datasets like SMT
were excluded due to poor quality.

The second approach, named Super Saiyan,
is an attempt at domain specific training. For
OnWN, we used 1361 sentence pairs from previ-
ous OnWN dataset. For Images, we used 1500
sentence pairs from MSRvid dataset. The others
lacked any domain specific training data so we
used a generic training dataset comprising 5111
sentence pairs from MSRvid, MSRpar, headlines
and OnWN datasets.

3.2 Spanish STS
As a base-line for this task we first considered
translating the Spanish sentences to English and
running the same systems explained for the En-
glish Subtask (i.e., pairingWord and Hulk). The
results obtained applying this approach to the pro-
vided training data gave a correlation of 0.777 so,
we selected this approach (with some improve-
ments) for the competition.

Translating the sentences. For the automatic
translation of the sentences from Spanish to En-
glish we used the Google Translate API1, a
free, multilingual machine-translation product by
Google. Google Translate presents very accurate
translations for European languages by using sta-
tistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990)
where the translations are generated on the basis of
statistical models derived from bilingual text cor-
pora. In fact, Google used as part of this corpora
200 billion words from United Nations documents
that are typically published in all six official UN
languages, including English and Spanish.

In the experiments performed with the trial data
we manually evaluated the quality of the trans-
lations (one of the authors is a native Spanish
speaker). The overall translation was very accu-
rate but some statistical anomalies, incorrect trans-
lations due to the abundance of a specific sense of

land along the border of these.

Spanish sentence I1.

a word in the training set, appeared.
On one hand, some homonym words are

wrongly translated. For example, the Spanish sen-
tence “Las costas o costa de un mar [...]” was
translated to “Costs or the cost of a sea [...]”.
The Spanish word costa has two different senses:
“coast” (the shore of a sea or ocean) and “‘cost”
(the property of having material worth). On the
other hand, some words are translated preserving
their semantics but with a slightly different mean-
ing. For example, the Spanish sentence “Un cojı́n
es una funda de tela [...]” was correctly translated
to “A cushion is a fabric cover [...]”. However,
the Spanish sentence “Una almohada es un cojı́n
en forma rectangular [...]” was translated to “A
pillow is a rectangular pad [...]”2.

Dealing with statistical anomalies. The afore-
mentioned problem of statistical machine transla-
tion caused a slightly adverse effect when comput-
ing the similarity of two English (translated from
Spanish) sentences with the systems explained in
Section 3.1. Therefore, we improved the direct
translation approach by taking into account the
different possible translations for each word in a
Spanish sentence. For that, our system used the in-
formation provided by the Google Translate API,
that is, all the possible translations for every word
of the sentence along with a popularity value. For
each Spanish sentence the system generates all its
possible translations by combining the different
possible translations of each word. For example,
Figure 1 shows three of the English sentences gen-
erated for a given Spanish sentence from the trial
data.

As a way of controlling the combinatorial ex-
plosion of this step, especially for long sentences,
we limited the maximum number of generated

2Notice that both Spanish sentences used the term cojı́n
that should be translated as cushion (the Spanish word for
pad is almohadilla).

419



sentences for each Spanish sentence to 20 and
we only selected words with a popularity greater
than 65. We arrived at the popularity threshold
through experimentation on every sentence in the
trial data set. After this filtering, our input for
the “news” and “wikipedia” tests went from 480
and 324 pairs of sentences to 5756 and 1776 pairs,
respectively.

Given a pair of Spanish sentences, I1
and I2, and the set of possible translations
generated by our system for each sentence,
TI1 = {T11, T12, T13, . . . , T1n} and TI2 =
{T21, T22, . . . , T2m}, we compute the similarity
between them by using the following formula:

SimSPA(I1, I2) =

n∑
i=1

m∑
j=1

SimENG(T1i, T2j)

n ∗m

where SimENG(x, y) computes the similarity of
two English sentences using our existing STS sys-
tem (Han et al., 2013b).

For the final competition we submitted three
runs. The first (Pairing in Table 3) used the
pairingWord system with the direct translation of
the Spanish sentences to English. The second
run (PairingAvg in Table 3) used the formula for
SimSPA(x, y) based on SimENG(x, y) with
the pairingWord system. Finally, the third one
(Hulk in Table 3) used the Hulk system with the
direct translation.

4 Cross Level Similarity

4.1 Sentence to Paragraph/Phrase

We used the three systems developed for the En-
glish sentence similarity subtask and described in
Section 3.1 for both the sentence to paragraph and
sentence to phrase subtasks, producing three runs.
The model for Hulk remained the same (trained
on 3750 sentence pairs from MSRvid, MSRpar
and headlines dataset) but the SuperSaiyan sys-
tem, which is the domain specific approach, used
the given train and trial text pairs (about 530) for
the respective subtasks as training to generate task
specific models.

4.2 Phrase to Word

In our initial experiments, we directly computed
the phrase-word pair similarity using our English
STS. This yielded a very low correlation of 0.239
for the training set, primarily due to the absence of
these phrases and words in our vocabulary. To ad-
dress this issue, we used external sources to obtain

more contextual information and extracted several
features.

Dictionary features. We used Wordnik as a dic-
tionary resource and retrieved definitions and us-
age examples for the word. We then used our
English STS system to measure the similarity be-
tween these and the given phrase to extract two
features.

Web search features. These features were based
on the hypothesis that if a word and phrase have
similar meanings, then a web search that combines
the word and phrase should return similar docu-
ments when compared to a web search for each
individually.

We implemented this idea by comparing results
of three search queries: the word alone, the phrase
alone, and the word and phrase together.

Using the Bing Search API (BIN, 2014), we re-
trieved the top five results for each search, indexed
them with Lucene (Hatcher et al., 2004), and ex-
tracted term frequency vectors for each of the three
search result document sets. For the phrase ’spill
the beans’ and word ’confess’, for example, we
built a Lucene index for the set of documents re-
trieved by a Bing search for ’spill the beans’, ’con-
fess’, and ’spill the beans confess’. We calculated
the similarity of pairs of search result sets using
the cosine similarity (1) of their term frequency
vectors.

CosineSimilarity =

n∑
i=1

V 1i × V 2i√
n∑

i=1

(V 1i)2 ×
√

n∑
i=1

(V 2i)2
(1)

We calculated the mean and minimum sim-
ilarity of pairs of results for the phrase and
phrase+word searches. These features were ex-
tracted from the provided training set and used in
conjunction with the dictionary features to train
an SVM regression model to predict similarity
scores.

We observed this method can be problematic
when a word or phrase has multiple meanings.
For example, ’spill the beans’ relates to ’confess-
ing’ but it is also the name of a coffee shop and
a soup shop. A mix of these pages do get re-
turned by Bing and reduces the accuracy of our re-
sults. However, we found that this technique often
strengthens evidence of similarity enough that it
improves our overall accuracy when used in com-
bination with our dictionary features.

Figure 2: The WordNet sense for Dante#n#1 and
the three author#n senses.

4.3 Word to Sense

For this subtask, we used external resources to re-
trieve more contextual information. For a given
word, we retrieved its synonym set from WordNet
along with their corresponding definitions. We re-
trieved the WordNet definition for the word sense
as well. For example, given a word-sense pair
(author#n, Dante#n#1), we retrieved the synset of
author#n (writer.n.01, generator.n.03, author.v.01)
along with their WordNet definitions and the sense
definition of Dante#n#1. Figure 2 shows the
WordNet data for this example.

By pairing every combination of the word’s
synset and their corresponding definitions with the
sense’s surface form and definition, we created
four features. For each feature, we used our En-
glish STS system to compare their semantic sim-
ilarity and kept the maximum score as feature’s
value.

We found that about 10% of the training
dataset’s words fell outside of WordNet’s vocab-
ulary. Examples of missing words included many
informal or “slang” words like kegger, crackberry
and post-season. To address this, we used Word-
nik to retrieve the word’s top definition and com-
puted its similarity with the sense. This reduced
the out-of-vocabulary words to about 2% for the
training data. Wordnik thus gave us two addi-
tional features: the maximum semantic similarity
score of word-sense using Wordnik’s additional
definitions for all words and for just the out-of-
vocabulary words. We used these features to train
an SVM regression model with the provided train-
ing set to predict similarity scores.

5 Results

Multilingual Semantic Text Similarity. Table
2 shows the system performance for the English
STS task. Our best performing system ranked
second 3, behind first place by only 0.0005.
It employs an unsupervised approach with no
training data required. The supervised systems
that handled named entity recognition and out-
of-vocabulary words performed slightly better on
datasets in the news domain but still suffered from
noise due to diverse training datasets.

Table 3 shows the performance for the Spanish
subtask. The best run achieved a weighted correla-
tion of 0.804, behind first place by only 0.003. The
Hulk system was similar to the Pairing run and
used only one translation per sentence. The per-
formance boost could be attributed to large num-
ber of named entities in the News and Wikipedia
datasets.

Cross Level Similarity. Table 4 shows our per-
formance in the Cross Level Similarity tasks. The
Paragraph-Sentence and Sentence-Phrase yielded
good results (ranked second and first respectively)
with our English STS system because of sufficient
amount of textual information. The correlation
scores dropped as the granularity level of the text
got finer.

The Phrase-Word run achieved a correlation of
0.457, the highest for the subtask. However, an
incorrect file was submitted prior to the deadline

3An incorrect file for ‘deft-forum’ dataset was submitted.
The correct version had a correlation of 0.4896 instead of
0.4710. This would have placed it at rank 1 overall.

which meant that this was not included in the of-
ficial results. Figure 3 shows the average error
(measured as the average deviation from the gold
standard) across different categories for phrase to
word subtask. Our performance is slightly worse
for slang and idiomatic categories when compared
to others which is due to two reasons: (i) the se-
mantics of idioms is not compositional, reducing
the effectiveness of a distributional similarity mea-
sure and (ii) dictionary-based features often failed
to find definitions and/or examples of idioms. Ta-
ble 5 shows some of the words where our algo-
rithm performed poorly and their scores for indi-
vidual features.

The Word-Sense run ranked first in the sub-
task with a correlation score of 0.389. Table 6
shows some of the word-sense pairs where the
system performed poorly. Our system only used
Wordnik’s top definition which was not always the
right one to use to detect the similarity. For ex-
ample, the first definition of cheese#n is “a solid
food prepared from the pressed curd of milk” but
there is a latter, less prominent one, which is

“money”. A second problem is that some words,
like wasteoid#n, were absent even in Wordnik.

Using additional online lexical resources to in-
clude more slangs and idioms, like the Urban Dic-
tionary (Urb, 2014), could address these issues.
However, care must be taken since the quality of
some content is questionable. For example, the
Urban Dictionary’s first definition of “program-
mer” is “An organism capable of converting caf-
feine into code”.

6 Conclusion

We described our submissions to the Multilingual
Semantic Textual Similarity (Task 10) and Cross-
Level Semantic Similarity (Task 3) tasks for the
2014 International Workshop on Semantic Eval-
uation. Our best runs ranked second in both En-
glish and Spanish subtasks for Task 10 while rank-
ing first in Sentence-Phrase, Phrase-Word, Word-
Sense tasks and second in Paragraph-Sentence
subtasks for Task 3. Our success is attributed to
a powerful word similarity model based on LSA
word similarity and WordNet knowledge. We
used new linguistic resources like Wordnik to im-
prove our existing system for the Phrase-Word and
Word-Sense tasks and plan to include other re-
sources like “Urban dictionary” in the future.
