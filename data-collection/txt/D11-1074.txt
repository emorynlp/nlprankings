Abstract

In this paper we present a novel approach
to entity linking based on a statistical lan-
guage model-based information retrieval with
query expansion. We use both local con-
texts and global world knowledge to expand
query language models. We place a strong
emphasis on named entities in the local con-
texts and explore a positional language model
to weigh them differently based on their dis-
tances to the query. Our experiments on
the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incor-
porating such contextual information indeed
aids in disambiguating the named entities and
consistently improves the entity linking per-
formance. Compared with the official re-
sults from KBP 2010 participants, our system
shows competitive performance.

1 Introduction

When people read news articles, Web pages and
other documents online, they may encounter named
entities which they are not familiar with and there-
fore would like to look them up in an encyclope-
dia. It would be very useful if these entities could be
automatically linked to their corresponding encyclo-
pedic entries. This task of linking mentions of enti-
ties within specific contexts to their corresponding
entries in an existing knowledge base is called en-
tity linking and has been proposed and studied in the
Knowledge Base Population (KBP) track of the Text
Analysis Conference (TAC) (McNamee and Dang,
2009). Besides improving an online surfer’s brows-
ing experience, entity linking also has potential us-

age in many other applications such as normalizing
entity mentions for information extraction.

The major challenge of entity linking is to resolve
name ambiguities. There are generally two types of
ambiguities: (1) Polysemy: This type of ambigu-
ities refers to the case when more than one entity
shares the same name. E.g. George Bush may re-
fer to the 41st President of the U.S., the 43rd Presi-
dent of the U.S., or any other individual who has the
same name. Clearly polysemous names cause diffi-
culties for entity linking. (2) Synonymy: This type
of ambiguities refers to the case when more than
one name variation refers to the same entity. E.g.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is often abbreviated as
MGM. Synonymy affects entity linking when the en-
tity mention in the document uses a name variation
not covered in the entity’s knowledge base entry.

Intuitively, to disambiguate a polysemous entity
name, we should make use of the context in which
the name occurs, and to address synonymy, exter-
nal world knowledge is usually needed to expand
acronyms or find other name variations. Indeed
both strategies have been explored in existing litera-
ture (Zhang et al., 2010; Dredze et al., 2010; Zheng
et al., 2010). However, most existing work uses
supervised learning approaches that require careful
feature engineering and a large amount of training
data. In this paper, we take a simpler unsupervised
approach using statistical language model-based in-
formation retrieval. We use the KL-divergence re-
trieval model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001) and ex-
pand the query language models by considering both
the local contexts within the query documents and
global world knowledge obtained from the Web.

We evaluate our retrieval method with query ex-
pansion on the 2010 TAC-KBP data set. We find that
our expanded query language models can indeed
improve the performance significantly, demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of our principled and yet sim-
ple techniques. Comparison with the official results
from KBP participants also shows that our system is
competitive. In particular, when no disambiguation
text from the knowledge base is used, our system can
achieve an overall 85.2% accuracy and 9.3% relative
improvement over the best performance reported in
KBP 2010.

2 Task Definition and System Overview

Following TAC-KBP (Ji et al., 2010), we define the
entity linking task as follows. First, we assume
the existence of a Knowledge Base (KB) of enti-
ties. Each KB entry E represents a unique entity
and has three fields: (1) a name string NE , which
can be regarded as the official name of the entity,
(2) an entity type TE , which is one of {PER, ORG,
GPE, UNKNOWN}, and (3) some disambiguation
text DE . Given a query Q which consists of a query
name string NQ and a query document DQ where
the name occurs, the task is to return a single KB
entry to which the query name string refers or Nil if
there is no such KB entry.

It is fairly natural to address entity linking by
ranking the KB entries given a query. In this section

we present an overview of our system, which con-
sists of two major stages: a candidate selection stage
to identify a set of candidate KB entries through
name matching, and a ranking stage to link the query
entity to the most likely KB entry. In both stages,
we consider the query’s local context in the query
document and world knowledge obtained from the
Web. It is important to note that the selection stage
is based on string matching where the order of the
word matters. It is different from the ranking stage
where a probabilistic retrieval model based on bag-
of-word representation is used. Our preliminary ex-
periments demonstrate that without the first candi-
date selection stage the linking process results in low
performance.

2.1 Selecting Candidate KB Entries

The first stage of our system aims to filter out irrel-
evant KB entries and select only a set of candidates
that are potentially the correct match to the query.
Intuitively, we determine whether two entities are
the same by comparing their name strings. We there-
fore need to compare the query name string NQ with
the name string NE of each KB entry. However,
because of the name ambiguity problem, we cannot
expect the correct KB entry to always have exactly
the same name string as the query. To address this
problem, we use a set of alternative name strings ex-
panded from NQ and select KB entries whose name

805



strings match at least one of them. These alterna-
tive name strings come from two sources: the query
document DQ and the Web.

First, we observe that some useful alternative
name strings come from the query document. For
example, a PER query name string may contain only
a person’s last name but the query document con-
tains the person’s full name, which is clearly a less
ambiguous name string to use. Similarly, a GPE
query name string may contain only the name of a
city or town but the query document contains the
state or province, which also helps disambiguate the
query entity. Based on this observation, we do the
following. Given query Q, let SQ denote the set of
alternative query name strings. Initially SQ contains
only NQ. We then use an off-the-shelf NER tagger
to identify named entities from the query document
DQ. For PER and ORG queries, we select named
entities in DQ that contain NQ as a substring. For
GPE queries, we select named entities that are of the
type GPE, and we then combine each of them with
NQ. We denote these alternative name strings as
{N l,iQ }

KQ
i=1, where l indicates that these name strings

come locally from DQ and KQ is the total number of
such name strings. {N l,iQ } are added to SQ. Figure
1 and Figure 2 show two example queries together
with their SQ.

Sometimes alternative name strings have to come
from external knowledge. For example, one of the
queries we have contains the name string “AMPAS,”
and the query document also uses only this acronym
to refer to this entity. But the full name of the entity,
“Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences,” is
needed in order to locate the correct KB entry. To
tackle this problem, we leverage Wikipedia to find
the most likely official name. Given query name
string NQ, we check whether the following link ex-
ists: http://en.wikipedia.org/NQ. If NQ
is an abbreviation, Wikipedia will redirect the link
to the Wikipedia page of the corresponding entity
with its official name. So if the link exists, we use
the title of the Wikipedia page as another alternative
name string for NQ. We refer to this name string as
NgQ to indicate that it is a global name variant. N

g
Q is

also added to SQ. Figure 2 shows such an example.
For each name string N in SQ, we find KB entries

whose name strings match N . We take the union of

Query name string (NQ): Mobile
Query document (DQ): The site is near Mount Ver-
non in the Calvert community on the Tombigbee River,
some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Mobile. It’s on
a river route to the Gulf of Mexico and near Mobile’s
rails and interstates. Along with tax breaks and $400
million (euro297 million) in financial incentives, Al-
abama offered a site with a route to a Brazil plant that
will provide slabs for processing in Mobile.
Alternative Query Strings (SQ):
from local context: Mobile, Mobile Mount Vernon,
Mobile Calvert, Mobile River, Mobile Mexico, Mobile
Alabama, Mobile Brazil

Query name string (NQ): Coppola
Query document (DQ): I had no idea of all these
semi-obscure connections, felicia! Alex Greenwald
and Claire Oswalt aren’t names I’m at all familiar
with, but Jason Schwartzman I’ve heard of. Isn’t he
Sophia Coppola’s cousin? I think I once saw a pic-
ture of him sometime ago

these sets of KB entries and refer to it as EQ. These
are the candidate KB entries for query Q.

2.2 Ranking KB Entries
Given the candidate KB entries EQ, we need to
decide which one of them is the correct match.
We adopt the widely-used KL-divergence retrieval
model, a statistical language model-based retrieval
method proposed by Lafferty and Zhai (2001).
Given a KB entry E and query Q, we score E based
on the KL-divergence defined below:

s(E,Q) = −Div(θQ∥θE) = −
∑

w∈V
p(w|θQ) log

p(w|θQ)
p(w|θE)

.

(1)
Here θQ and θE are the query language model and

the KB entry language model, respectively. A lan-
guage model here is a multinomial distribution over
words (i.e. a unigram language model). V is the
vocabulary and w is a single word.

To estimate θE , we follow the standard maxi-
mum likelihood estimation with Dirichlet smooth-

806



ing (Zhai and Lafferty, 2004):

p(w|θE) =
c(w, E) + µp(w|θC)

|E| + µ , (2)

where c(w, E) is the count of w in E, |E| is the
number of words in E, θC is a background lan-
guage model estimated from the whole KB, and µ
is the Dirichlet prior. Recall that E contains NE , TE
and DE . We consider using either NE only or both
NE and DE to obtain c(w,E) and |E|. We refer
to the former estimated θE as θNE and the latter as
θNE+DE .

To estimate θQ, typically we can use the empirical
query word distribution:

p(w|θQ) =
c(w, NQ)

|NQ|
, (3)

where c(w,NQ) is the count of w in NQ and |NQ|
is the length of NQ. We call this model the original
query language model.

After ranking the candidate KB entries in EQ us-
ing Equation (1), we perform entity linking as fol-
lows. First, using an NER tagger, we determine the
entity type of the query name string NQ. Let TQ de-
note this entity type. We then pick the top-ranked
KB entry whose score is higher than a threshold τ
and whose TE is the same as TQ. The system links
the query entity to this KB entry. If no such entry
exists, the system returns Nil.

3 Query Expansion

We have shown in Section 2.1 that using the origi-
nal query name string NQ itself may not be enough
to obtain the correct KB entry, and additional words
from both the query document and external knowl-
edge can be useful. However, in the KB entry se-
lection stage, these additional words are only used
to enlarge the set of candidate KB entries; they have
not been used to rank KB entries. In this section, we
discuss how to expand the query language model θQ
with these additional words in a principled way in
order to rank KB entries based on how likely they
match the query entity.

3.1 Using Local Contexts
Let us look at the example from Figure 2 again.
During the KB entry ranking stage, if we use θQ
estimated from NQ, which contains only the word

“Coppola,” the retrieval function is unlikely to rank
the correct KB entry on the top. But if we include
the contextual word “Sophia” from the query doc-
ument when estimating the query language model,
KL-divergence retrieval model is likely to rank the
correct KB entry on the top. This idea of using
contextual words to expand the query is very sim-
ilar to (pseudo) relevance feedback in information
retrieval. We can treat the query document DQ as
our only feedback document.

Many different (pseudo) relevance feedback
methods have been proposed. Here we apply the
relevance model (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001), which
has been shown to be effective and robust in a re-
cent comparative study (Lv and Zhai, 2009). We
first briefly review the relevance model. Given a set
of (pseudo) relevant documents Dr, where for each
D ∈ Dr there is a document language model θD,
we can estimate a feedback language model θfbQ as
follows:

p(w|θfbQ) ∝
∑

D∈Dr
p(w|θD)p(θD)p(Q|θD). (4)

For our problem, since we have only a single feed-
back document DQ, the equation above can be sim-
plified. In fact, in this case the feedback language
model is the same as the document language model
of the only feedback document, i.e. θDQ .

We then linearly interpolate the feedback lan-
guage model with the original query language model
to form an expanded query language model:

p(w|θLQ) = αp(w|θQ) + (1 − α)p(w|θDQ), (5)

where α is a parameter between 0 and 1, to control
the amount of feedback. The larger α is, the less we
rely on the local context. L indicates that the query
expansion comes from local context. This θLQ can
then replace θQ in Equation (1) to rank KB entries.

Special Treatment of Named Entities
Usually the document language model θDQ is es-

timated using the entire text from DQ. For entity
linking, we suspect that named entities surrounding
the query name string in DQ are particularly useful
for disambiguation and thus should be emphasized
over other words. This can be done by weighting

807



NE and non-NE words differently. In the extreme
case, we can use only NEs to estimate the document
language model θDQ as follows:

p(w|θDQ) =
1

KQ

KQ∑

i=1

c(w, N l,iQ )

|N l,iQ |
, (6)

where {N l,iQ } are defined in Section 2.
Positional Model

Another observation is that words closer to the
query name string in the query document are likely
to be more important than words farther away. Intu-
itively, we can use the distance between a word and
the query name string to help weigh the word. Here
we apply a recently proposed positional pseudo rel-
evance feedback method (Lv and Zhai, 2010). The
document language model θDQ now has the follow-
ing form:

p(w|θDQ) =
1

KQ

KQ∑

i=1

f(pi, q) ·
c(w, N l,iQ )

|N l,iQ |
, (7)

where pi and q are the absolute positions of N
l,i
Q

and NQ in DQ. The function f is Gaussian function
defined as follows:

f(p, q) =
1√

2πσ2
exp

(−(p − q)2
2σ2

)
. (8)

where variance σ controls the spread of the curve.

3.2 Using Global World Knowledge
Similar to the way we incorporate words from DQ
into the query language model, we can also con-
struct a feedback language model using the most
likely official name of the query entity obtained from
Wikipedia. Specifically, we define

p(w|θNgQ) =
c(w, NgQ)

|NgQ|
. (9)

We can then linearly interpolate θNgQ with the orig-
inal query language model θQ to form an expanded
query language model θGQ:

p(w|θGQ) = αp(w|θQ) + (1 − α)p(w|θNgQ). (10)
Here G indicates that the query expansion comes

from global world knowledge.

Entity Type %Nil %non-Nil
GPE 32.8% 67.2 %
ORG 59.5% 40.5 %
PER 71.7% 28.3 %

Table 2: Percentages of Nil and non-Nil queries.

3.3 Combining Local Context and World
Knowledge

We can further combine the two kinds of additional
words into the query language model as follows:

p(w|θL+GQ ) = αp(w|θQ) + (1 − α)
(
βp(w|θDQ)

+(1 − β)p(w|θNgQ)
)
. (11)

Note that here we have two parameters α and β to
control the amount of contributions from the local
context and from global world knowledge.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Setup

Data Set: We evaluate our system on the TAC-KBP
2010 data set (Ji et al., 2010). The knowledge base
was constructed from Wikipedia with 818,741 en-
tries. The data set contains 2250 queries and query
documents come from news wire and Web pages.
Around 45% of the queries have non-Nil entries in
the KB. Some statistics of the queries are shown in
Table 2.
Tools: In our experiments, to extract named entities
within DQ and to determine TQ, we use the Stanford
NER tagger1. An example output of the NER tagger
is shown below:

<PERSON>Hugh Jackman<PERSON> is

Jacked!!

This piece of text comes from a query document
where the query name string is “Jackman.” We can
see that the NER tagger can help locate the full name
of the person.

We use the Lemur/Indri2 search engine for re-
trieval. It implements the KL-divergence retrieval
model as well as many other useful functionalities.
Evaluation Metric: We adopt the Micro-averaged
accuracy metric, which is the mean accuracy over
all queries. It was used in TAC-KBP 2010 (Ji et

1http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml
2http://www.lemurproject.org/indri.php

808



al., 2010) as the official metric to evaluate the per-
formance of entity linking. This metric is simply
defined as the percentage of queries that have been
correctly linked.
Methods to Compare: Recall that our system con-
sists of a KB entry selection stage and a KB entry
ranking stage. At the selection stage, a set SQ of
alternative name strings are used to select candidate
KB entries. We first define a few settings where dif-
ferent alternative name string sets are used to select
candidate KB entries:

• Q represents the baseline setting which uses
only the original query name string NQ to se-
lect candidate KB entries.

• Q+L represents the setting where alternative
name strings obtained from the query docu-
ment DQ are combined with NQ to select can-
didate KB entries.

• Q+G represents the setting where the alterna-
tive name string obtained from Wikipedia is
combined with NQ to select candidate KB en-
tries.

• Q+L+G represents the setting as we described
in Section 2.1, that is, alternative name strings
from both DQ and Wikipedia are used together
with NQ to select candidate KB entries.

After selecting candidate KB entries, in the KB
entry ranking stage, we have four options for the
query language model and two options for the KB
entry language model. For the query language
model, we have (1) θQ, the original query language
model, (2) θLQ, an expanded query language model
using local context from DQ, (3) θGQ, an expanded
query language model using global world knowl-
edge, and (4) θL+GQ , an expanded query language
model using both local context and global world
knowledge. For the KB entry language model, we
can choose whether or not to use the KB disam-
biguation text DE and obtain θNE and θNE+DE , re-
spectively.

4.2 Results and Discussion

First, we compare the performance of KB entry se-
lection stage for all four settings on non-Nil queries.
The performance measure recall is defined as

recall =

{
1, if E that refers to Q, exists in EQ
0, otherwise

The recall statistics in Table 3 shows that, Q+L+G
has the highest recall of the KB candidate entries.

Method Recall(%)
Q 67.1
Q+L 89.7
Q+G 94.9
Q+L+G 98.2

Table 3: Comparing the effect of candidate entry selec-
tion using different methods - KB entry selection stage
recall.

Before examining the effect of query expansion
in ranking, we now compare the effect of using dif-
ferent sets of alternative query name strings in the
candidate KB entry selection stage. For this set of
experiments, we fix the query language model to θQ
and the KB entry language model to θNE in the rank-
ing stage.

Table 4 shows the performance of all the settings
in terms of micro-averaged accuracy. The results
shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6 are based on the opti-
mum parameter settings. We can see that in terms
of the overall performance, both Q+L and Q+G give
better performance than Q with a 7.7% and a 9.9%
relative improvement, respectively. Q+L+G gives
the best performance with a 12.8% relative improve-
ment over Q. If we further zoom into the results, we
see that for ORG and PER queries, when no correct
KB entry exists (i.e. the Nil case), the performance
of Q, Q+L, Q+G and Q+L+G is very close, indicat-
ing that the additional alternative query name strings
do not help. It shows that the alternative query name
strings are most useful for queries that do have their
correct entries in the KB.

We now further analyze the impact of the ex-
panded query language models θLQ, θ

G
Q and θ

L+G
Q .

We first analyze the results without using the KB
disambiguation text, i.e. using θNE . Table 5 shows
the comparison between θQ and other expanded
query language models in terms of micro-averaged
accuracy. The results reveal that the expanded query
language models can indeed improve the overall per-
formance (the both Nil and non-Nil case) under all
settings. This shows the effectiveness of using the
principled query expansion technique coupled with
KL-divergence retrieval model to rank KB entries.

Table 5: Comparison between the performance of θQ and expanded query language models in terms of micro average
accuracy. θNE was used in ranking.

On the other hand, again we observe that the ef-
fects on the Nil and the non-Nil queries are differ-
ent. While in Table 4 the alternative name strings
do not affect the performance much for Nil queries,
now the expanded query language models actually
hurt the performance for Nil queries. It is not sur-
prising to see this result. When we expand the query
language model, we can possibly introduce noise,
especially when we use the external knowledge ob-
tained from Wikipedia, which largely depends on
what Wikipedia considers to be the most popular
official name of a query name string. With noisy
terms in the expanded query language model we in-
crease the chance to link the query to a KB entry
which is not the correct match. The challenge is that
we do not know when additional terms in the ex-
panded query language model are noise and when
they are not, because for non-Nil queries we do ob-
serve a substantial amount of improvement brought
by query expansion, especially with external world
knowledge. We will further investigate this research
question in the future.

We now further study the impact of using the KB
disambiguation text associated with each entry to es-
timate the KB entry language model used in the KL-
divergence ranking function. The results are shown
in Table 6 for all the methods on θNE vs. θNE+DE
using the expanded query language models. We can
see that for all methods the impact of using the KB
disambiguation text is very minimal and is observed

only for GPE and ORG queries. Table 7 shows an
example of the KL-divergence scores for a query,
Mobile whose context is previously shown in the
Figure 1. Without the KB disambiguation text both
the KB entry Mobile Alabama and the entry Mobile
River are given the same score, resulting in inaccu-
rate linking in the θNE case. But with θNE+DE , Mo-
bile Alabama was scored higher, resulting in an ac-
curate linking. However, we observe that such cases
are very rare in the TAC 2010 query list and thus the
overall improvement observed is minimal.

E0183287 Mobile River -6.28514 -6.69372

Table 7: The KL-divergence scores of KB entities for the
query Mobile.

Finally, we compare our performance with the
highest scores from TAC-KBP 2010 as shown in the
Table 8. It is important to note that the highest TAC
results shown in the table under each setting are not
necessarily obtained by the same team. We can see
that our overall performance when KB text is used is
competitive compared with the highest TAC score,
and is substantially higher than the TAC score when
KB text is not used. Lehmann et al. (2010) achieved
highest TAC scores. They used a variety of evidence
from Wikipedia like disambiguation pages, anchors,
expanded acronyms and redirects to build a rich fea-
ture set. But as we discussed, building a rich fea-

ture set is an expensive task. Their overall accu-
racy is 1.5% higher than our model. Table 8 shows
that the performance of ORG entities is lower when
compared with the TAC results when we used KB
text. In our analysis, we observed that, even though
some entities like AMPAS are linked correctly, the
entities like CCC (Consolidated Contractors Com-
pany) failed due to ambiguity in the title. Here, we
may benefit by leveraging more global knowledge,
i.e, we should expand the NgQ with Wikipedia global
context entities together with the title to fully benefit
from global knowledge. In particular, when KB text
is not used, our system outperforms the highest TAC
results for all three types of queries.

From the analysis by Ji et al. (2010), overall the
participating teams generally performed the best on
PER queries and the worst on GPE queries. With our
system, we can achieve good performance on GPE
queries.

4.3 Parameter Sensitivity
In all our experiments, we set the Dirichlet prior µ to
2500 following previous studies. For the threshold τ
we empirically set it to -12.0 in all the experiments
based on preliminary results. Recall that all the ex-
panded query language models also have a control
parameters α. The local context-based models θLQ
and θL+GQ have an additional parameter σ which
controls the proximity weighing. The θL+GQ model
has another additional parameter β that controls the
balance between local context and world knowledge.
In this subsection, we study the sensitivity of these
parameters. We plot the sensitivity graphs for all the
methods that involve α (β set to 0.5) in Figure 3. As
we can see, all the curves appear to be stable and
α=0.4 appears to work well.

is achieved when β=0.5. This implies that the local

accuracy.

Furthermore, we systematically test a fixed set of
σ values from 25 to 125 with an intervals of 25 and
examine how σ affects micro averaged accuracy. We
set α=0.4 and β=0.5, which is the best parameter
setting as discussed above. We plot the sensitivity
curves for the parameter σ for methods that utilize
the local context, i.e. θLQ and θ

L+G
Q , in Figure 5. We

observe that all the curves are stable and 75 <= σ
<= 100 appears to work well. We set σ=100 for all
our experiments. Moreover, after 100, the graph be-
comes stable, which indicates that proximity has less
impact on the method from this point on. This im-
plies that an equal weighing scheme actually would
work the same for these experiments. Part of the
reason may be that by using only named entities in
the context rather than all words, we have effectively
picked the most useful contextual terms. Therefore,
positional feedback models do have exhibit much
benefit for our problem.

5 Related Work

Bunescu and Pasca (2006) and Cucerzan (2007) ex-
plored the entity linking task using Vector Space
Models for ranking. They took a classification ap-
proach together with the novel idea of exploiting
Wikipedia knowledge. In their pioneering work,
they used Wikipedia’s category information for en-
tity disambiguation. They show that using differ-
ent background knowledge, we can find efficient ap-
proaches for disambiguation. In their work, they
took an assumption that every entity has a KB en-
try and thus the NIL entries are not handled.

Similar to other researchers, Zhang et al. (2010)
took an approach of classification and used a two-
stage approach for entity liking. They proposed a
supervised model with SVM ranking to filter out the
candidates and deal with disambiguation effectively.
For entity diambiguation they used the contextual
comparisons between the Wikipedia article and the
KB article. However, their work ignores the possi-
bilities of acronyms in the entities. Also, the am-
biguous geo-political names are not handled in their
work.

Dredze et al. (2010) took the approach that large
number of entities will be unlinkable, as there is
a probability that the relevant KB entry is unavail-
able. Their algorithm for learning NIL has shown
very good results. But their proposal for handling
the alias name or stage name via multiple lists is not
scalable. Unlike their approach, we use the global
knowledge to handle the stage names and thus this
gives an optimized solution to handle alias names.
Similarly, for acronyms we use the global knowl-
edge that aids unabbreviating and thus entity dis-
ambiguation. Similar to other approaches, Zheng
et al. (2010) took a learning to rank approach and
compared list-wise rank model to the pair-wise rank
model. They achieved good results on the list-wise
ranking approach. They handled acronyms and dis-
ambiguity through wiki redirect pages and the an-
chor texts which is similar to others ideas.

Challenges in supervised learning includes care-
ful feature selection. The features can be selected in
ad hoc manner - similarity based or semantic based.
Also machine learning approach induces challenges
of handling heterogenous cases. Unlike their ma-
chine learning approach which requires careful fea-

812



ture engineering and heterogenous training data, our
method is simple as we use simple similarity mea-
sures. At the same time, we propose a statistical
language modeling approach to the linking prob-
lem. Many researchers have proposed efficient ideas
in their works. We integrated some of their ideas
like world knowledge with our new techniques to
achieve efficient entity linking accuracy.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we proposed a novel approach to entity
linking based on statistical language model-based
information retrieval with query expansion using the
local context from the query document as well as
world knowledge from the Web. Our model is a sim-
ple unsupervised one that follows principled exist-
ing information retrieval techniques. And yet it per-
forms the entity linking task effectively compared
with the best performance achieved in the TAC-KBP
2010 evaluation.

Currently our model does not exploit world
knowledge from the Web completely. World knowl-
edge, especially obtained from Wikipedia, has
shown to be useful in previous studies. As our future
work, we plan to explore how to further incorporate
such world knowledge into our model in a principled
way.
