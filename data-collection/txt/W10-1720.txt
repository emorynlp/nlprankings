Abstract

This paper describes the DCU machine
translation system in the evaluation cam-
paign of the Joint Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation and Metrics
in ACL-2010. We describe the modular
design of our multi-engine machine trans-
lation (MT) system with particular focus
on the components used in this partici-
pation. We participated in the English–
Spanish and English–Czech translation
tasks, in which we employed our multi-
engine architecture to translate. We also
participated in the system combination
task which was carried out by the MBR
decoder and confusion network decoder.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we present the DCU multi-engine
MT system MATREX (Machine Translation using
Examples). This system exploits example-based
MT, statistical MT (SMT), and system combina-
tion techniques.

We participated in the English–Spanish (en–
es) and English–Czech (en–cs) translation
tasks. For these two tasks, we employ several
individual MT systems: 1) Baseline: phrase-
based SMT (Koehn et al., 2007); 2) EBMT:
Monolingually chunking both source and target
sides of the dataset using a marker-based chunker
(Gough and Way, 2004); 3) Factored translation
model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007); 4) Source-side
context-informed (SSCI) systems (Stroppa et al.,
2007); 5) the moses-chart (a Moses imple-
mentation of the hierarchical phrase-based (HPB)
approach of Chiang (2007)) and 6) Apertium (For-
cada et al., 2009) rule-based machine translation
(RBMT). Finally, we use a word-level combina-
tion framework (Rosti et al., 2007) to combine the

multiple translation hypotheses and employ a new
rescoring model to generate the final translation.

For the system combination task, we first use
the minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) (Kumar and
Byrne, 2004) decoder to select the best hypoth-
esis as the alignment reference for the confusion
network (CN) (Mangu et al., 2000). We then build
the CN using the TER metric (Snover et al., 2006),
and finally search for the best translation.

The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 details the various components of
our system, in particular the multi-engine strate-
gies used for the shared task. In Section 3, we
outline the complete system setup for the shared
task and provide evaluation results on the test set.
Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 The MATREX System

2.1 System Architecture

The MATREX system is a combination-based
multi-engine architecture, which exploits as-
pects of both the EBMT and SMT paradigms.
The architecture includes various individual sys-
tems: phrase-based, example-based, hierarchical
phrase-based and tree-based MT.

The combination structure uses the MBR and
CN decoders, and is based on a word-level com-
bination strategy (Du et al., 2009). In the final
stage, we use a new rescoring module to process
theN -best list generated by the combination mod-
ule. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture.

2.2 Example-Based Machine Translation

The EBMT system uses a language-specific, re-
duced set of closed-class marker morphemes or
lexemes (Gough and Way, 2004) to define a way
to segment sentences into chunks, which are then
aligned using an edit-distance-style algorithm, in
which edit costs depend on word-to-word transla-143

tion probabilities and the amount of word-to-word
cognates (Stroppa and Way, 2006).

Once these phrase pairs were obtained they
were merged with the phrase pairs extracted by
the baseline system adding word alignment infor-
mation.

2.3 Apertium RBMT

Apertium1 is a free/open-source platform for
RBMT. The current version of the en–es system
in Apertium was used for the system combination
task (section 2.7), and its morphological analysers
and part-of-speech taggers were used to build a
factored Moses model.

2.4 Factored Translation Model

We also used a factored model for the en–es
translation task. Factored models (Koehn and
Hoang, 2007) facilitate the translation by break-
ing it down into several factors which are further
combined using a log-linear model (Och and Ney,
2002).

We used three factors in our factored translation
model, which are used in two different decoding
paths: a surface form (SF) to SF translation factor,
a lemma to lemma translation factor, and a part-of-
speech (PoS) to PoS translation factor.

Finally, we used two decoding paths based on

1http://www.apertium.org

the above three translation factors: an SF to SF
decoding path and a path which maps lemma to
lemma, PoS to PoS, and an SF generated using
the TL lemma and PoS. The lemmas and PoS for
en and es were obtained using Apertium (sec-
tion 2.3).

2.5 Source-Side Context-informed PB-SMT

One natural way to express a context-informed
feature (ĥMBL) is to view it as the conditional
probability of the target phrases (êk) given the
source phrase (f̂k) and its source-side context in-
formation (CI):

ĥMBL = logP (êk|f̂k,CI(f̂k)) (1)

We use a memory-based machine learning
(MBL) classifier (TRIBL:2 Daelemans and
van den Bosch (2005)) that is able to estimate
P (êk|f̂k,CI(f̂k)) by similarity-based reasoning
over memorized nearest-neighbour examples of
source–target phrase translations. In equation (1),
SSCI may include any feature (lexical, syntactic,
etc.), which can provide useful information to
disambiguate a given source phrase. In addition
to using local words and PoS-tags as features,
as in (Stroppa et al., 2007), we incorporate
grammatical dependency relations (Haque et al.,
2009a) and supertags (Haque et al., 2009b) as
syntactic source context features in the log-linear
PB-SMT model.

In addition to the above feature, we derived a
simple binary feature ĥbest, defined in (2):

ĥbest =

{
1 if êk maximizes P (êk|f̂k,CI(f̂k))
0 otherwise

(2)
We performed experiments by integrating these

two features, ĥMBL and ĥbest, directly into the
log-linear framework of Moses.

2.6 Hierarchical PB-SMT model

For the en–cs translation task, we built
a weighted synchronous context-free grammar
model (Chiang, 2007) of translation that uses
the bilingual phrase pairs of PB-SMT as a start-
ing point to learn hierarchical rules. We used
the open-source Tree-Based translation system
moses-chart3 to perform this experiment.

of the TiMBL software package, which can be downloaded

2.7 System Combination
For multiple system combination, we used an
MBR-CN framework (Du et al., 2009, 2010) as
shown in Figure 1. Due to the varying word or-
der in the MT hypotheses, it is essential to define
the backbone which determines the general word
order of the CN. Instead of using a single system
output as the skeleton, we employ an MBR de-
coder to select the best single system output Er
from the merged N -best list by minimizing the
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) loss, as in (3):

r = arg min
i

Ns∑

j=1

(1− BLEU(Ej , Ei)) (3)

where Ns indicates the number of translations in
the merged N -best list, and {Ei}Nsi=1 are the trans-
lations themselves. In our task, we only merge the
1-best output of each individual system.

The CN is built by aligning other hypotheses
against the backbone, based on the TER metric.
Null words are allowed in the alignment. Ei-
ther votes or different confidence measures are as-
signed to each word in the network. Each arc in
the CN represents an alternative word at that po-
sition in the sentence and the number of votes for
each word is counted when constructing the net-
work. The features we used are as follows:

• word posterior probability (Fiscus, 1997);
• 3, 4-gram target language model;
• word length penalty;
• Null word length penalty;
We use MERT (Och, 2003) to tune the weights

of the CN.

2.8 Rescoring
Rescoring is a very important part in post-
processing which can select a better hypothesis
from the N -best list. We augmented our previ-
ous rescoring model (Du et al., 2009) with more
large-scale data. The features we used include:

• Direct and inverse IBM model;
• 3, 4-gram target language model;
• 3, 4, 5-gram PoS language model (Schmid,

1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1996);
• Sentence length posterior probability (Zens

and Ney, 2006);
• N -gram posterior probabilities within theN -

Best list (Zens and Ney, 2006);
• Minimum Bayes Risk probability;
• Length ratio between source and target sen-

tence;

The weights are optimized via MERT.

3 Experimental Setup

This section describes our experimental setup for
the en–cs and en–es translation tasks.

3.1 Data

Bilingual data: In the experiments we used data
sets provided by the workshop organizers. For the
en–cs translation table extraction we employed
both parallel corpora (News-Commentary10 and
CzEng 0.9), and for the en–es experiments, we
used the Europarl(Koehn, 2005), News Commen-
tary and United Nations parallel data. We used a
maximum sentence length of 80 for en–es and
40 for en–cs. Detailed statistics are shown in Ta-
ble 1.

News-Comm en–cs 85k 1.8M 1.6M
CzEng en–cs 7.8M 80M 69M

Table 1: Statistics of en–cs and en–es parallel data.

Monolingual data: For language modeling pur-
poses, in addition to the target parts of the bilin-
gual data, we used the monolingual News corpus
for cs; and the Gigaword corpus for es. For both
languages, we used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke,
2002) to train a 5-gram language model using all
monolingual data provided. However, for en–es
we used the IRSTLM toolkit (Federico and Cet-
tolo, 2007) to train a 5-gram language model using
the es Gigaword corpus. Both language models
use modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and
Goodman, 1996). Statistics for the monolingual
corpora are given in Table 2.

Corpus Language Sentences Tokens
E/N/NC/UN es 9,6M 290M
Gigaword es 40M 1,2G
News cs 13M 210M

Table 2: Statistics of Monolingual Data. E/N/NC/UN
refers to Europarl/News/News Commentary/United Nations
corpora.

For all the systems except Apertium, we first
lowercase and tokenize all the monolingual and
bilingual data using the tools provided by the
WMT10 organizers. After translation, system
combination output is detokenised and true-cased.145



3.2 English–Czech (en–cs) Experiments
The CzEng corpus (Bojar and Žabokrtský, 2009)
is a collection of parallel texts from sources of dif-
ferent quality and as such it contains some noise.
As the first step, we discarded those sentence pairs
having more than 10% of non-Latin characters.

The CzEng corpus is quite large (8M sen-
tence pairs). Although we were able to build
a vanilla SMT system on all parallel data avail-
able (News-Commentary + CzEng), we also at-
tempted to build additional systems using News-
Commentary data (which we considered in-
domain) and various in-domain subsets of CzEng
hoping to achieve better results on domain-
specific data.

For our first system, we selected 128,218 sen-
tence pairs from CzEng labeled as news. For the
other two systems, we selected subsets of 2M and
4M sentence pairs identified as most similar to
the development sets (as a sample of in-domain
data) based on cosine similarity of their represen-
tation in a TF-IDF weighted vector space model
(cf. Byrne et al. (2003)). We also applied the
pseudo-relevavance-feedback technique for query
expansion (Manning et al., 2008) to select another
subset with 2M sentence pairs.

We used the output of 15 systems for sys-
tem combination for the en–cs translation task.
Among these, 5 systems were built using Moses
and varying the size of the training data (DCU-
All, DCU-Ex2M, DCU-4M, DCU-2M and DCU-
News); 9 context-informed PB-SMT systems
(DCU-SSCI-*) using (combinations of) various
context features (word, PoS, supertags and depen-
dency relations) trained only on the News Com-
mentary data (marked with ‡ in Table 4); and one
system using the moses-chart decoder, also
trained on the news commentary data.

3.3 English–Spanish (en–es) Experiments
Three baseline systems using Moses were built,
where we varied the amount of training data used:

• epn: This system uses all of the Europarl and
News-Commentary parallel data.
• UN-half: This system uses the data suplied

to “epn”, plus an additional 2.1M sentences
pairs randomly selected from the United Na-
tions corpus.
• all: This system uses all of the available par-

allel data.

For en–es we also obtained output from the
factored model (trained only on the news com-

mentary corpus) and the Apertium RBMT sys-
tem. We also derived phrase alignments using the
MaTrEx EBMT system (Stroppa and Way, 2006),
and added those phrase translations in the Moses
phrase table. The systems marked with ? use a
language model built using the Spanish Gigaword
corpus, in addition to the one built using the pro-
vided monolingual data. These 6 sets of system
outputs are then used for system combination.

4 Conclusion

This paper presents the Dublin City University
MT system in WMT2010 shared task campaign.
This was DCU’s first attempt to translate from en
to es and cs in any shared task. We developed a
multi-engine framework which combined the out-
puts of several individual MT systems and gener-
ated a newN -best list after CN decoding. Then by146



using some global features, the rescoring model
generated the final translation output. The experi-
mental results demonstrated that the combination
module and rescoring module are effective in our
framework for both language pairs, and produce
statistically significant improvements as measured
by bootstrap resampling methods (Koehn, 2004)
on BLEU over the single best system.
