Abstract 

It  has  been  recognized  for  quite  some 
time that sustainable data formats play 
an  important  role  in  the  development 
and  curation  of  linguistic  resources. 
The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  show 
how GermaNet, the German version of 
the  Princeton  WordNet,  can  be  con-
verted  to  the  Lexical  Markup  Frame-
work (LMF), a published ISO standard 
(ISO-24613)  for  encoding  lexical  re-
sources.  The  conversion  builds  on 
Wordnet-LMF,  which  has  been  pro-
posed 
the  EU 
KYOTO project as an LMF format for 
wordnets. The present paper proposes a 
number  of  crucial  modifications  and  a 
set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that 
are needed for conversion of wordnets 
in  general  and  for  conversion  of  Ger-
maNet in particular.

Introduction 

1 
It has been recognized for quite some time that 
sustainable data formats play an important role 
in  the  development  and  curation  of  linguistic 
resources.  As  witnessed  by  the  success  of  the 
guidelines  of  the  Text  Encoding  Initiative 1 
(TEI) and of published standards issued by the 
International  Standards  Organization 2  (ISO), 
markup  languages  such  as  XML3 (short  for: 
Extensible  Markup  Language)  have  become 
lingua francas for encoding linguistic resources 
of different types, including phonetic transcrip-

tions,  (annotated)  text  corpora,  and  dictionar-
ies. It is fair to say that it has become common 
practice  among  developers  of  new  linguistic 
resources  to  consult  TEI  guidelines  and  ISO 
standards 
to  develop  standard-
conformant encoding schemes that serve as an 
interchange  format  and  that  can  be  docu-
mented  and  validated  by  Document  Type 
Definitions (DTD) and XML schemata. 

in  order 

However, for resources that were developed 
prior to or largely in parallel with the emerging 
acceptance of markup languages and of emerg-
ing  encoding  standards,  the  situation  is  far 
more heterogeneous. A wide variety of legacy 
formats  exists,  many  of  which  have  persisted 
due  to  existing  user  communities  and  the 
availability of tools that can process only such 
idiosyncratic  formats.  The  development  of 
wordnets for a large number of languages is a 
typical  example  of  a  type  of  linguistic  re-
source,  where  legacy  formats  still  persist  as  a 
de  facto  standard.  WordNet  1.6  is  encoded  in 
the data format of lexicographer files4 that was 
designed  for  the  English  Princeton  WordNet 
(Fellbaum,  1998).  It  is  a  plain-text  format  for 
storing wordnet data and allows lexicographers 
to  encode  lexical  and  conceptual  relations 
among lexical units and synsets by use of spe-
cial-purpose  diacritics.  There  exist  numerous 
tools that can process WordNet 1.6 lexicogra-
pher files to extract relevant information or to 
transform  the  data  into  other  special-purpose 
formats  such  as  Prolog-fact  databases.  Even 
tough  still  widely  used  for  the  reasons  just 
mentioned, the complexity of the format itself 
has a number of undesirable consequences. As 
Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have pointed out,

the editing of lexicographer files is highly er-
ror-prone  and  time-consuming  in  actual  lexi-
cographic  development.  Moreover, 
format 
validation  of  the  data  as  well  as  development 
of  new  tools  for  data  visualization  and  data 
extraction  become  increasingly  difficult  since 
they  cannot  be  based  on  generic  state-of-the-
art  tools,  that  are,  for  example,  available  for 
XML-based encodings. 

For exactly these reasons, XML-based inter-
change  formats  have  been  proposed  in  recent 
years also for wordnets. One of the first, if not 
the first, example is the XML format for Ger-
maNet5, a wordnet for German (Lemnitzer and 
Kunze, 2002; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010). An 
even  more  recent  development  along  these 
lines is the specification of Wordnet-LMF (see 
Soria et al., 2009), an instantiation of the Lexi-
cal  Markup  Framework6 (LMF,  (Francopoulo 
et al., 2006)) customized for wordnets. 

Since LMF is an ISO standard (ISO-24613), 
it  is  a  particularly  attractive  candidate  for  en-
coding wordnets. Everything else being equal, 
ISO  standards  have  a  high  chance  of  being 
adopted by a wide user community and of be-
ing recognized as an interchange format.7 Such 
agreed-upon  interchange  formats  are  a  crucial 
prerequisite  for  interoperable  linguistic  re-
sources  in  the  context  of  web  services  and  of 
processing pipelines for linguistic resources. 

The purpose of this paper is threefold: 
1.  To compare and contrast the GermaNet 

XML initially proposed by Lemnitzer 
and Kunze (2002) with the Wordnet-
LMF. This comparison is instructive 
since it reveals two completely differ-
ent conceptions of representing seman-
tic knowledge at the lexical level. 

2.  To point out a number of open issues 

that need to be resolved if Wordnet-
LMF is to be adopted widely among

6 See http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org 
7 An anonymous reviewer raised the question why OWL 
is not a good candidate for encoding wordnets. On this 
issue, we agree with the assessment of Soria et al. (2009) 
who point out that “[…] RDF and OWL are conceptual 
repositories representation formats that are not designed 
to represent polysemy and store linguistic properties of 
words and word meanings.” 

wordnets for a steadily increasing 
number of languages. 

3.  To show how these open issues can be 

resolved in a customized version of 
Wordnet-LMF suitable for GermaNet. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  as 
follows: section 2 provides a general introduc-
tion  to  GermaNet.  Details  about  the  adapted 
XML format used for GermaNet up until now 
are provided in section 3. Section 4 introduces 
the challenge of how to represent a wordnet in 
the Lexical Markup Framework. As one possi-
bility,  Wordnet-LMF  is  regarded.  Issues  that 
arise  during  the  conversion  of  GermaNet  into 
Wordnet-LMF  lead  to  a  modified  version  of 
Wordnet-LMF.  Finally,  section  5  concludes 
with  a  comparison  of  the  two  representation 
formats. 
2  GermaNet 
GermaNet is a lexical semantic network that is 
modeled after the Princeton WordNet for Eng-
lish. It partitions the lexical space into a set of 
concepts that are interlinked by semantic rela-
tions. A semantic concept is modeled by a syn-
set.  A  synset  is  a  set  of  words  (called  lexical 
units)  where  all  the  words  are  taken  to  have 
(almost) the same meaning. Thus a synset is a 
set-representation  of  the  semantic  relation  of 
synonymy,  which  means  that  it  consists  of  a 
list  of  lexical  units  and  a  paraphrase  (repre-
sented  as  a  string).  The  lexical  units  in  turn 
have  frames  (which  specify  the  syntactic  va-
lence of the lexical unit) and examples. The list 
of lexical units for a synset is never empty, but 
any of the other properties may be. 

There are two types of semantic relations in 
GermaNet:  conceptual  and  lexical  relations. 
Conceptual relations hold between two seman-
tic  concepts,  i.e.  synsets.  They  include  rela-
tions  such  as  hyperonymy,  part-whole  rela-
tions,  entailment,  or  causation.  Lexical  rela-
tions hold between two individual lexical units. 
Antonymy, a pair of opposites, is an example 
of a lexical relation. 

GermaNet covers the three word categories 
of adjectives, nouns, and verbs, each of which 
is hierarchically structured in terms of the hy-
peronymy relation of synsets.

3  Current GermaNet XML Format 
The structure of the XML files closely follows 
the  internal  structure  of  GermaNet,  which 
means that the file structure mirrors the under-
lying relational organization of the data. There 
are two DTDs that jointly describe the XML-
encoded  GermaNet.  One  DTD  represents  all 
synsets with their lexical units and their attrib-
utes (see subsection 3.1). The other DTD rep-
resents all relations, both conceptual and lexi-
cal relations (see subsection 3.2). 

The  GermaNet  XML  format  was  initially 
developed by Kunze and Lemnitzer (2002), but 
modifications  of  the  GermaNet  data  itself  led 
to an adopted XML format, which is presented 
here.8 
3.1  XML Synset Files 
The  XML  files  that  represent  all  synsets  and 
lexical  units  of  GermaNet  are  organized 
around the three word categories currently in-
cluded  in  GermaNet:  nouns,  adjectives,  and 
verbs  (altogether  54  synset  files  since  the  se-
mantic space for each word category is divided 
into a number of semantic subfields). 

The structure of each of these files is illus-
trated in Figure 19. Each synset represents a set 
of lexical units (lexUnits) which all express the 
same  meaning.  This  grouping  represents  the 
                                                 
8 The interested reader might compare the version at hand 
with (Lemnitzer and Kunze, 2002) or (Kunze and Lem-
nitzer, 2002), which both describe the initial GermaNet 
XML version.

simplicity. 

semantic  relation  of  synonymy.  Further  prop-
erties of a synset (e.g., the word category or a 
describing paraphrase) and a lexical unit (e.g., 
a  sense  number  or  the  orthographical  form 
(orthForm)) are encoded appropriately. 

Figure  1  describes  the  underlying  XML 
structure. Each box in the figure stands for an 
element in the XML files, and the properties in 
each box (listed underneath the wavy line) rep-
resent the attributes of an XML element. This 
means, for example, that a synset element has 
the attributes of an id and a category.10 

Figure 2 shows an example of a synset with 
two  lexical  units  (lexUnit  elements)  and  a 
paraphrase. The lexUnit elements in turn con-
tain  several  attributes  and  an  orthographical 
form  (the  orthForm  element),  e.g.,  leuchten 
(German  verb  for:  to  shine).  The  first  of  the 
two lexical units even has a frame and an ex-
ample. 

<synset id="s58377" category="verben"> 
  <lexUnit id="l82207" 
           sense="1" 
           namedEntity="no" 
           artificial="no" 
           styleMarking="no"> 
    <orthForm>leuchten</orthForm> 
    <frame>NN</frame> 
    <example> 
      <text> 
        Der Mond leuchtete in der Nacht. 
      </text> 
      <exframe>NN</exframe> 
    </example> 
  </lexUnit> 
  <lexUnit id="l82208" 
                                                 
10 Note that XML element or attribute names appear italic 
if they are referenced in the text.

    Lichtstrahlen aussenden, 
    große Helligkeit verbreiten 
  </paraphrase> 
</synset>

3.2  XML Relation File 
This type of XML file represents both kinds of 
relations: conceptual and lexical relations. All 
relations  are  encoded  within  one  XML  file, 
whose structure is illustrated in Figure 3. 

 

 
Figure 3. Structure of the XML relation file. 

 
The  boxes  in  Figure  3  again  represent  XML 
elements,  which  means  that  there  is  one  rela-
tions element that contains all lexical relations 
(lex_rel  elements)  and  conceptual  relations 
(con_rel elements). Both relation types contain 
several attributes. 

Figure  4  illustrates  an  example  for  each  of 
the two relation types. The type of the concep-
tual  relation  is  hyperonymy  (indicated  by  the 
name attribute), and it holds between the syn-
set  with  ID  s58377  (from  attribute)  and  the 
synset with ID s58376 (to attribute). The lexi-
cal  relation  is  of  type  antonymy  (again  indi-
cated  by  the  name  attribute),  and  holds  be-
tween  the  lexical  units  with  the  IDs  l2471 
(from attribute) and l12470 (to attribute). 

<con_rel name="hyperonymy" 
         from="s58377" to="s58376" 
         dir="revert" inv="hyponymy" /> 
<lex_rel name="antonymy" 
         from="l2471" to="l2470" 
         dir="both" />

4  Wordnet-LMF 
The  Lexical  Markup  Framework  (ISO-24613) 
is  an  ISO  standard  for  encoding  natural  lan-
guage  processing  lexicons  and  machine  read-
able  dictionaries  (Francopoulo  et  al.,  2006). 
The intention of LMF is to provide a common 
model  for  the  creation  and  use  of  lexical  re-
sources,  to  manage  the  exchange  of  data  be-
tween  and  among  these  resources,  and  to  en-
able the merging of a large number of individ-
ual  electronic  resources  to  form  extensive 
global electronic resources. 
4.1  The Challenge 
The core structure of LMF is based on the pro-
totypical  structuring  of  a  lexicon  in  terms  of 
lexical  entries,  each  of  which  enumerates  the 
different senses of the lexical item in question. 
This  word-driven  perspective  contrasts  the 
synset-driven relational structure of wordnets – 
the grouping of word senses (i.e., lexical units) 
that  express  the  same  meaning  into  synsets. 
Exactly  these  two  radically  different  organiz-
ing  principles  (relation-based  in  the  case  of 
wordnets versus lexical-entry-based in the case 
of  LMF)  constitute  the  challenge  of  encoding 
wordnets  in  LMF.  We  take  up  this  challenge: 
How  can  a  synset-based  wordnet,  e.g.  Ger-
maNet, be represented in a word-driven format 
like LMF? 
4.2  Apply LMF to Wordnets 
The  conversion  of  GermaNet  to  LMF  will 
build on Wordnet-LMF (Soria et al., 2009; Lee 
et  al.,  2009),  an  existing  Lexical  Markup 
Framework  subset11.  Wordnet-LMF  has  been 
developed  in  the  context  of  the  EU  KYOTO

                                                 
11 Wordnet-LMF is a proper subset of LMF since there 
are specifications in LMF that are not in Wordnet-LMF 
and since there is nothing in Wordnet-LMF which is not 
in LMF. Soria et al. (2009) themselves refer to Wordnet-
LMF as an LMF dialect.

project12 and  is  especially  tailored  to  encode 
wordnets in the LMF standard. 

Wordnet-LMF  is  specified  by  a  Document 
Type Definition (see Appendix E in (Soria and 
Monachini,  2008))  and  fully  complies  with 
standard LMF. 

The Wordnet-LMF XML structure is shown 
in  Figure  513.  There  is  a  Lexical  Resource 
which  contains  at  least  one  Lexicon  (in  this 
case a wordnet lexicon).14 A Lexical Entry rep-
resents  a  word  entry  in  a  Lexicon,  where  the 
word  itself  is  represented  by  the  writtenForm 
attribute  of  the  Lemma  element.  Lexical  En-
tries  group  different  Senses  of  a  particular 
word.  The  Senses  have  a  synset  attribute  that 
relates them to a Synset element by the corre-
sponding ID. If two Senses have the same syn-
set  attribute,  they  belong  to  the  same  Synset 
and are thus synonyms. 

A Synset can have several relations to other 
Synsets.  These  relations  are  encoded  in  Syn-
setRelation elements.

13 Note that this figure does not show the whole Wordnet-
LMF model. Only the monolingual part that is relevant 
for this paper is represented. The representation of multi-
lingual resources (i.e., the optional SenseAxis element 
with its children) is not considered in this paper. For a 
complete picture, see Soria et Monachini (2008). 
14 Here, XML element or attribute names again appear 
italic if they are referenced in the text. 

4.3  Apply Wordnet-LMF to GermaNet 
The  differences  between  the  synset-driven 
structure  of  GermaNet  (see  Figures  1  and  3) 
and  the  word-driven  format  of  Wordnet-LMF 
(see Figure 5) are obvious. But there is also a 
strong commonality: Both formats have synset 
elements  that  cluster  synonymous  words.  In 
GermaNet, the words are represented by lexi-
cal units that are child elements of a synset. In 
Wordnet-LMF,  senses,  which  correspond  to 
the  lexical  units  in  GermaNet,  are  linked  to  a 
synset (by an attribute containing a synset ID). 
The  conversion  of  GermaNet  to  Wordnet-
LMF proceeds as follows: Each lexical unit of 
GermaNet  is  turned  into  a  Sense  element  in 
Wordnet-LMF  (see  Figure  5).  The  synset  at-
tribute  (containing  a  Synset  ID)  of  the  Sense 
element links this Sense with the Synset that it 
is  a  member  of.  The  different  Sense  elements 
are  grouped  by  their  orthographical  form  (the 
Lemma in Wordnet-LMF) into Lexical Entries. 
An example of a GermaNet LexicalEntry in 
Wordnet-LMF  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  This 
LexicalEntry  represents  the  word  leuchten 
(German  verb  for:  to  shine),  as  the  written-
Form  attribute  of  the  Lemma  element  indi-
cates. This LexicalEntry has two Senses, which 
belong  to  different  Synsets  (see  the  different 
synset attributes of the Sense elements). 

461

Each  Sense  has  a  MonolingualExternalRefs 
element  with  at  least  one  MonolingualExter-
nalRef  representing  a  reference  to  an  external 
system. In this case, each Sense is linked to the 
corresponding  entry  in  the  GermaNet  data-
base 15;  the  externalReference  attribute  of  a 
MonolingualExternalRef specifies the database 
table name with a database ID. 

<LexicalEntry id="deu-52-l4601-v"> 
  <Lemma writtenForm="leuchten" 
                       partOfSpeech="v" /> 
  <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_1" 
                 synset="deu-52-s58377-v"> 
    <MonolingualExternalRefs> 
      <MonolingualExternalRef 
        externalSystem="GermaNet-Database" 
        externalReference= 
               "lex_uni_table#id=82207" /> 
    </MonolingualExternalRefs> 
  </Sense> 
  <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_2" 
                 synset="deu-52-s58718-v"> 
    <MonolingualExternalRefs> 
      <MonolingualExternalRef 
        externalSystem="GermaNet-Database" 
        externalReference= 
               "lex_uni_table#id=82677" /> 
    </MonolingualExternalRefs> 
  </Sense> 
</LexicalEntry> 

Figure 6. Example of a LexicalEntry. 

 

 

In the next conversion step, all synsets of Ger-
maNet  are  listed  with  their  relations  to  other 
synsets. The corresponding Synset (with the ID 
deu-52-s58377-v) of the first Sense in Figure 6 
is  illustrated  in  Figure  7.  It  has,  inter  alia,  a 
describing gloss and two example sentences. 

The  element  SynsetRelations  encodes  rela-
tions  to  other  Synset  instances.  The  relations 
are simply encoded with a target attribute that 
contains the ID of the referencing Synset. The 
Synsets  in  Wordnet-LMF  are  logically  the 
“same” as the synsets in GermaNet XML, i.e. 
the  concept  that  a  synset  expresses  is  exactly 
the same in both formats. 

Each  Synset  has  a  reference  to  the  Ger-
the  Monolin-
maNet  database.  Therefore, 
gualExternalRef  element  links  to  the  corre-
sponding entry in the GermaNet database; the

base table name with the synsets database ID.

example  in  Wordnet-LMF  that  was  already 
shown in the GermaNet XML format in Figure 
1. 
4.4  Necessary  Modifications  to  Wordnet-

LMF 

As the previous discussion has shown, Word-
net-LMF provides a very useful basis for con-
verting  GermaNet  into  LMF.  However,  a 
number of modifications to Wordnet-LMF are 
needed if this conversion is to preserve all in-
formation present in the original resource. The 
present section will discuss a number of modi-
fications to Wordnet-LMF that are needed for 
conversion of wordnets in general. In addition, 
we  will  also  discuss  a  set  of  extensions  to 
Wordnet-LMF  that  are  needed  for  conversion 
of GermaNet in particular. 

The most glaring omission in Wordnet-LMF 
concerns  the  modeling  of  lexical  relations 
which  hold  between  lexical  units  (i.e.,  Senses 
in  the  terminology  of  Wordnet-LMF).  In  the 
current  Wordnet-LMF  DTD  only  conceptual 
relations (i.e., SynsetRelations in the terminol-
ogy  of  Wordnet-LMF),  which  hold  between 
synsets, are modeled. Thus antonymy, which is 
a  typical  example  of  a  lexical  relation  (see 
(Fellbaum, 1998) for further details), can cur-

462

rently  not  be  modeled  without  violating  the 
Wordnet-LMF DTD. 

Among  the  synset  relations  specified  in 
Wordnet-LMF, the entailment relation is miss-
ing, which plays a crucial role in the modeling 
of  verbs  in  the  Princeton  WordNet  and  in 
GermaNet alike. The list of values of attribute 
relType  for  SynsetRelation  elements  (see  Ap-
pendix  A  in  (Soria  and  Monachini,  2008)) 
therefore has to be amended accordingly.16 

A  third  omission  in  the  current  Wordnet-
LMF  DTD  concerns  syntactic  frames  used  in 
the Princeton WordNet to indicate the syntac-
tic  valence  of  a  given  word  sense.  Syntactic 
frames are also used in GermaNet, albeit using 
a  different  encoding 17.  Syntactic  frames  to-
gether with example sentences, which illustrate 
the  meaning  and  prototypical  usage  of  a  par-
ticular  word,  help  to  distinguish  among  word 
senses. 

In  WordNet  both  syntactic  frames  and  ex-
amples are linked to synsets. However, at least 
in  the  case  of  syntactic  frames  the  linkage  to 
synsets  seems  problematic  since  different 
members  of  the  same  synset  may  well  have 
different  valence  frames.  For  example,  the 
German verbs finden and begegnen both mean 
meet and thus belong to the same synset. Both 
are transitive verbs, but their object NPs have 
different cases: accusative case for treffen and 
dative  case  for  begegnen.  As  this  example 
shows, syntactic frames need to be associated 
with  lexical  units  rather  than  synsets.  This  is 
exactly  the  design  choice  made  in  GermaNet, 
as shown in Figure 1. 

A related question concerns the anchoring of 
example  sentences  which  illustrate  the  mean-
ings  and  prototypical  usage  of  a  particular 
word  sense.  In  both  the  Princeton  WordNet 
and  GermaNet  such  examples  are  associated

                                                 
16 Piek Vossen (personal communication) has pointed out 
to us that Wordnet-LMF does not impose a list of rela-
tions as a standard yet. 
17 In WordNet, frames are encoded in a controlled lan-
guage using paraphrases such as Somebody ----s some-
thing for a transitive verb with an animate subject and an 
inanimate object. The frames in GermaNet use comple-
mentation codes provided with the German version of the 
CELEX Lexical Database (Baayen et al., 2005) such as 
NN.AN for transitive verbs with accusative objects. 

with  lexical  units18.  GermaNet  correlates  ex-
amples  additionally  with  particular  syntactic 
frames and treats both examples and syntactic 
frames as properties of lexical units, i.e. Senses 
in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF. 

The above issues lead to a modified version 
of the Wordnet-LMF DTD as shown in Figure 
8. Compared to Figure 5, the Sense element is 
enriched  by  three  optional  subelements:  Sen-
seRelations, SenseExamples, and Subcategori-
zationFrames. 

It has to be noted, though, that LMF proper 
contains all necessary elements. The three no-
tions  SenseRelation,  SenseExample,  and  Sub-
categorizationFrame  come  from  LMF  proper 
and these elements can be used to remedy the 
omissions in Wordnet-LMF. 

The SenseRelation element in Figure 8 rep-
resents relations between different Senses (the 
lexical  units  in  GermaNet).  The  SenseExam-
ples  and  SubcategorizationFrames  elements 
both  group  several  SenseExample  or  Subcate-
gorizationFrame  instances.  A  Subcategoriza-
tionFrame  element  represents  the  syntactic 
valence  of  a  word  sense.  A  SenseExample 
shows  the  prototypical  usage  of  a  word  sense 
as an example sentence. The syntactic valence 
for a concrete example sentence can be speci-
fied with the optional frame attribute of a Sen-
seExample. 
5  Conclusion:  Comparing  GermaNet 

XML with Wordnet-LMF XML 

We would like to conclude with a comparison 
between  the  GermaNet  native  XML  format 
described in section 3 and the modified Word-
net-LMF format described in section 4.4. Since 
the GermaNet native XML format was particu-
larly  tailored  to  the  structure  of  GermaNet,  it 
enjoys  the  usual  advantages  of  such  custom-
ized solutions: it contains all and only the nec-
essary  XML  elements  and  attributes  to  de-
scribe the resource. Moreover, the data are dis-
tributed  over  55  different  XML  files,  which 
facilitates  easy  data  handling  and  efficient 
search  by  word  classes  and  lexical  fields. 
These  properties  are  in  fact  exploited  by  a 
number  of  GermaNet-specific  tools,  including

                                                 
18 In WordNet, the examples are placed at the synset 
level, but referencing to a word sense at the same time.

a GermaNet-Explorer, a tool for data explora-
tion and retrieval, and a GermaNet Pathfinder, 
a  tool  for  the  calculation  of  semantic  related-
ness,  similarity,  and  distance  (Cramer  and 
Finthammer,  2008).  All  of  these  tools  utilize 
the  Java  API  that  has  been  developed  for  the 
GermaNet native XML format. 

At the same time the GermaNet native XML 
format  is  a  proprietary  data  format  that  was 
developed  at  a  time  when  the  only  de  facto 
encoding  standard  for  wordnets  consisted  of 
the  lexicographer  files,  originally  developed 
for the Princeton WordNet. As such GermaNet 
XML  was  never  developed  with  the  goal  of 
providing  an  XML  standard  for  modeling 
wordnets  in  general.  With  Wordnet-LMF  a 
candidate standard has now been proposed that 
is  compliant  with  the  LMF  ISO  standard  for 
lexical  resources  and  that  strives  to  provide  a 
general encoding standard of wordnets for dif-
ferent  languages.  As  the  discussion  in  section 
4.4 has shown, the current Wordnet-LMF DTD 
still  needs  to  be  amended  to  account  for  the 
full  range  of  wordnet  relations,  frames,  and 
examples  (see  Figure  8).  These  elements  are 
not in Wordnet-LMF because Wordnet-LMF is 
a subset, but these elements are defined in the 
ISO  document  24613  where  LMF  proper  is 
defined.  However,  Wordnet-LMF  appears  to 
be  suitably  mature  to  serve  as  an  interchange 
format  for  wordnets  of  different  languages  as 

well  as  for  linking  wordnets  of  different  lan-
guages with one another19.
