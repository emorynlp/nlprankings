Abstract

Grammatical error correction, like other ma-
chine learning tasks, greatly benefits from
large quantities of high quality training data,
which is typically expensive to produce. While
writing a program to automatically generate
realistic grammatical errors would be difficult,
one could learn the distribution of naturally-
occurring errors and attempt to introduce them
into other datasets. Initial work on induc-
ing errors in this way using statistical machine
translation has shown promise; we investigate
cheaply constructing synthetic samples, given
a small corpus of human-annotated data, using
an off-the-rack attentive sequence-to-sequence
model and a straight-forward post-processing
procedure. Our approach yields error-filled ar-
tificial data that helps a vanilla bi-directional
LSTM to outperform the previous state of the
art at grammatical error detection, and a pre-
viously introduced model to gain further im-
provements of over 5% F0.5 score. When at-
tempting to determine if a given sentence is
synthetic, a human annotator at best achieves
39.39 F1 score, indicating that our model gen-
erates mostly human-like instances.

1 Introduction

There is an ever-growing number of people learn-
ing English as a second language; providing them
with quick feedback to facilitate their learning is
a crucial, labour-intensive endeavour. Part of this
process is identifying and correcting grammati-
cal errors, and several computational techniques
have been developed to automate it (Rozovskaya
and Roth, 2014; Junczys-Dowmunt and Grund-
kiewicz, 2016). For example, given an erroneous
sentence “I wanted to goes to the beach”, the
grammatical error correction task is to output the
valid sentence “I wanted to go to the beach”.
The task can be cast as a two-stage process, de-
tection and correction, which can either be per-

formed sequentially (Yannakoudakis et al., 2017),
or jointly (Napoles and Callison-Burch, 2017).

Automated error correction performance is ar-
guably still too low for practical considera-
tion, perhaps limited by the amount of training
data (Rei et al., 2017). High quality annotations
are expensive to procure, and foreign language
learners and commercial entities may feel uncom-
fortable granting access to their data. Instead, one
could attempt to supplement existing manual an-
notations with synthetic instances. Such artificial
samples are beneficial only when they share struc-
ture with the true distribution from which human
errors are generated. Generative Adversarial Net-
works (Goodfellow et al., 2014) could be used for
this purpose, but they are difficult to train, and re-
quire a large collection of sentences that are incor-
rect. One might attempt self-training (McClosky
et al., 2006), where new instances are generated
by applying a trained model to unannotated data,
using high-confidence predictions as ground truth
labels. However, in such a scheme, the expectation
is that the unlabelled text already contains errors,
which is not usually the case for most freely avail-
able text such as Wikipedia articles as they strive
towards correctness.

In place of using machine translation (MT)
to correct grammatical mistakes (Yuan and Fe-
lice, 2013; Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz,
2014; Yuan and Briscoe, 2016), one might con-
sider swapping the input and output streams, and
instead learn to induce errors into error-free text,
for the purpose of creating a synthetic training
dataset (Felice and Yuan, 2014). Recently, Rei
et al. (2017) used a statistical MT (SMT) sys-
tem to induce errors into error-free text. Build-
ing on this work, and leveraging recent advances
in neural MT (NMT), we used an off-the-shelf at-
tentive sequence-to-sequence model (Britz et al.,
2017), eliminating the need of specialised soft-



4978

ware such as a phrase-table generator, decoder,
and part-of-speech tagger. We created multi-
ple synthetic datasets from in-domain and out-
of-domain sources, and found that stochastic to-
ken sampling, and pruning redundant and low-
likelihood sentences, were helpful in generating
meaningful corruptions. Using the artificial sam-
ples thus generated, we improved upon detec-
tion results with simply a vanilla bi-directional
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Us-
ing a more powerful model, we established new
state-of-the-art results, that improve on previously
published F0.5 scores by over 5%. Addition-
ally, we confirm that our generated instances are
human-like, as an annotator identifying generated
sentences achieved a maximum F1 score of 39.39.

2 Related work

In computer vision, images are blurred, rotated, or
otherwise deformed inexpensively to create new
training instances (Wang and Perez, 2017), be-
cause such manipulation does not significantly
alter the image semantics. Similar coarse pro-
cesses do not work in NLP since mutating even
a single letter or a word can change a sentence’s
meaning, or render it nonsensical. Nonetheless,
Vinyals et al. (2015) employed a kind of self-
training where they use noisy predictions for un-
labelled instances output by existing state-of-the-
art parsers as ground-truth labels, and improved
syntactic parsing performance. Sennrich et al.
(2016) synthesised training instances by round-
trip-translating a monolingual corpus with weaker
versions of an NMT learner, and used them to im-
prove the translation. Bouchard et al. (2016) de-
veloped an efficient algorithm to blend generated
and true data for improving generalisation.

Grammar correction is a well-studied task in
NLP, and early systems were rule-based pattern
recognisers (Macdonald, 1983) and dictionary-
based linguistic analysis engines (Richardson and
Braden-Harder, 1988). Later systems used sta-
tistical approaches, addressing specific kinds of
errors such as article insertion (Knight et al.,
1994) and spelling correction (Golding and Roth,
1996). Most recently, architectural innovations in
neural sequence labelling (Rei et al., 2016; Rei,
2017) raised error detection performance through
improved ability to process unknown words and
jointly learning a language model.

Early efforts for artificial error generation in-

cluded generating specific types of errors, such as
mass noun errors (Brockett et al., 2006) and arti-
cle errors (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010), and lever-
aging linguistic information to identify error pat-
terns and transfer them onto grammatically correct
text (Foster and Andersen, 2009; Yuan and Felice,
2013). Imamura et al. (2012) investigated meth-
ods to generate pseudo-erroneous sentences for er-
ror correction in Japanese. Recently, Rei et al.
(2017) corrupted error-free text using SMT to cre-
ate training instances for error detection.

3 Neural error generation

To learn to introduce errors, we use an off-the-
shelf attentive sequence-to-sequence neural net-
work (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Given an input se-
quence, the encoder generates context vectors for
each token. Then, the attention mechanism and
the decoder work in tandem to emit a distribution
over the target vocabulary. At every decoder time-
step, the encoder context vectors are scored by the
attention mechanism, and a weighted sum is sup-
plied to the decoder, along with its propagated in-
ternal state and last output symbol.

Corruption: Tokens from this distribution are
sampled at every decoder time-step, either by
argmax (AM), which emits the most likely word,
or by a stochastic alternative such as temperature
sampling (TS) as argmax cannot be relied on
to generate rare words. A temperature parameter
τ > 0 sharpens or softens the distribution:

p̃i = fτ (p)i =
p

1
τ
i∑
j p

1
τ
j

where i are the components of the probability dis-
tribution corresponding to words in the vocabu-
lary. As one interpolates τ from 0 to 1, the be-
haviour of p̃ transitions from argmax to p, control-
ling the diversity of the generated tokens.

The sentence generated by TS might be a low
probability sequence from the joint conditional
distribution P (v|u), where u is the input sentence
and v is the output sentence. One way around this
is to use beam search (BS), which checks the like-
lihood of every possible continuation of a sentence
fragment, and maintains a list of the n best trans-
lations generated up to the current time-step. AM,
TS, and BS are indicative of the trade-off between
increasing levels of model flexibility at the cost of
computation; we compare them to assess whether

the additional computations were helpful in creat-
ing high-quality synthetic instances.

Post-processing: Original and corrupted sen-
tences are aligned at a word-level using Leven-
shtein distance. Using the minimal alignment,
words in the corrupted sentence are labelled cor-
rect, ‘c’, or incorrect, ‘i’, as follows:

If the word is not aligned with itself, then ‘i’.
Else, if following a gap, then ‘i’, as at this point
a human reader would notice that there is a word
missing in the sentence. Else, if it is the last word,
but it is not aligned to the last word of the source
sentence, then ‘i’, as a human would realise that
this sentence ends abruptly, Else, ‘c’.

These token-labelled corrupted sentences now
form an artificial dataset for training an error de-
tector. Duplicate instances and corrupted sen-
tences with more than 5 errors were dropped to
remove noise from the downstream training.

4 Experiments

We evaluated our approach on the First Certificate
of English (FCE) error detection dataset (Rei and
Yannakoudakis, 2016), as well as on two human-
annotated test sets (CoNLL1, CoNLL2) from the
CoNLL 2014 shared task (Ng et al., 2014). The
CoNLL data sets pose a unique challenge; as they
are different in style and domain from FCE, we

have no matching training data. We compared
the effect of different neural generation proce-
dures (AM, TS, BS) and contrasted the down-
stream performance of a bidirectional LSTM with
an elaborate sequence labeller.

4.1 Implementation details

NMT training and corruption: We minimally
modified the open source implementation1 of Britz
et al. (2017) to implement TS and BS.2 We trained
our NMT with a single-layered encoder and de-
coder with cell size 256, on the parallel cor-
pus version of FCE (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011),
with early stopping after the FCE development
set score dropped consistently for 20 epochs. We
introduced errors into three datasets: FCE it-
self (450K tokens), the English Vocabulary Pro-
file or EVP (270K tokens) and a subset of Simple
Wikipedia or SW (8.4M tokens); of these, FCE
and EVP were both used in artificial error genera-
tion via SMT and pattern extraction (PAT) by Rei
et al. (2017), enabling us to make a fair experi-
mental comparison. Ten corrupted versions using
each of AM, TS (τ = 0.05) and BS were sam-
pled for FCE and EVP corruptions, while one suf-
ficed for SW. The theoretical time complexity of
BS is O(bn) for each sentence, where b is num-

of a sentence. Empirically, BS with b = 11 took
a factor of 11.3 more time than AM. Examples of
generated errors are provided in Table 1.

Error detection: We compare two error detec-
tion models: a vanilla bi-directional LSTM (BiL-
STM) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997), and the state-
of-the-art sequence labeller (SL) neural network
used by Rei et al. (2017). These models were
trained on the binary-labelled FCE training set
augmented with the corrupted instances. Wher-
ever no model is explicitly stated, the SL model
was used. During training, we alternate between
the annotated FCE dataset and the synthetic col-
lection. This alternating protocol prevents over-
fitting on FCE; once it shifts back, it reinforces
connections made from the helpful synthetic cor-
ruptions while forgetting about the noisy ones.

4.2 Results

The results for our baselines and data augmenta-
tion strategies can be found in Table 2. Augmented
with our NMT generated data, even our vanilla
downstream BiLSTM outperforms the SMT+PAT
artificial error augmentation approach of Rei et al.
(2017), indicating that our process better gener-
alises the error information in the source dataset.
Using the more powerful SL network bests the
previous state of the art by over 5% on the FCE
test. Most intriguingly, we note a significant im-
provement for the CoNLL tests using corruptions
from out-of-domain SW. Figure 2 illustrates how
we gain performance on these tests with increas-
ing amounts of corrupted SW, which does not hold
true for corrupted FCE. This shows that we were

able to induce useful errors into a corpus with a
large unseen vocabulary and different syntactic bi-
ases, and this in turn proved valuable for detect-
ing errors in a third domain, suggesting that our
method can transfer learned distributions across
stylistic genres.

Using EVP as a standard source, Figure 1 illus-
trates the variance of the different sampling meth-
ods. All generation methods yield corruptions that
significantly improve test performance, with in-
stances sampled by beam-search consistently out-
performing the alternatives.

5 Discussion

5.1 Error distribution

The original FCE dataset was annotated using the
error taxonomy specified in Nicholls (2003), and
contains 75 unique error codes. We annotated
samples of EVP corrupted by all three sampling
methods, at a reduced resolution, to compare the
distribution of errors across FCE and the synthetic
corpora. These are presented in Table 3.

At a high level, NMT generates errors more of-
ten among more common parts-of-speech, favour-
ing errors in verbs and nouns, rather than in ad-
verbs and conjunctions. It did not make spelling
errors as often as in the source dataset; this
is likely because it only observed the specific
spelling errors present in FCE, and as the vocab-
ulary is restricted to that dataset, it does not en-
counter those words as frequently in EVP, and thus
rarely makes the same spelling mistakes.

Additionally, the differences in these distribu-
tions can partially be attributed to the implicit dif-
ferences between us and the annotators of FCE.

5.2 Comparison with human errors

To check if the synthetic instances passed for
human-like, we mixed 50 generated sentences
among an equal number of actual ungrammatical
instances from FCE-dev and tasked a human eval-
uator to identify the artificial statements, in a sim-
ple Turing-style test. We created three such sets,
one for each of our sampling techniques, and the
test subject aimed to identify synthetic samples
with high confidence. Results of this test are pre-
sented in Table 4.

The high precision but low recall scores suggest
that while it is still possible to spot some corrup-
tions that are quite clearly artificial, the bulk of our
samples do not betray their synthetic nature and
are indistinguishable from naturally occurring er-
roneous sentences. In order to fairly compare our
work with earlier results, we intended to conduct
such a test for sentences generated by the SMT
of Rei et al. (2017). Unfortunately, we were only
able to source corruptions of FCE-train via this
method; therefore, we decided not to perform this
test as its results cannot be compared to ours.

6 Conclusions and future work

We presented a novel data augmentation tech-
nique for grammatical error detection using neu-
ral machine translation to learn the distribution
of language-learner errors, and induce such er-
rors into grammatically correct text. We explored
several different variants of sampling to improve
the quality of our synthetic errors. After creat-
ing artificial training instances with an off-the-
shelf NMT, we bettered previous state-of-the-art
results on the canonical test with even a basic BiL-
STM, and established a new state of the art using
a stronger model. Additionally, we demonstrated
that we were able to leverage corruptions of an
out-of-domain dataset to set new benchmarks on
separate, also out-of-domain tests, without specif-
ically optimising for either.

Our work indicates that neural error genera-
tion warrants further investigation with different
datasets and architectures, both for error detec-
tion and error correction. Among possible fu-
ture work is using generative adversarial networks
as corruption engines, and developing better se-
quence alignment methods. Some preliminary re-
sults with simple corruptions using word substitu-
tion and word dropout (Iyyer et al., 2015) appear
to be promising, and may feature as components of
a future corruption system. Finally, one could use
such artificial error-prone corpora as source text
for self-training an error detection system.
