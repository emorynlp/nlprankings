Abstract 

In this paper we give an overview of 

Computational Linguistics / Natural 

Language Processing in Brazil, describing the 

general research scenario, the main research 

groups, existing events and journals, and the 

perceived challenges, among other relevant 

information. We also identify opportunities 

for collaboration. 

1 Brazilian Research Scenario 

Computational Linguistics (CL) / Natural 

Language Processing (NLP) is an emerging and 

growing area in Brazil. Although there is no 

consensus, it is traditionally understood as a 

research field within Artificial Intelligence, 

gathering researchers mainly from Computer 

Science/Engineering and Linguistics. There is also 

modest interaction with Information Sciences area. 

In general the CL/NLP area in Brazil started 

with researchers that finished their PhD abroad 

and, after coming back, initiated the first CL/NLP 

projects. Since then, but mainly more recently, the 

area has experienced some internationalization due 

to the fact that the number of undergraduate and 

graduate students that undergo internships on 

renowned foreign NLP research centers has 

increased. In Brazil, PhD students have the 

possibility to take their complete PhD course 

abroad or, alternatively, only a part of it. In both 

cases, students may count on Brazilian funding 

agencies. 

The area is more strongly represented and 

promoted by Brazilian Computer Society (SBC)
1
, 

particularly by its Special Interest Group on NLP 

(CEPLN)
2
, created in 2007. It is interesting that 

most researchers in Brazil (independent from their 

background area) do not differentiate CL from 

NLP, using both terms interchangeably. 

Research in Brazil is carried out mainly at 

public universities and at a few private universities 

and business companies. Differently from most 

countries, in Brazil public universities are 

generally considered the top ones, although 

exceptions do exist. 

Currently, there are no undergraduate courses on 

CL/NLP in Brazil, therefore researchers in this 

field come mainly from Computer Science and 

Linguistics courses. However, there are a few 

graduate courses on CL/NLP, with both computing 

and language emphases, such as the MSc and PhD 

programs at USP/São Carlos
3
, UFSCar

4
, 

UNESP/Araraquara
5
, PUC-RS

6
, and UFRGS

7
, 

among others.

Funding for research comes mainly from 

governmental agencies. Nowadays Brazil has 4 

agencies that significantly support research in the 

country (in this order): CNPq8 (National Council 

for Scientific and Technological Development), 

FAPESP
9
 (São Paulo Research Foundation), 

CAPES
10

 (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de 

Pessoal de Nível Superior), and FINEP
11

 (Research 

and Projects Financing). Private funding is still 

modest, which reflects the limited interaction 

between universities and companies. Some of the 

above agencies have tried to change this scenario 

by providing special joint university-industry 

funding programs. For instance, FAPESP and 

Microsoft Research recently formed a partnership 

to fund socially relevant projects in the state of São 

Paulo, e.g., the PorSimples
12

 text simplification 

project. FAPESP also funds special university-

company programs, where the research to be 

developed must be of interest to a company, which, 

in turn, has to support the research and work 

together with the researchers. 

NLP research in Brazil is varied and deals not 

only with Portuguese processing, but also with 

English and Spanish mainly. Given that Portuguese 

is among the most spoken languages in the world 

(it is estimated that almost 250 million people 

speak some variant of Portuguese in the world
13

), 

research interests on Portuguese processing is 

shared with other countries, mainly Portugal. In 

this sense, Portugal has launched an initiative to 

create and maintain a unified information storage 

center that indexes resources and publications 

for/on Portuguese processing. The initiative is the 

Linguateca project
14

, which was officially created 

in 2002, but initial works date back to 1998. Santos 

(2009) presents and evaluates the work carried out 

by Linguateca. 

Brazil and Portugal have a history of partnership 

on Portuguese processing, which formally started 

in 1993 with the first PROPOR conference 

(PROPOR event series is introduced in Section 4).

10 http://www.capes.gov.br 
11 http://www.finep.gov.br 
12 http://caravelas.icmc.usp.br 
13 Besides Brazil and Portugal, Portuguese is an official 

language in Angola, Cape Verde, East Timor, Equatorial 

Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Macau, Mozambique, and São Tomé 

and Príncipe. 
14 http://www.linguateca.pt 

We maintain this partnership active by having 

collaborative projects and promoting joint events.  

As far as we know, other Portuguese speaking 

countries do not have a tradition of CL/NLP 

research. However, curiously, there are researchers 

from other non-Portuguese speaking countries that 

develop relevant research on Portuguese language. 

For example, to the best of our knowledge, 

currently the best syntactical parsers for 

Portuguese were developed by researchers from 

Denmark and the USA. These researchers actively 

work with the Brazilian research community. 

In what follows, we briefly present the Brazilian 

research profile (Section 2), the main research 

groups (Section 3), and the Brazilian events and 

journals (Section 4). We also report the main 

challenges for research in Brazil (Section 5) and 

the collaboration opportunities with other 

American researchers that we envision (Section 6). 

2 Research Profile 

In 2009 CEPLN proposed a survey of the status of 

CL/NLP research in Brazil and published the 

results during the 7th Brazilian Symposium in 

Information and Human Language Technology 

(Pardo et al., 2009). The survey aimed at gathering 

information both about researchers (such as their 

location, education level, number of students, etc.) 

and their research (main research topics, number of 

funded projects, main challenges, etc.). 

The survey was carried out mainly on-line. A 

call for participation was sent to all known e-mail 

lists from scientific associations from varied areas. 

Data was also obtained from the Registry of Latin 

American Researchers in Natural Language 

Processing and Computational Linguistics
15

. 

148 researchers responded to the survey: 35% of 

these were academic staff with a PhD degree, 16% 

academic staff with a Master's degree, 1% 

academic staff with a Bachelors degree, 9% PhD 

students, 26% Master's students, 14% 

undergraduate students, and 5% others. Table 1 

summarizes the main results of the survey, 

showing the percentage of answers for each issue. 

One may see that CL/NLP research is mainly 

carried out in the south and southeast regions of 

Brazil.

Figure 1. Research topics 

 

The survey also inquired the participants about 

their research topics. Figure 1 shows the 

distribution of topics among researchers who 

responded to the survey. Researchers could mark 

as many research topics as they wanted. Some 

topics subsume others, so these were marked more 

often by respondents. 

Ontologies and semantics were the topics 

marked by most respondents. We believe that there 

is indeed a significant number of researchers 

working on them, but we also believe that they are 

not the main topic of research of most people who 

3



listed them. For example, the statistics for 

“Ontologies” probably also include researchers 

who simply make use of ontologies in their work 

and not necessarily develop ontologies or ontology 

generation methods. Other researchers believe that 

we are in a changing period, moving from syntax-

centered research to semantics-centered research, 

due to the fact that more recently the community 

has produced more robust semantic tools and 

resources, e.g., the first versions of Portuguese 

language wordnets, as TeP 2.0
16

, Wordnet.PT
17

, 

and MWN.PT
18

, as well as named entities 

recognizers, e.g., REMBRANDT
19

. 

Interestingly, corpus linguistics is one of the 

hottest topics but, at the same time, it is not seen as 

a genuine CL/NLP topic: most researchers that 

indicated corpus linguistics as a research topic 

marked it as “other area of interest”. Some 

researchers have advocated that CL/NLP area and 

corpus linguistics should be considered a unique 

area, while others argue that these areas have 

different purposes and, therefore, different 

scientific methods, what would avoid such 

unification. Text mining is another curious case: 

research on this theme is mostly carried out by 

non-CL/NLP researchers, but instead by 

researchers on general AI and database areas 

Based on the publications on the last Brazilian 

scientific events and on the fact that we personally 

know most of the CL/NLP researchers in Brazil, 

we dare to indicate the following topics as the most 

recurrent ones (in no particular order): text 

summarization, machine translation, text 

simplification, automatic discourse analysis, 

coreference and anaphora resolution, information 

retrieval, text mining, terminology/lexicon 

research, ontologies and semantic tagging, and 

corpus linguistics. 

Based on the survey, we estimate that Brazil has 

about 250 researchers (including students) with 

interest in CL/NLP area. Although only 148 

researchers attended the CEPLN survey, we 

computed other researchers in the Registry of Latin 

American Researchers in Natural Language 

Processing and Computational Linguistics and in 

the CEPLN e-mail list that did not attend the 

survey. In general, we estimate that about 35-40 of

17 http://www.clul.ul.pt/clg/wordnetpt 
18 http://mwnpt.di.fc.ul.pt 
19 http://xldb.di.fc.ul.pt/Rembrandt 

these are active researchers, whose main topic of 

research is CL/NLP, and who supervise 

undergraduate and graduate students on the 

subject. We also estimate that there are 5-10 

researchers on speech processing that actively 

collaborate with the CL/NLP community. 

3 Main research groups 

The largest CL/NLP research group in Brazil is 

NILC (Interinstitutional Center for Research and 

Development in Computational Linguistics)
20

, 

which includes researchers mainly from University 

of São Paulo (USP; Computer Science and Physics 

departments), Federal University of São Carlos 

(UFSCar; Computer Science and Linguistics 

departments) and State University of São Paulo 

(UNESP; Linguistics department). The group was 

created at 1993. 

NILC has a long history of research in CL/NLP, 

which has thrived since the ReGra
21

 project, in 

which the grammar checker for Portuguese that is 

currently used within Microsoft Word since its 

2000 version was built. In fact, ReGra project was 

born from a university-industry collaboration, one 

of the few successful ones in CL/NLP area in 

Brazil. At the moment most of the research at 

NILC is concentrated on the following topics: 

automatic summarization, text simplification, 

coreference resolution, and terminology. NILC has 

hosted STIL 2009 (STIL event series is introduced 

in the next section). NILC also currently holds the 

presidency of CEPLN. 

The NLP group at the Computer Science 

department at the Catholic University of Rio 

Grande do Sul (PUC-RS)22 also has a tradition of 

research on CL/NLP. Their current projects focus 

on information retrieval, ontology engineering and 

anaphora resolution. The group also has research 

on multi-agent systems applied to NLP tasks and, 

more recently, on text categorization. The group 

hosts PROPOR 2010 (PROPOR event series is 

also introduced in the next section). The group has 

held the presidency of CEPLN from its creation 

(2007) until 2009. 

The above research group and NILC form the 

main CL/NLP research vein in Brazil. They have 

joint research projects and have strong

collaboration, constantly hosting graduate students 

from each other in internship research periods. 

There are also other very relevant NLP groups 

in Brazil that regularly carry out projects on the 

area. We may cite the Catholic University of Rio 

de Janeiro (PUC-Rio)
23

, Federal University of Rio 

Grande do Sul (UFRGS), State University of 

Campinas (UNICAMP), University of the Sinos 

River Valley (Unisinos), and State University of 

Maringá (UEM), among others. 

4 Events and Journals 

The Brazilian Symposium on Information and 

Human Language Technology (STIL) is the main 

event on CL/NLP in South America and is in its 

seventh edition. It is promoted by CEPLN and is 

carried out since 1993. It is intended to be a forum 

for gathering everyone with interest in CL/NLP. It 

happens regularly (every one or two years) and 

accepts contributions in Portuguese, Spanish and 

English. Details about the event are available at 

www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/til. 

The International Conference on Computational 

Processing of Portuguese Language (PROPOR) is 

an international conference jointly promoted by 

Brazil and Portugal and is in its ninth edition. It is 

the main conference with focus on Portuguese 

language, giving equal space to research on text 

and speech processing. It is carried out in Brazil 

and in Portugal interchangeably (every two or 

three years) and accepts submissions in English 

only. PROPOR’s proceedings are published as part 

of Springer Lecture Notes series. Details about the 

event are available at 

www.nilc.icmc.usp.br/cgpropor. 

STIL and PROPOR are the most relevant 

conferences for researchers in CL/NLP in Brazil. 

Their last editions received support from NAACL. 

AI events are also recurrent forums for CL/NLP 

researchers. The Brazilian AI events are the 

Brazilian Symposium on Artificial Intelligence 

(SBIA)
24

 and the National Meeting on Artificial 

Intelligence (ENIA)
25

, also promoted by SBC. 

They are already in their twentieth and seventh 

editions, respectively. 

Other related events in Brazil are the Corpus

 www.letras.puc-rio.br/Clic/ogrupo.htm 
24 http://www.jointconference.fei.edu.br/ 
25 http://csbc2009.inf.ufrgs.br/ 

Linguistics Meeting (ELC)
26

 and Brazilian School 

on Computational Linguistics (EBRALC)
27

, which 

are in their eighth and third editions, respectively. 

These events are mainly organized by the 

Linguistics research community. EBRALC is 

mainly intended for new students in the area and 

has been held together with ELC. 

Brazilian researchers count mainly on the 

following journals for national periodical 

publications: 

� JBCS28 (Journal of the Brazilian Computer 
Society), which is published by SBC and 

covers all Computer Science areas, including 

CL/NLP; 

� RITA29 (Journal of Theoretical and Applied 
Computing), also of general scope. 

 

It is important to cite Linguamática
30

, which is an 

European initiative to publish CL/NLP research on 

the Iberian languages. 

CEPLN is also organizing a joint journal with 

other SBC AI-related special interest groups. 

5 Challenges 

At STIL 2009, the research community discussed 

challenging issues (raised by respondents of the 

CEPLN survey) that hamper research on CL/PLN 

in Brazil. The main issues raised were: 

� Lack of large and robust language resources 
for Portuguese; 

� Lack of formal models for linguistic 
description and analysis of Portuguese; 

� Difficulty in attracting students and researchers 
to the area; 

� Lack of multidisciplinary collaboration; 
� CL/NLP marginalization in both Computer 

Science and Linguistics. 

� Poor interaction between universities and 
industry; 

� Insufficient funding. 
 

Here we discuss some of these points. Although 

Portuguese has got state of the art tools (as POS 

taggers and syntactic parsers) and comprehensive 

corpora of contemporary written language, there is 

                                                           
26 http://www.corpuslg.org/elc/Inicial.html

29 http://www.seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/rita 
30 http://linguamatica.pt

still a need for resources for particular applications 

or domains. Many researchers feel that Portuguese 

syntactic parsers (which are considered basic NLP 

tools) and wordnet-like resources are still too 

limited, not attending their demands. Brazil also 

lacks representative spoken corpora, what may be 

explained by the fact that, in Brazil, written and 

spoken language processing communities have 

modest interaction. While written language 

processing research is reported at SBC events, 

spoken language processing is mainly conducted 

under SBrT (Brazilian Telecommunications 

Society)
31

. PROPOR series have tried to bring 

together these two communities, fostering joint 

research and mutual awareness of both research 

lines.  

The lack of formal models for Portuguese 

linguistic description and analysis was mainly 

perceived by linguists that work with CL/NLP. In 

fact, they acknowledge that Brazil has no tradition 

in carrying out events on these themes, what would 

eventually harm CL/NLP research. This goes along 

with Spärck Jones (2007) opinion paper. One first 

step towards overcoming this lack of formal 

models for Portuguese description was the 

Workshop on Portuguese Description
32

, carried out 

together with the last edition of STIL. 

Another point that deserves attention is the 

sentiment that CL/NLP research suffers from 

marginalization in both Computer Science and 

Linguistics areas, as it is usually the case for 

multidisciplinary subjects. We believe this might 

be fueled by the way research is assessed in Brazil. 

In Brazil, the quality of research is mainly assessed 

by the publications generated from it, and 

publication vehicles from Linguistics are usually 

rated worse in Computer Science, and vice versa. It 

is expected that different areas may have different 

scientific methods and perspectives, as well as it is 

natural that such differences are mirrored in any 

evaluation instrument. However, such factors lead 

some researchers to feel uncomfortable with the 

multidisciplinary nature of CL/NLP field and the 

way they are recognized in their own major areas. 

Many researchers (not only from Brazil, but also 

from Portugal) have supported that CL/NLP should 

become a new “major” area, instead of being part 

of Computer Science or Linguistics. 

                                                           
31 http://www.sbrt.org.br 
32 http://www.ppgl.ufscar.br/jdp/index.html 

Concerning insufficient funding, we believe that 

the main complaints came from Brazilian regions 

other than south and southeast, which currently 

concentrate CL/NLP research. In fact, during a 

lengthy discussion at STIL 2009 about the raised 

challenges, this issue was dismissed by many 

participants as non-representative. We believe that 

the funding situation in each region of Brazil 

contributes to the status of research on all topics, 

not particularly CL/NLP, in these regions. While 

in most Brazilian states researchers have to 

compete for funding from national agencies, some 

states (mainly in the southeast region) can rely on 

strong state-based funding agencies, such as 

FAPESP, in the state of São Paulo. 

6 Opportunities for Collaboration 

We believe that there are many opportunities for 

collaboration on CL/NLP with other researchers in 

the Americas, mainly due to the fact that the 

research community in Brazil works not only with 

Portuguese, but also with English and Spanish. 

One first step towards collaboration in Latin 

America was given in the event CHARLA 2008 

(Grand Challenges in Computer Science Research 

in Latin America Workshop). Organized by several 

scientific societies (including SBC), the event 

aimed at contributing to the definition of a long-

term research agenda in Latin America with the 

potential to significantly advance science and 

motivate the networking of abilities and 

competencies in Latin America. One of the 

recognized challenges was “multilinguism”, which 

involves several CL/NLP topics. CHARLA 

immediate impact in Brazil was the adaptation of 

Brazilian CL/NLP events to receive contributions 

in Spanish, which has a vast number of speakers in 

Latin America. Contributions in English were 

already traditionally considered in Brazilian 

events. 

We believe that another important source of 

collaboration comes from awareness of the 

ongoing research projects in the Americas. 

Workshops such as this seem to be a channel for 

the exchange of information. We envision that 

initial collaborations may arise within machine 

translation projects, which naturally already deal 

with the representative languages of the Americas. 

Letting aside technical collaboration, we believe 

there is room for higher-level concrete actions that 

6



could foster collaboration in the Americas. These 

are actions that may increase the visibility of the 

research done in Latin America, as well as 

motivate new research. One first action that we 

envisage is the opening of evaluation challenges 

and shared tasks to the languages of the Americas 

other than English. For instance, 

contests/conferences such as TAC
33

, 

Senseval/SemEval
34

, and TREC
35

, among others, 

might make Portuguese/Spanish datasets available, 

as CLEF
36

 has done in its last editions. This has 

certainly an organizational cost, but it may turn out 

to be a valuable investment.  

Another action that could stimulate the progress 

of CL/NLP research in Latin America consists of 

including the proceedings of other American 

CL/NLP conferences in the ACL Anthology
37

, for 

example, the proceedings of STIL and PROPOR, 

to mention the Brazilian examples. This could be 

restricted to conferences that received 

ACL/NAACL endorsement and/or sponsorship.  

While the first action we proposed would make 

it feasible for more countries to participate in the 

evaluation contests, the second action would allow 

the works carried out in these countries to be better 

known. 

In a different strategy, we imagine that it must 

be possible for regional scientific associations to 

establish formal partnerships, granting some 

advantages to associated researchers from the 

corresponding countries, such as: registration 

discounts in the CL/NLP conferences from the 

countries (for instance, ACL/NAACL members 

would have discounts for registering in Brazilian 

events, as well as SBC members for ACL/NAACL 

events); and distribution of relevant publications 

for members of the associations (for instance, SBC 

traditionally distributes to its members the JBCS 

journal, which is considered a prestigious 

international publication). 

Our last idea would be to create a fund (possibly 

through the associations’ partnership) for funding 

visits for knowledge transfer (1-2 weeks) for 

researchers and mainly students. These could be an 

opportunity for studying/working with researchers 

from other countries that work on topics of 

                                                           
33 http://www.nist.gov/tac 
34 http://www.senseval.org 
35 http://trec.nist.gov 
36 http://www.clef-campaign.org 
37 http://aclweb.org/anthology-new 

interest, as well as for renowned researchers to 

visit research groups in order to stimulate work on 

a particular topic. Such opportunities would be 

very positive for Brazilian students. 

We believe that the actions suggested above can 

lead to a more integrated research scenario in the 

Americas.
