Abstract

For millions of people in less resourced re-
gions of the world, text messages (SMS) pro-
vide the only regular contact with their doc-
tor. Classifying messages by medical labels
supports rapid responses to emergencies, the
early identification of epidemics and everyday
administration, but challenges include text-
brevity, rich morphology, phonological vari-
ation, and limited training data. We present
a novel system that addresses these, working
with a clinic in rural Malawi and texts in the
Chichewa language. We show that model-
ing morphological and phonological variation
leads to a substantial average gain of F=0.206
and an error reduction of up to 63.8% for spe-
cific labels, relative to a baseline system opti-
mized over word-sequences. By comparison,
there is no significant gain when applying the
same system to the English translations of the
same texts/labels, emphasizing the need for
subword modeling in many languages. Lan-
guage independent morphological models per-
form as accurately as language specific mod-
els, indicating a broad deployment potential.

1 Introduction

The whole world is texting, but rarely in English.
Africa has seen the greatest recent uptake of cell-
phones, with an 8-fold increase over the last 5 years
and saturation possible in another 5 (Buys et al.,
2009). This is a leapfrog technology – for the ma-
jority of new users cellphones are the only form of
remote communication, surpassing landlines, (non-
mobile) internet access and even grid electricity,

with costs making texts the dominant communica-
tion method. This has led social development orga-
nizations to leverage mobile technologies to support
health (Leach-Lemens, 2009), banking (Peevers et
al., 2008), access to market information (Jagun et al.,
2008), literacy (Isbrandt, 2009) and emergency re-
sponse (Munro, 2010). The possibility to automate
many of these services through text-classification is
huge, as are the potential benefits – those with the
least resources have the most to gain.

However, the data presents many challenges, as
text messages are brief, most languages have rich
morphology, spellings may be overly-phonetic, and
there is often limited training data. We partnered
with a medical clinic in rural Malawi and Front-
lineSMS:Medic, whose text message management
systems serve a patient population of over 2 million
in less developed regions of the world. The system
allows remote community health workers (CHWs)
to communicate directly with more qualified medi-
cal staff at centralized clinics, many for the first time.

We present a short-message classification sys-
tem that incorporates morphological and phono-
logical/orthographic variation, with substantial im-
provements over a system optimized on word-
sequences alone. The average gain is F=0.206 with
an error reduction of up to 63.8% for specific labels.
For 6 of the 9 labels this more than doubles the accu-
racy. By comparison, there is not a significant gain
in accuracy when applying the same system to the
English translations of the same texts/labels, empha-
sizing the need for modeling subword structures, but
also highlighting why morphology has been periph-
eral in text classification until now.

2 Language and data

Chichewa is a Bantu language with about 13 mil-
lion speakers in Southern Africa including 65%
of Malawians. We limit examples to the nouns:
odwala ‘patient’, mankhwala ‘medicine’; verb: fun
‘want’; and the 1st person pronoun/marker: ndi-
‘I’. Chichewa is closely related to many neighbor-
ing languages – more than 100 million people could
recognize ndifuna as ‘I want’.

The morphological complexity is average with
about 2-3 morpheme boundaries per word, but this is
rich and complex compared to estimates for English,
Spanish and Chinese with average of 0.33, 0.85 and
0.01 morpheme boundaries per word. A typical verb
is ndimakafunabe, ‘I am still wanting’, consisting
of six morphemes, ndi-ma-ka-fun-a-be, expressing:
1st person Subject; present tense; noun-class (gen-
der) agreement with the Object; ‘want’; verb part-
of-speech; and incompletive aspect.

2.1 Labels
The text messages are coded for 0-9 labels in 3
groupings (with counts):

Administrative: related to the clinic:
1. Patient-related (394)
2. Clinic-admin: meetings, supplies etc (169)
3. Technological: phone-credit, batteries etc (21)

Requests: from Community Health Workers:
4. Response: any action requested by CHW (124)
5. Request for doctor (62)
6. Medical advice: CHW asking for advice (23)

Illness: changes of interest to monitoring bodies:
7. TB: tuberculosis (44)
8. HIV: HIV, AIDS and/or treatments (45)
9. Death: reported death of a patient (30)

The groupings correspond to the three main stake-
holders of the messages: the clinic itself, interested
in classifying messages according to internal work-
practices; the Community Health Workers and their
patients, acting as the direct care-givers outside the
clinic; and broader bodies like the World Health Or-
ganization who are interested in monitoring diseases
and early identification of epidemics (biosurveil-
lance). The labels are the three most frequent labels
required by each of these user groups.

We analyzed 4 months of texts messages with ap-
proximately 1,500 labels from 600 messages, con-

sisting of 8,000 words and 30,000 morphemes.
While this is small, the final system is being piloted
at a clinic in rural Malawi, where users can define
new labels at any time according to changing work-
practices, new diseases etc. If more than 4 months
of manually labeling were required it could limit the
utility and user acceptance.

All the messages were translated into English by
a medical practitioner, allowing us to make cross-
linguistic comparisons of our system.

2.2 Variation

The variation in the data is large. There are >40
forms for ‘patient’ and only 32% are odwala. Of the
rest, >50% occur only once. The variation results
from morphology: ndi-odwala; phonology: odwara,
ndiwodwala, and compounding: ndatindidziwewod-
wala. There are also >10 spellings for the English
borrowing: patient, pachenti etc, and 3 for the syn-
onym matenda.

Similarly, there are >20 forms for ‘medicine’.
For fun ‘want’, there are >30 forms with >80% oc-
curing only once. There are >200 forms containing
ndi and no one form accounts for more than 5% of
the instances.

The co-occurrence of ndi and fun within a word is
a strong non-redundant predictor for several labels,
but >75% of forms occur only once and >85% of
the forms are non-contiguous, as above and in the
most frequent ndi-ma-funa ‘I currently want’.

By contrast, in the English translations ‘needing’
occurs just once but all other forms of ‘patient’,
‘medicine’ and ‘(I) want/need’ are frequent.

This brief introduction to the language and data
should make it clear that specialized methods are re-
quired for modeling variation in text messages, es-
pecially in many languages where text messaging is
the dominant form of digital communication.

3 Morphological models

We compared language specific and language inde-
pendent morphological models, comparing 3 meth-
ods (with ndimafuna as an example):

Stemmed: {ndi, fun}
Segmented: {ndi, ma, fun, a}
Morph-config: {ndi-ma, ndi-fun, ndi-a, ma-fun...}

511



We also looked at character ngrams, as used by Hi-
dalgo et al. (2006) for morphological variation in
English and Spanish. The results converged with
those of the segmented model, which is not surpris-
ing as the most frequent features would be simi-
lar and increasing data items would overcome the
sparcity. We leave more sophisticated character
ngram modeling for future work.

3.1 Language specific
For the language specific morphological models
we implemented a morphological parser as a set
of context-free grammars for all possible prefixes
and suffixes according to the formal definitions of
Chichewa morphology in Mchombo (2004).

We identified stems by parsing potential prefixes
and suffixes, segmenting a word w into n mor-
phemes wm,0, . . . , wm,n−1 leaving a stem ws with
length len(ws) and corpus frequency of f(ws), such
that len(ws) > 0 (ie, there must be a stem). Where
multiple parses could be applied, we minimized
len(ws), then maximized n.

3.2 Language independent
For the language independent morphological mod-
els we adapted the word-segmenter of Goldwa-
ter, Griffiths and Johnson (2009), to morphological
parsing (see Related Work for other algorithms we
tested/considered). It was suited to our task because
a) it is largely nonparametric, meaning that it can
be deployed as a black-box before language-specific
properties are known b) it favored recall over preci-
sion (see the Results for discussion) and c) using a
segmentation algorithm, rather than explicitly mod-
eling morphology, also addresses compounds.

This model uses a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
(HDP) (Teh et al., 2005). Every morpheme in the
corpus mi is drawn from a distribution G which con-
sists of possible morphemes (the affixes and stems)
and probabilities associated with each morpheme. G
is generated from a Dirichlet Process (DP) distri-
bution DP (α0, P0), with morphemes sampled from
P0 and their probabilities determined by a concen-
tration parameter α0. The context-sensitive model
where Hm is the DP for a specific morpheme is:

mi|mi−1 = m,Hm∼Hm ∀m
Hm|α1, G ∼DP (α1, G) ∀m

G|α0, P ∼DP (α0, P0)

Note that this part of our model is identical to the
bigram HDP in Goldwater et al. (2009), except that
we possess a set of morphemes, not words. Because
word boundaries are already marked in the major-
ity of the messages, we constrain the model to treat
all existing word boundaries in the corpus as mor-
pheme boundaries, thus constraining the model to
morpheme and compound segmentation.

Unlike word-segmentation, not all tokens in the
morpheme lexicon are equal, as we want to model
stems separately from affixes in the stemmed mod-
els. We assume a) the free morphemes (stems and
through compounding) are the least frequent and
therefore have the lowest final probability, P (m), in
the HDP model; and b) each word w must have at
least one free morpheme, the stem ws (ws 6= ∅).1

The token-optimal process for identifying
stems is straightforward and efficient. The
words are sorted by the argmin probabilities
of P (wm,0), . . . , P (wm,n−1). For each word
w, unless ws can be identified by a previously
observed free morpheme, ws is identified as
argmin(P (wm,0), . . . , P (wm,n−1)) and ws is
added to our lexicon of free morphemes. This algo-
rithm iterates over the words with one extra pass to
mark all free morphemes in each word (assuming
that there might be compounds we missed on the
first pass). The cost, where M is the total number
of morphemes and W the total number of words, is
O(log(W ) + M).

This process has the potential to miss free mor-
phemes that only happened to occur in compounds
with less-probable stems, but this did not occur in
our data.

4 Phonological/Orthographic Models

We compared three models of phonologi-
cal/orthographic variation:

Chichewa: Chichewa specific
Script: Roman script specific
Indep: language independent

We refer to these using the term ‘phonology’ very
broadly. The majority of the variation stems from

1Note that identifying stems must be a separate step – if we
allowed multiple free morphemes for each word to enter the
lexicon without penalty in the HDP model it would converge on
a zero-penalty distribution where all morphemes were free.

512



the phonology, but also from phonetic variation as
expressed in a given writing system, and variation in
the writing system itself arising from fluent speakers
with varying literacy.

4.1 Chichewa specific

For the language specific normalization, we applied
a set of heuristics to the data, based on the varia-
tion given in (Paas, 2005) and our own knowledge
of how Bantu languages are expressed in Roman
scripts. The heuristics were used to normalize all
alternates, eg: {iwo → i∅o} and {r → l}, resulting
in ndiwodwara → ndiodwala.

The heuristics represented forms for phonemes
with the same potential place of articulation (‘c/k’),
forms with an adjacent place-of-articulation that are
common phonological alternates (‘l/r’, ‘e,i’), voic-
ing alternations (‘s/z’), or language-internal phono-
logical processes like the insertion of a glide be-
tween vowels that the morphology has made adja-
cent (like we pronounce but don’t spell in ‘go(w)ing’
in English).

We also implemented hard-coded acronym-
recovery methods for acronyms associated with the
‘Illness’ labels: ‘HIV’, ‘TB’, ‘AIDS’, ‘ARV’.

4.2 Script specific

The script specific techniques used the same sets of
alternates in the language specific model, but nor-
malized such that the heuristic H was applied to
a word w in the corpus C resulting in an alternate
w′, iff w′ ∈ C. This method limits the alternates
to those whose existence is supported by the data.
It is therefore more conservative than the previous
method.

For more general acronym identification, we
adapted the method of Schwartz & Hearst (2003).
We created a set of candidate acronyms by iden-
tifying capitalized sequences in non-capitalized
contexts and period-delimited single character se-
quences. All case-insensitive sequences that were
segmented by consistent non-alphabetic characters
were then identified as acronyms, provided that they
ended in a non-alphabetic character. We could not
define a similar acronym-start boundary, as pre-
fixes were often added to acronyms, even when the
acronyms themselves contained spaces, eg: ‘aT. B.’.

4.3 Language independent

For complete language independence we applied a
noise-reduction algorithm to the stream of charac-
ters in order to learn the heuristics that represented
potential phonological alternates by identifying all
minimal pairs of characters sequences (sequences
that alternated by one character, include the absence
of a character).

Given all sequences of characters, we identified
all pairs of sequences of length > l that differed
by one character c1, where c1 could be null. We
then ranked the pairs of alternating sequences by de-
scending length and applied a threshold t, selecting
the t longest sequences, creating alternating patterns
from all pairs. Regardless of l or t, the resulting
heuristics did not resemble those in 4.1 or 4.2.

We did not implement any acronym identification
methods, for obvious reasons.

5 Results

The results are compared to a baseline system op-
timized over word sequences (words and ngrams
but no subword modeling). All results presented
here are from a MaxEnt model using a leave-one-
out cross-validation.

For the English translations of the texts there was
no phonological/orthographic variation beyond that
resulting from morphology, so we only applied the
language independent morphological models.

5.1 Morphology

With the exception of the unsupervised stemming,
all the morphological models led to substantial gains
in accuracy. As Table 1 shows, the most accu-
rate system used the language specific segmenta-
tion, with an average accuracy of F=0.476, a macro-
average gain of 22.4%.

The greatest increase in accuracy occured where
verbs were the best predictors – the words with the
most complex morphology. The ‘Response’ label
showed the greatest relative gain in accuracy for
those with a non-zero baseline, where the accuracy
increased 4-fold from F=0.113 to F=0.442. It is ex-
pected that a label predicated on requests for action
should rely on the isolation of verb stems, but this
is still a very substantial gain. In contrast to this
391.2% gain in accuracy for Chichewa, the gain for

‘Morph-Config, Indep’ model over the Baseline.

English, while still relying on the isolation of verb
stems, only increased the accuracy by 5.4%.

The unsupervised stemming underperformed the
baseline model by 8.9%, due to over-segmentation.
Compared to the Chichewa stemmer, we estimate
that the unsupervised stemmer had 90-95% recall
and 40-50% precision, resulting in over-stemmed to-
kens. However, this seemed to be favor the seg-
mented and morph-config models, as unnecessary
segmentation can be recovered when the tokens
are sequenced or re-configured, with the supervised
model arriving at the optimal weights for each can-
didate token or sequence. This can be seen by com-
paring the stemmed and morph-config results for
the Chichewa-specific and language independent re-
sults. The difference in stemming is 20.7% but for
the morph-config models it is only 2.8%. A loss in
segmentation recall could not be recovered in the
same way, as adjacent non-segmented morphemes
will remain one token. This leads us to conclude that
recall should be weighted more highly than preci-
sion in unsupervised morphological models applied
to supervised classification tasks.

5.2 Phonology

For the phonological models the results in Table 2
show that the script-specific model was the most ac-
curate with an average of F=0.443, a gain of 19.1%
over the baseline.

There are correlations between morphological
variation and phonological variation, with the gains
similar for each label in Table 1 and Table 2. This
is because much phonological variation often arises
from the morphology, as in ndiwodwala where the
glide w is pronounced and variably written be-
tween the vowels made adjacent through morphol-
ogy. It is also because more morphologically com-
plex words are longer and simply have more poten-
tial for phonological and written variation. The were
greater gains in identifying the ‘TB’ and ‘HIV’ la-
bels here than in the morphological models as the
result of acronym identification.

The language independent model did not perform
well. Despite changing the data considerably, there
was little change in the accuracy, indicating that the
changes it made were largely random with respect
to the target concepts. The most frequent alterna-
tions in large contexts were noun-class prefixes dif-
fering by a single character, which has the potential
to change the meaning, and this seemed to negate
any gains from normalization.

While language independent results would have
been ideal, a system with script-specific assump-
tions is realistic. It is likely that text messages are
regularly sent in 1000s of languages but less than
10 scripts, and our definition of ‘script specific’
would be considered ‘language independent’ else-
where. For example, in the Morpho Challenge (see

man script, and it is likely that the methods could be
adapted with some success to any alphabetic script.

5.3 Combined results

Table 3 gives the final results, comparing the sys-
tems over the original text messages and the English
translations of the same messages. The most accu-
rate results were achieved by applying the phono-
logical normalization before the morphological seg-
mentation, giving a (macro) average of 0.459 which
is an increase of 20.6% over the baseline. The
increase in accuracy was not cumulative – the
combined system outperforms both the standalone
phonological and morphological systems, but with a
comparatively modest gain.

The final English system is 9.2% more accurate
than the final Chichewa system, but the Chichewa
system has closed the gap considerably as the En-
glish baseline system was 25.7% more accurate than
the baseline Chichewa system. Assuming that the
potential accuracy is approximately equal (given
both languages are encoding exactly the same infor-
mation) we conclude that we have made substantial
gains in accuracy but there are further large gains to
be made. Therefore, while we have not solved the
problem of text message classification in morpho-
logically rich languages, we have been able to make
promising gains in an exciting new area of research.

5.4 Practical effectiveness

The FrontlineSMS system currently allows users to
filter messages by keywords, similar to many email
clients. Because of the large number of variants per
word this is sub-optimal in many languages. We de-
fined a second baseline to model an idealized version
of the current system that assumes oracle knowledge
of the keyword/label and the optimal order in which
to apply rules created from this knowledge. The only
constraint was that we excluded words that occurred
only once. In essence, it is a MaxEnt model that in-
cludes seen test items and assigns a label according
to the single strongest feature for each test item.

Here, we evaluated the systems according to
Micro-F, recall and precision, as these give a bet-
ter gauge of the frequency of error per incoming
text, and therefore the usability for someone need-
ing to correct mislabeled texts. We also calculated
the Micro-F for each label/non-label decision to give
exact figures per classification decision. The results
are in Table 4. The Micro-F is 0.684 as compared to
0.403 for the keyword system. The higher precision
is also promising, indicating that when we assign a
label we are more often correct. By adjusting the
precision and recall through label confidence thresh-
olds, 90% precision can be achieved with 35.3% re-
call.2 In terms of usability, the Label/no-Label re-

2We confirmed significance relative to confidence by ROC
analysis – results omitted for space.

sults are very promising, reducing errors from 1 in 4
to 1 in 20.

The learning rates in Figure 1 show that the learn-
ers are converging on accurate models after only see-
ing a handful of text messages. This figure also
makes it clear that subword processing gives rela-
tively little gain to the English translations. The
disparity between the final model and the baseline
widens as more items are seen, indicating that the
failure of the word-optimal baseline model is not just
due to a lack of training items.

5.5 Other models investigated

Much recent work in text classification has been in
machine-learning, comparing models over constant
features. We tested SVMs and joint learning strate-
gies. The gains were significant but small and did
not closed the gap between systems with and with-
out subword modeling. We therefore omit these for
space and scope.

However, one interesting result came from ex-
tending the feature space with topics derived from
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using similar
methods to Ramage et al. (2009). This produced
significant gains (micro-F=0.029), halving the re-
maining gap with the English system, but only
when the topics were derived from modeling non-
contiguous morpheme sequences, not words-alone
or segmented morphemes. We found that the differ-
ent surface forms of each word cooccurred less often

than chance (0.46 as often as chance for the different
forms of odwala) forming disjunctive distributions.
We suspect that this acts as a bias against robust un-
supervised clustering of the different forms.

6 Related Work

To our best knowledge, no prior researchers have
worked on subword models for text message cate-
gorization, or any NLP task with the Chichewa, but
we build on many recent developments in computa-
tional morphology and NLP for Bantu languages.

Badenhorst et al. (2009) found substantial varia-
tion in a speech recognition corpus for 9 Southern
Bantu languages, where accurate models could also
be built with limited data. Morphological segmenta-
tion improved Swahili-English machine translation
in De Pauw et al. (2009), even in the absense of
gold standard reference segmentations, as was the
case here. The complexity and necessity of model-
ing non-contiguous morphemes in Bantu languages
is discussed by Pretorius et al. (2009).

Computational morphology (Goldsmith, 2001;
Creutz, 2006; Kurimo et al., 2008; Johnson and
Goldwater, 2009; Goldwater et al., 2009) has be-
gun to play a prominent role in machine transla-
tion and speech recognition for morphologically rich
languages (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Tach-
belie et al., 2009). In the current-state-of-the-art, a
combination of the ParaMor (Monson et al., 2008)

the most accurate results in 2008 Morpho Challenge
Workshop (Kurimo et al., 2008). ParaMor assumes
a single affix and is not easily adapted to more com-
plex morphologies, but we were able to test and eval-
uate Morfessor and the earlier Linguistica (Gold-
smith, 2001). Both were more accurate for segmen-
tation than our adaptation of Goldwater et al. (2009),
but with lower recall. For the reasons discussed in
Section 5.3 this meant less accuracy in classification.
Goldwater et al. have also used the Pitman-Yor algo-
rithm for morphological modeling (Goldwater et al.,
2006). In results too recent to test here, Pitman-Yor
has been used for segmentation with accuracy com-
parable to the HDP model but with greater efficiency
(Mochihashi et al., 2009). Biosurveillance systems
currently use simple rule-based pre-processing for
subword models. Dara et al. (2008) found only mod-
est gains, although the data was limited to English.

For text message classification, prior work is lim-
ited to identifying SPAM (Healy et al., 2005; Hi-
dalgo et al., 2006; Cormack et al., 2007), where
specialized algorithms and feature representations
were also found to improve accuracy. For written
variation, Kobus et al. (2008) focussed on SMS-
specific abbreviations in French. Unlike their data,
SMS-specific abbreviations were not present in our
data. This is consistent with the reports on SMS
practices in the related isiXhosa language (Deumert
and Masinyana, 2008), but it may also be because
the data we used contained professional communi-
cations not personal messages.

7 Conclusions

We have demonstrated that subword modeling in
Chichewa leads to significant gains in classifying
text messages according to medical labels, reducing
the error from 1 in 4 to 1 in 20 in a system that should
generalize to other languages with similar morpho-
logical complexity.

The rapid expansion of cellphone technologies
has meant that digital data is now being generated
in 100s, if not 1000s, of languages that have not
previously been the focus of language technologies.
The results here therefore represent just one of a
large number of potential new applications for short-
message classification systems.
