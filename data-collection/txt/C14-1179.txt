Abstract
While lexicalized reordering models have been widely used in phrase-based translation systems,
they suffer from three drawbacks: context insensitivity, ambiguity, and sparsity. We propose a
neural reordering model that conditions reordering probabilities on the words of both the current
and previous phrase pairs. Including the words of previous phrase pairs significantly improves
context sensitivity and reduces reordering ambiguity. To alleviate the data sparsity problem, we
build one classifier for all phrase pairs, which are represented as continuous space vectors. Ex-
periments on the NIST Chinese-English datasets show that our neural reordering model achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art lexicalized reordering models.

1 Introduction

Reordering plays a crucial role in phrase-based translation (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).
While local reordering can be directly memorized in phrases, modeling reordering at a phrase level still
remains a major challenge: it can be cast as a travelling salesman problem and proves to be NP-complete
(Knight, 1999; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).

The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of phrase reordering models (e.g., (Och et al.,
2004; Tillman, 2004; Zens et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2006; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Koehn et
al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008; Feng et al., 2010; Green et al., 2010; Bisazza and Federico, 2012;
Cherry, 2013), just to name a few). Among them, lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn
et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008) have been widely used in practical phrase-based systems. Un-
like the distance-based reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) that only penalizes phrase displacements
in terms of the degree of nonmonotonicity, lexicalized reordering models introduce reordering probabil-
ities conditioned on the words of each phrase pair. They often distinguish between three orientations
with respect to the previous phrase pair: monotone, swap, and discontinuous. As lexicalized reordering
models capture the phenomenon that some words are far more likely to be displaced than others, they
outperform unlexicalized reordering models substantially.

Despite their apparent success in statistical machine translation, lexicalized reordering models suffer
from the following three drawbacks:

1. Context insensitivity. Lexicalized reordering models determine the orientations only depending on
the words of current phrase pairs. In fact, a phrase pair usually has different orientations in different
contexts. It is important to include more contexts to improve the expressive power of reordering
models.

2. Ambiguity. Short phrase pairs, which are observed in the training data more frequently, usually have
multiple orientations. We observe that about 92.4% of one-word Chinese-English phrase pairs are
ambiguous. This makes it hard to decide which orientation should be properly used in decoding.

Figure 1: Ambiguity in phrase reordering. The phrase pair ⟨“yingyun”, “business”⟩ is labeled with
different orientations in different contexts: (a) monotone, (b) swap, and (c) discontinuous. Lexicalized
reordering models use fixed probability distributions (e.g., 17.50% for M, 1.59% for S, and 80.92% for
D) in decoding even though the surrounding contexts keep changing.

3. Sparsity. Lexicalized reordering models maintain a reordering probability distribution for each
phrase pair. As most long phrase pairs that are capable of memorizing local word selection and
reordering only occur once in the training data, maximum likelihood estimation can hardly train the
models accurately.

In this work, we propose a neural reordering model for phrase-based translation. The contribution is
twofold. Firstly, unlike conventional lexicalized reordering models, the neural reordering model condi-
tions reordering probabilities on the words of both the current and previous phrase pairs. Including the
words of previous phrase pairs significantly improves context sensitivity and reduces reordering ambi-
guity. Secondly, to alleviate the data sparsity problem, we build a neural classifier for all phrase pairs,
which are represented as continuous space vectors. Experiments on the NIST Chinese-English datasets
show that our neural reordering model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art lexicalized
models.

2 Lexicalized Reordering Models

The lexicalized reordering models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007; Galley and Manning, 2008) have
become the de facto standard in modern phrase-based systems. These models are called lexicalized
because they condition reordering probabilities on the words of each phrase pair. Depending on the
relationship between the current and previous phrase pairs, lexicalized reordering models often define
orientations to classify different reordering patterns.

More formally, we use f = {f̃1, . . . , f̃n} to denote a sequence of source phrases, e = {ẽ1, . . . , ẽn}
to denote the phrase sequence on the target side, and a = {a1, . . . , an} to denote the alignment be-
tween source and target phrases. A source phrase f̃ai and a target phrase ẽi form a phrase pair. Lex-
icalized reordering models aim to estimate the conditional probability of a sequence of orientations
o = {o1, . . . , on}:

P (o|f , e,a) =
n∏

i=1

where each oi takes values over a set of predefined orientations. For simplicity, current lexicalized

Table 1: Percentages of phrase pairs that have multiple orientations. Including previous phrase pairs in
modeling significantly reduces the reordering ambiguity for the M/S/D orientations. For example, while
92.74% of 1-word Chinese-English phrase pairs have multiple orientations observed in the training data,
the ratio dramatically drops to 21.72% if the orientations are conditioned on both the current and previous
phrase pairs.

reordering models use orientations conditioned only on ai−1 and ai:

P (o|f , e,a) ≈
n∏

i=1

P (oi|f̃ai , ẽi, ai−1, ai) (2)

The most widely used orientations are monotone (M), swap (S), and discontinuous (D): 1

oi =


M if ai − ai−1 = 1
S if ai − ai−1 = −1
D if |ai − ai−1| ≠ 1

(3)

As lexicalized reordering models maintain a reordering probability distribution for each phrase pair,
it is hard to accurately learn reordering probabilities for long phrase pairs that are usually observed only
once in the training data. On the contrary, short phrase pairs that occur in the training data for many times
tend to be ambiguous. For example, as shown in Figure 1, a Chinese-English phrase pair ⟨“yingyun”,
“business”⟩ is observed to have different orientations in different contexts.

It is unreasonable to use fixed reordering probability distributions in decoding as the surrounding
contexts keep changing. Previous study shows that considering more contexts into reordering modeling
improves translation performance (Khalilov and Simaan, 2010). Therefore, we need a more powerful
mechanism to include more contexts, resolve the reordering ambiguity, and reduce the data sparsity.

3 A Neural Reordering Model

3.1 The Model
Intuitively, conditioning reordering probabilities on the words of both the current and previous phrase
pairs will significantly reduce both reordering ambiguity and context insensitivity. The new reordering
model is given by

P (o|f , e,a) ≈
n∏

i=1

P (oi|f̃ai , ẽi, f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1, ai−1, ai) (4)

where ⟨f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1⟩ is the previous phrase pair.
Including the previous phrase pairs improves the context sensitivity. For example, given a phrase pair

⟨“yingyun”, “business”⟩, its orientation is more likely to be monotone if it is preceded by a noun phrase
pair such as ⟨“xinyongka”, “credit card”⟩. On the contrary, the probability of the discontinuous orienta-
tion is higher if the previous phrase pairs contain verbs such as ⟨“gaishan”, “improve”⟩. Therefore, the
new model is capable of capturing the phenomenon that the orientation of a phrase pair depends on its
surrounding contexts.

Another advantage of including previous phrase pairs is the reduction of reordering ambiguity. As
shown in Table 1, 92.74% of 1-word Chinese-English phrase pairs have multiple orientations (i.e., M, S,

guage, and collapsing. See http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=FactoredTraining.BuildReorderingModel for more details.

and D) observed in the training data. The ratio decreases with the increase of phrase length. In contrast,
the new model is much less ambiguous (e.g., the ratio of ambiguous one-word phrase pairs dramatically
drops to 21.72%) as it is conditioned on both the current and previous phrase pairs.

Unfortunately, including more contexts in modeling also increases the data sparsity. We observe that
about 90% of reordering examples (i.e., the current and previous phrase pairs) are observed only once in
the training data. As a result, it is more difficult to train lexicalized reordering models accurately using
maximum likelihood estimation.

To alleviate the data sparsity problem, we use the following two strategies:

1. Reordering as classification. Instead of maintaining a reordering probability distribution for each
phrase pair, we build a reordering classifier for all phrase pairs (Xiong et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013).
This significantly reduces data sparsity by considering all occurrences of extracted phrase pairs as
training examples. We find that 500, 000 reordering examples suffice to train a robust classifier
(Section 4.5).

2. Continuous space representation. Instead of using a symbolic representation of phrases, we use
a continuous space representation that treats a phrase as a dense real-valued vector (Socher et al.,
2011b; Li et al., 2013). Consider two phrases “in London” and “in Centara Grand”. It is usually
easy to predict the orientations of “in London” because it might be observed in the training data for
many times. This is not the case for “in Centara Grand” as it might occur only once. However, if
the two phrases happen to have very similar continuous space representations, “in Centara Grand”
is likely to have a similar reordering probability distribution with “in London”.

To generate vector space representation for phrases, we follow Socher et al. (2011a) to use recursive
autoencoders. Given two words w1 and w2, suppose their vector space representations are c1 and c2.
The vector space representation p of the two-word phrase {w1, w2} can be computed using a two-layer
neural network:

p = g(1)(W (1)[c1; c2] + b(1)) (5)

where [c1; c2] ∈ R2n is the concatenation of c1 and c2, W (1) ∈ Rn×2n is a weight matrix, b(1) is a bias
vector, and g(1) is an element-wise activation function.

In order to measure how well p represents c1 and c2, they can be reconstructed using another two-layer
neural network:

[c′1; c
′
2] = g

(2)(W (2)p + b(2)) (6)

where c′1 ∈ Rn and c′2 ∈ Rn are reconstructed vectors of c1 and c2, W (2) ∈ R2n×n is a weight matrix,
b(2) ∈ Rn is a bias vector, and g(2) is an element-wise activation function. The reconstruction error can
be measured by comparing c1 and c2 with c′1 and c′2. This process runs recursively in a bottom-up style
to obtain the vector space representation of a multi-word phrase (Socher et al., 2011a). Socher et al.
(2011a) find that minimizing the norms of hidden layers leads to the reduction of reconstruction error in
an undesirable way. Therefore, we normalize p such that ||p||2 = 1.

Treating phrase reordering as a classification problem, we propose a neural reordering classifier that
takes the current and previous phrase pairs as input. The neural network consists of four recursive
autoencoders and a softmax layer. The input of the classifier are the previous phrase pair and the current
phrase pair. Four recursive autoencoders are used to transform the four phrases (i.e., f̃ai , ẽi, f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1)
into vectors. Then, these vectors are fed to the softmax layer to predict reordering orientations. Note that
the recursive autoencoders for the same language share with the same parameters. Our neural network is
similar to that of Li et al. (2013). The major difference is that Li et al. (2013) need to compute vector
space representation for variable-sized blocks ranging from words to sentences on the fly both in training
and decoding. In contrast, we only need to compute vectors for phrases with up to 7 words in the training
phase, which makes our approach simpler and more scalable to large data.

Formally, given the previous phrase pair ⟨f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1⟩, the current phrase pair ⟨f̃i, ẽi⟩ and the orienta-
tion oi, the reordering probability is computed as

P (oi|f̃ai , ẽi, f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1, ai−1, ai) = g(W oc(f̃ai , ẽi, f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1) + bo), (7)

where W o is a weight matrix, bo is a bias vector, c(f̃ai , ẽi, f̃ai−1 , ẽi−1) is the concatenation of the vectors
of the four phrases. 2

Following Och (2003), we use a linear model in our decoder with conventional features (e.g., trans-
lation probabilities and n-gram language model). The neural reordering model is incorporated into the
discriminative framework as an additional feature.

3.2 Training
Training the neural reordering model involves minimizing the following two kinds of errors:

• Reconstruction error: It measures how well the computed vector space representations represent
the input vectors. It is defined as the average reconstruction error of all the parent nodes in the trees
formed during computing the vector space representation for all the phrases in the training data.

• Classification error: It measures how well the resulting classifier predicts the reordering orienta-
tions. It is defined as the average cross-entropy errors of all the training examples.

In our experiments, the objective function is a linear interpolation of the reconstruction error and the
classification error.

Following Socher et al. (2011b), we use L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to optimize the parameters.
At the beginning of each iteration, a binary tree for each phrase is constructed using a greedy algorithm
(Socher et al., 2011b). 3 With these trees fixed, the partial derivatives with respect to parameters are
computed via the backpropagation through structures algorithm (Goller and Kuchler, 1996).

When optimizing the parameters of the softmax layer, the training procedure keeps the parameters of
the recursive autoencoders and word embedding matrices fixed. The corresponding error function is the
classification error as described above. We also use L-BFGS to optimize the parameters and the standard
error backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986) to compute the derivatives.

3.3 Decoding
As the vector space representation of a phrase is calculated based on all the words in the phrase, using
the neural reordering model complicates the conditions for risk-free hypothesis recombination (Koehn et
al., 2003). Therefore, many hypotheses are not likely to be recombined if the neural reordering model
is directly integrated in decoding, making the decoder to only explore in a much smaller search space.
4 Therefore, we use Moses to generate search graphs and then use hypergraph reranking (Huang and
Chiang, 2007; Huang, 2008) to find most probable derivations using the neural reordering model.

4 Experiments

4.1 Data Preparation
We evaluate our reordering model on Chinese-English translation. The training corpus consists of 1.23M
sentence pairs with 32.1M Chinese words and 35.4M English words. A 4-gram language model was
trained on the Xinhua portion of the English GIGAWORD corpus using KenLM (Heafield, 2011), which
contains 398.6M words. We used the NIST 2006 MT Chinese-English dataset as the development set,
and NIST 2002-2005, 2008 MT Chinese-English datasets as the test sets. Case-insensitive BLEU is used

2In practice, as suggested by Socher et al. (2011b), we feed the four average vectors of the vectors present in each recursive
autoencoders to the softmax layer. Taking “resident population” as an example, there are three vectors in the binary tree used
by the corresponding recursive autoencoder, denoted as x̂1, x̂2 and x̂3. The average vector is computed as x̄ = 13

∑3
i=1 x̂i.

3As phrases in phrase-based translation are not necessarily syntactic constituents, we do not use parse trees in this work.
4Experimental results show that we can only achieve comparable performance with Moses by integrating neural reordering

model directly in decoding.

as the evaluation metric. As a trade-off between expressive power and computational cost, we set the
dimension of the word embedding vectors to 25. 5 Both g(1) and g(2) are set to tanh(·). The other
hyperparameters are optimized via random search (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012).

4.2 Comparison of Distance-based, Lexicalized, and Neural Reordering Models

We compare three kinds of reordering models with increasing expressive power:

1. distance-based model: penalizing phrase displacements proportionally to the amount of nonmono-
tonicity (Koehn et al., 2003);

2. lexicalized models: conditioning the reordering probabilities on the current phrase pairs. The ori-
entations can be determined with respect to words (Tillman, 2004), phrases (Koehn et al., 2007), or
hierarchical phrases (Galley and Manning, 2008);

3. neural model: conditioning the reordering probabilities on both the current and previous phrase
pairs.

For lexicalized and neural models, we further distinguish between two kinds of orientation sets:
{monotone, swap, discontinuous} and {left, right}. The left/right orientations only consider whether
the current source phrase is on the left of the previous source phrase or not. Therefore, swap and
discontinuous-left are merged into left while monotone and discontinuous-right into right.

All these reordering models are tested using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), except that the neural model
needs an additional hypergraph reranking procedure (Section 3.3). Implemented using Java, it takes the
reranker 0.748 second to rerank a hypergraph on average.

Table 2 shows the case-insensitive BLEU-scores of distance-based, lexicalized, and neural reordering
models on the NIST Chinese-English datasets. “distance” denotes the distance-based reordering model
(Koehn et al., 2003), “word” denotes the word-based lexicalized model (Tillman, 2004), “phrase” denotes
the phrase-based lexicalized model (Koehn et al., 2007), “hierarchical” denotes the hierarchical phrase-
based reordering model (Galley and Manning, 2008), and “neural” denotes our model.

5We find that the dimensions of vectors do not have a significant impact on translation performance. For efficiency, we set
the dimension to 25.

Figure 2: The non-separability problem for the neural reordering model. Given an aligned Chinese-
English sentence pair, the unaligned Chinese word “de” makes a big difference in determining M/S/D
orientations. In (a), “de” is included in the previous source phrase and thus the orientation is monotone.
In (b), however, it is not included in the previous source phrase and the orientation is discontinuous. In
our neural reordering model, “liu wan de” and “liu wan” have very similar vector space representations
yet different orientations (i.e., M and D). In other words, training examples labeled with M, S, D are
prone to be mixed with each other in the vector space. Therefore, it is difficult to find a hyperplane to
separate M, S and D examples in the high-dimensional space.

We find that lexicalized reordering models obtain significant improvements over the distance-based
model, which indicates that conditioning reordering probabilities on the words of the current phrase
pairs does improve the expressive power. Our neural model using left/right orientations significantly
outperforms all variants of lexicalized models. We use “*” to highlight the result that is significantly
better than the best baseline (highlighted in italic) at p < 0.05 level and “**” at p < 0.01 level. This
suggests that conditioning reordering probabilities on the words of current and previous phrase pairs is
helpful for resolving reordering ambiguities and reducing context insensitivity.

4.3 The Non-Separability Problem

In Table 2, the neural model using the M/S/D orientations fails to outperform lexicalized models signifi-
cantly. One possible reason is that the neural model suffers from the non-separability problem due to the
M/S/D orientations.

As shown in Figure 2, given an aligned Chinese-English sentence pair, the unaligned Chinese function
word “de” makes a big difference in determining M/S/D orientations. In (a), “de” is included in the
previous source phrase and thus the orientation is monotone. In (b), however, “de” is not included in the
previous source phrase and the orientation is discontinuous. In our neural reordering model, “liu wan
de” and “liu wan” have very similar vector space representations yet different orientations (i.e., M and
D). In other words, training examples labeled with M, S, D are prone to be mixed with each other in
the vector space. Therefore, it is difficult to find a hyperplane to separate M, S and D examples in the
high-dimensional space.

Fortunately, we find that using the left/right orientations can alleviate this problem. As the left/right
orientations only consider whether the current source phrase is on the left of the previous source phrase
or not, unaligned source words will not change orientations. For example, both Figure 2(a) and 2(b) are
identified as the right orientation.

As a result, using left/right orientations in the neural reordering model not only has a higher classifi-
cation accuracy (85%) over using the M/S/D orientations (69%), but also achieves higher BLEU scores
on all NIST datasets systematically.

4.4 The Effect of Distortion Limit

Figure 3 shows the performance of the lexicalized model and our neural model with various distortion
limits. The lexicalized model is the word-based model with M/S/D orientations. The neural model uses
left/right orientations. The neural model consistently outperforms the lexicalized model, especially for
large distortion limits. This finding suggests that the neural model is superior to lexicalized models in
predicting long-distance reordering.

4.5 The Effect of Training Corpus Size

Table 3 shows the classification accuracy and translation performance with various number of randomly
sampled reordering examples for training the neural classifier. The classification accuracy and transla-
tion performance generally rise as the number of reordering example increases.6 Surprisingly, both the
classification accuracy and translation performance of using 500,000 reordering examples are close to
using 3,000,000 reordering examples, suggesting that a relatively small amount of reordering examples
are enough for training a robust classifier.

4.6 Learned Vector Space Representations

We randomly sampled 200,000 English phrases and found 999 clusters according to the vector space
representations computed by recursive autoencoders using the k-means algorithm (MacQueen, 1967).
The distance between two phrases is calculated by the Euclidean distance between their vector space
representations.

Figure 4 shows 10 of the 999 clusters. An interesting finding is that phrase pairs that are close in the
vector space share with similar reordering patterns rather than semantic similarity. For example, “by
june 1” and “within the agencies” have similar distributions on the left/right orientations but are totally
unrelated in terms of meaning. As a result, the vector representations of words trained using unlabeled
data hardly helps in training the neural reordering model. Table 4 shows the results when we replace
the word vectors of our model with those trained using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). The recursive
autoencoders and the classifier are retrained. The performance of the neural reordering model trained in
this way drops significantly, which confirms our analysis.

5 Related Work

Reordering as classification is a common way to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Xiong et al. (2006)
use a maximum entropy model to predict whether to merge two blocks in a straight or an inverted order
in their ITG decoder. Nguyen et al. (2009) build a similar model for hierarchical phrase reordering
models (Galley and Manning, 2008). Green et al. (2010) and Yahyaei and Monz (2010) predict finer-
grained distance bins instead. Another direction is to learn sparse reordering features and create more
flexible distributions (Cherry, 2013). Although these models are effective, feature engineering is a major
challenge. In contrast, our neural reordering model is capable of learning features automatically.

6The reason why the BLEU scores oscillate slightly on the training set is that classification accuracy is not directly correlated
with BLEU scores. Optimizing the neural reordering model directly with respect to BLEU score may further improve the
performance. We leave this for future work.

Along another line, n-gram-based models (Mariǹo et al., 2006; Durrani et al., 2011; Durrani et al.,

al., 2013) or operations (Durrani et al., 2011) directly. Although naturally leveraging both the source and
target side contexts, these approaches still face the data sparsity problem.

Our work is closely related to Li et al. (2013). The major difference is that Li et al. (2013) need to
compute vector space representation for variable-sized blocks ranging from words to sentences on the
fly both in training and decoding. In contrast, we only need to compute vectors for phrases with up to 7
words in the training phase, which makes our approach simpler and more scalable to large data.

6 Conclusion

We have shown that surrounding context is effective for resolving reordering ambiguities in phrase-based
models. As the data sparseness problem is the major challenge for using context in reordering models,
we propose to use a single classifier based on recursive autoencoders to predict reordering orientations.
Experimental results show that our neural reordering model outperforms the state-of-the-art lexicalized
reordering models significantly and consistently across all the NIST datasets under various settings.

There are a few future directions we plan to explore. First, as the machine translation system and neu-
ral classifier are trained separately, the neural network training only has an indirect effect on translation
quality. Jointly training the machine translation system and neural classifier is an interesting topic. Sec-
ond, it is interesting to develop more efficient models to leverage larger contexts to resolve reordering
ambiguities. Third, we plan to extend our work to other translation models such as syntax-based and
n-gram based models (Mariǹo et al., 2006; Durrani et al., 2011; Durrani et al., 2013). Finally, as we cast
phrase reordering as two-category classification problem (i.e, left vs. right), it is interesting to intersect
structured SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) with neural networks to develop a large margin training
algorithm for our neural reordering model.
