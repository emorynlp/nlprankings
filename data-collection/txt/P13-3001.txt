Abstract

Morphologically rich languages such as
Turkish may benefit from morphological
analysis in natural language tasks. In this
study, we examine the effects of morpho-
logical analysis on text categorization task
in Turkish. We use stems and word cate-
gories that are extracted with morphologi-
cal analysis as main features and compare
them with fixed length stemmers in a bag
of words approach with several learning
algorithms. We aim to show the effects
of using varying degrees of morphological
information.

1 Introduction

The goal of text classification is to find the cat-
egory or the topic of a text. Text categorization
has popular applications in daily life such as email
routing, spam detection, language identification,
audience detection or genre detection and has ma-
jor part in information retrieval tasks.

The aim of this study is to explain the impact of
morphological analysis and POS tagging on Turk-
ish text classification task. We train various classi-
fiers such as k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Naive
Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
for this task. Turkish NLP tasks have been proven
to benefit from morphological analysis or segmen-
tation of some sort (Eryiğit et al., 2008; Çetinoǧlu
and Oflazer, 2006; Çakıcı and Baldridge, 2006).
Two different settings are used throughout the pa-
per to represent different degrees of stemming and
involvement of morphological information. The
first one uses the first n-characters (prefixes) of
each word in a bag of words approach. A variety
of number of characters are compared from 4 to 7
to find the optimal length for data representation.
This acts as the baseline for word segmentation
in order to make the limited amount of data less

sparse. The second setting involves word stems
that are extracted with a morphological analysis
followed by disambiguation. The effects of part of
speech tagging are also explored. Disambiguated
morphological data are used along with the part of
speech tags as informative features about the word
category.

Extracting an n-character prefix is simple and
considerably cheap compared to complex state-
of-the-art morphological analysis and disambigua-
tion process. There is a trade-off between quality
and expense. Therefore, we may choose to use a
cheap approximation instead of a more accurate
representation if there is no significant sacrifice in
the success of the system. Turkish is an agglutina-
tive language that mostly uses suffixes1. There-
fore, approximate stems that are extracted with
fixed size stemming rarely contain any affixes.

The training data used in this study consist of
news articles taken from Milliyet Corpus that con-
tains 80293 news articles published in the news-
paper Milliyet (Hakkani-Tür et al., 2000) 2. The
articles we use for training contain a subset of doc-
uments indexed from 1000-5000 and have at least
500 characters. The test set is not included in the
original corpus, but it has also been downloaded
form Milliyet’s public website 3.

The data used in this study have been ana-
lyzed with the morphological analyser described
in Oflazer (1993) and disambiguated with Sak et
al. (2007)’s morphological disambiguator. The
data have been manually labelled for training and
test. The annotated data is made available for pub-

1It has only one prefix for intensifying adjectives and ad-
verbs (sımsıcak: very hot). It is just a modified version of the
first syllable of the original word and also it is not common.
There are other prefixes adopted from foreign languages such
as anormal (abnormal), antisosyal (antisocial) or namert (not
brave).

available, we hope to contribute to future work in
this area.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 briefly describes the classification meth-
ods used, section 3 explains how these methods
are used in implementation and finally the paper is
concluded with experimental results.

2 Background

Supervised and unsupervised methods have been
used for text classification in different languages
(Amasyalı and Diri, 2006; Beil et al., 2002).
Among these are Naive Bayes classification (Mc-
Callum and Nigam, 1998; Schneider, 2005), deci-
sion trees (Johnson et al., 2002) , neural networks
(Ng et al., 1997), k-nearest neighbour classifiers
(Lim, 2004) and support-vector machines (Shana-
han and Roma, 2003).

Bag-of-words model is one of the more intu-
itive ways to represent text files in text classi-
fication. It is simple, it ignores syntax, gram-
mar and the relative positions of the words in
the text (Harris, 1970). Each document is repre-
sented with an unordered list of words and each of
the word frequencies in the collection becomes a
feature representing the document. Bag-of-words
approach is an intuitive way and popular among
document classification tasks (Scott and Matwin,
1998; Joachims, 1997).

Another way of representing documents with
term weights is to use term frequency - inverse
document frequency (Sparck Jones, 1988). TFIDF
is another way of saying that a term is valuable for
a document if it occurs frequently in that docu-
ment but it is not common in the rest of the collec-
tion. TFIDF score of a term t in a document d in a
collection D is calculated as below:

tfidft,d,D = tft,d × idft,D

tft,d is the number of times t occurs in d and idft,D
is the number of documents in D over the number
of document that contain t.

The idea behind bag of words and TFIDF is to
find a mapping from words to numbers which can
also be described as finding a mathematical rep-
resentation for text files. The output is a matrix
representation of the collection. This is also called
vector space model representation of the collec-

4http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/ burakkerim/text cat

tion in which we can define similarity and dis-
tance metrics for documents. One way is to use
dot product since each document is represented as
a vector (Manning et al., 2008). A number of dif-
ferent dimensions in vector spaces are compared
in this study to find the optimal performance.

2.1 Morphology

Languages such as Turkish, Czech and Finnish
have more complex morphology and cause addi-
tional difficulties which requires special handling
on linguistic studies compared to languages such
as English (Sak et al., 2007). Morphemes may
carry semantic or syntactic information, but mor-
phological ambiguity make it hard to pass this in-
formation on to other level in a trivial manner es-
pecially for languages with productive morphol-
ogy such as Turkish. An example of possible mor-
phological analyses of a single word in Turkish is
presented in Table 1.

alın+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom (forehead)
al+AdjˆDB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P2sg+Nom (your red)
al+AdjˆDB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+Pnon+Gen (of red)
al+Verb+Pos+Imp+A2pl ((you) take)
al+VerbˆDB+Verb+Pass+Pos+Imp+A2sg ((you) be taken)
alın+Verb+Pos+Imp+A2sg ((you) be offended)

Table 1: Morphological analysis of the word
”alın” in Turkish with the corresponding mean-
ings.

We aim to examine the effects of morpholog-
ical information in a bag-of-words model in the
context of text classification. A relevant study
explores the prefixing versus morphological anal-
ysis/stemming effect on information retrieval in
Can et al. (2008). Several stemmers for Turkish
are presented for the indexing problem for infor-
mation retrieval. They use Oflazer’s morphologi-
cal analyzer (Oflazer, 1993), however, they do not
use a disambiguator. Instead they choose the most
common analysis among the candidates. Their re-
sults show that among the fixed length stemmers
5-character prefix is the the best and the lemma-
tizer based stemmer is slightly better than the fixed
length stemmer with five characters. However,
they also note that the difference is statistically in-
significant. We use Sak et al. (2007)’s disambigua-
tor which is reported with a 96.45% accuracy in
their study and with a 87.67% accuracy by Eryiğit
(2012)

3 Implementation

In the first setting, up to first N characters of each
word is extracted as the feature set. A compari-
son between 4, 5, 6 and 7 characters is performed
to choose the best N. In the second setting we
use morphological analysis. Each word in docu-
ments is analysed morphologically with morpho-
logical analyser from Oflazer (1993) and word
stems are extracted for each term. Sak’s mor-
phological disambiguator for Turkish is used at
this step to choose the correct analysis (Sak et
al., 2007). Stems are the primary features used
for classification. Finally, we add word categories
from this analysis as features as POS tags.

We compare these settings in order to see how
well morphological analysis with disambiguation
performs against a simple baseline of fixed length
stemming with a bag-of-words approach. Both
stem bags and the first N-character bags are trans-
formed into vector space with TFIDF scoring.
Then, different sizes of feature space dimensions

are used with ranking by the highest term fre-
quency scores. A range of different dimension
sizes from 1200 to 7200 were experimented on to
find the optimal dimension size for this study (Ta-
ble 2). After the collection is mapped into vector
space, several learning algorithms are applied for
classification. K-Nearest neighbours was imple-
mented with weighted voting of 25 nearest neigh-
bours based on distance and Support Vector Ma-
chine is implemented with linear kernel and de-
fault parameters. These methods are used with
Python, NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) and Sci-Kit
(Loper and Bird, 2002; Pedregosa et al., 2011).

Training data contains 872 articles labelled and
divided into four categories as follows: 235 ar-
ticles on politics, 258 articles about social news
such as culture, education or health, 177 arti-
cles on economics and 202 about sports. This
data are generated using bootstrapping. Docu-
ments are hand annotated with an initial classi-
fier that is trained on a smaller set of hand la-
belled data. Classifier is used on unknown sam-

3



ples, then the predictions are manually checked to
gather enough data for each class. Test data con-
sists of 160 articles with 40 in each class. These
are also manually labelled.

4 Experiments

Experiments begin with searching the optimal pre-
fix length for words with different classifiers. Af-
ter that, stems are used as features and evaluated
with the same classifiers. Section 4.3 contains
the comparison of these two features. Finally,
morphological information is added to these fea-
tures and the effects of the extra information is in-
spected in Section 4.4 .

4.1 Optimal Number of Characters

This experiment aims to find out the optimal pre-
fix length for the first N-character feature to rep-
resent text documents in Turkish. We conjecture
that we can simulate stemming by taking a fixed
length prefix of each word. This experiment was
performed with all of the 872 training files and
160 test files. Table 2 shows the results of the ex-
periments where columns represent the number of
characters used and rows represent the number of
features used for classification.

The best performance is acquired using the first
five characters of each word for TFIDF transfor-
mation for all classifiers. Can et al. (2008) also
reported that the five character prefix in the fixed
length stemmer performed the best in their ex-
periments. Learning curves for 5-character pre-
fixes are presented in Figure 1. Although, SVM
performs poorer on average compared to Naive
Bayes, their best performances show no signifi-
cant statistical difference according to McNemar’s
Test. On the other hand, kNN falls behind these
two on most of the configurations.

4.2 Stems

Another experiment was conducted with the word
stems extracted with a morphological analyser and
a disambiguator (Sak et al., 2007). kNN, Naive
Bayes and SVM were trained with different fea-
ture sizes with increasing training data sizes. The
learning curves are presented in Figure 2.

Naive Bayes performs best in this setting even
with a small feature set with few training sam-
ples. When the corpus size is small, using less
features gives better results in SVM and Naive
Bayes. As the number of features used in classi-

fication increases, the number of samples needed
for an adequate classification also increases for
Naive Bayes. The performance of SVM also in-
creases with the number of data used in training.
More documents leave space for repetitions for
stop words and common less informative words an
their TFIDF scores decrease and the get less im-
pact on the classification while informative words
in each category get relatively higher scores, there-
fore an increase in data size also increases perfor-
mance. As the training size increases feature space
dimension becomes irrelevant and the results con-
verge to a similar point for Naive Bayes. On the
other hand, 1200 features are not enough for kNN
and SVM. With larger feature sets kNN and SVM
also give similar results to Naive Bayes although
kNN is left behind especially with less number of
features since it directly relies on the similarity
based on these features in vector space and most of
them are same in each document since we choose
them with term frequency.

4.3 5-Character Prefixes vs Stems

This section provides a comparison between two
main features used in this study with three differ-
ent classifiers. F1 scores for the best and worst
configurations with each of the three classifiers are
presented in Table 3. Using five character prefixes
gives better results than using stems. Naive Bayes
with stems and five character prefixes disagree
only on six instances out of 160 test instances with
F1 scores of 0.92 and 0.94 respectively in the best
configurations. There is no statistically significant
difference.

Similarly, results for SVM with stems for the
best and the worst configurations is considered to
be not statistically significant. McNemar’s Test
(McNemar, 1947) is shown to have low error in
detecting a significant difference when there is
none (Dietterich, 1998).

4.4 SVM with POS Tags

The final experiment examines the effects of POS
tags that are extracted via morphological analy-
sis. Two different features are extracted and com-
pared with the base lines of classifiers with stems
and first five characters without tags. Stem tag is
the first tag of the first derivation and the word
tag is the tag of the last derivation and example
features are given in Table 4. Since derivational
morphemes are also present in the morphological
analyses word tags may differ from stem tags. In
addition, words that are spelled in the same way
may belong to different categories or have dif-
ferent meanings that can be expressed with POS
tags. Al+Verb (take) and Al+Adj (red) are differ-
ent even though their surface forms are the same.

Analysis al+AdjˆDB+Noun+Zero+
A3sg+Pnon+Gen (of red)

First 5 characters. alın ( of red, forehead,
(you) be taken, (you) be of-
fended ...)

Stem al ( red, take )
Stem + Stem Tag al+Adj ( red )
Stem + Word Tag al+Noun ( red )

Table 4: Example features for word ”alın”.

Using POS tags with stems increases the suc-
cess rate especially when the number of features
is low. However, using tags of the stems does
not make significant changes on average. The best
and the worst results differ with baseline with less
than 0.01 points in F1 scores as seen in Figure 3.
This may be due to the fact that the same stem
has a higher chance of being in the same cate-
gory even though the derived final form is differ-
ent. Even though, this may add extra information
to the stems, results show no significant differ-

ence. Adding stem or word tags to the first five
characters increases the success when the number
of training instances are low, however, it has no
significant effect on the highest score. Using tags
with five characters has positive effects when the
number of features are low and negative effects
when the number of features are high.

5 Conclusion

In this study, we use K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive
Bayes and Support Vector Machine classifiers for
examining the effects of morphological informa-
tion on the task of classifying Turkish news arti-
cles. We have compared their performances on
different sizes of training data, different number
of features and different feature sets. Results sug-
gest that the first five characters of each word can
be used for TFIDF transformation to represent text
documents in classification tasks. Another fea-
ture used in the study is word stems. Stems are
extracted with a morphological analyser which is
computationally expensive and takes a lot of time
compared to extracting first characters of a word.
Although different test sets and training data may
change the final results, using a simple approxi-
mation with first five characters to represent doc-
uments instead of results of an expensive morpho-
logical analysis process gives similar or better re-
sults with much less cost. Experiments also indi-
cate that there is more place for growth if more
training data is available as most of the learning
curves presented in the experiments point. We
particularly expect better results with POS tag
experiments with more data. Actual word cate-
gories and meanings may differ and using POS
tags may solve this problem but sparsity of the data
is more prominent at the moment. The future work
includes repeating these experiments with larger
data sets to explore the effects of the data size.
