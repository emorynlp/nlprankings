Abstract

Syntactic structures, by their nature, re-
flect first and foremost the formal con-
structions used for expressing meanings.
This renders them sensitive to formal vari-
ation both within and across languages,
and limits their value to semantic ap-
plications. We present UCCA, a novel
multi-layered framework for semantic rep-
resentation that aims to accommodate the
semantic distinctions expressed through
linguistic utterances. We demonstrate
UCCA’s portability across domains and
languages, and its relative insensitivity
to meaning-preserving syntactic variation.
We also show that UCCA can be ef-
fectively and quickly learned by annota-
tors with no linguistic background, and
describe the compilation of a UCCA-
annotated corpus.

1 Introduction

Syntactic structures are mainly committed to rep-
resenting the formal patterns of a language, and
only indirectly reflect semantic distinctions. For
instance, while virtually all syntactic annotation
schemes are sensitive to the structural difference
between (a) “John took a shower” and (b) “John
showered”, they seldom distinguish between (a)
and the markedly different (c) “John took my
book”. In fact, the annotations of (a) and (c) are
identical under the most widely-used schemes for
English, the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al.,
1993) and CoNLL-style dependencies (Surdeanu
et al., 2008) (see Figure 1).

Underscoring the semantic similarity between
(a) and (b) can assist semantic applications. One
example is machine translation to target languages
that do not express this structural distinction (e.g.,
both (a) and (b) would be translated to the same
German sentence “John duschte”). Question An-
swering applications can also benefit from dis-
tinguishing between (a) and (c), as this knowl-
edge would help them recognize “my book” as a
much more plausible answer than “a shower” to
the question “what did John take?”.

This paper presents a novel approach to gram-
matical representation that annotates semantic dis-
tinctions and aims to abstract away from specific
syntactic constructions. We call our approach Uni-
versal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA).
The word “cognitive” refers to the type of cate-
gories UCCA uses and its theoretical underpin-
nings, and “conceptual” stands in contrast to “syn-
tactic”. The word “universal” refers to UCCA’s
capability to accommodate a highly rich set of se-
mantic distinctions, and its aim to ultimately pro-
vide all the necessary semantic information for
learning grammar. In order to accommodate this
rich set of distinctions, UCCA is built as a multi-
layered structure, which allows for its open-ended
extension. This paper focuses on the foundational
layer of UCCA, a coarse-grained layer that rep-
resents some of the most important relations ex-
pressed through linguistic utterances, including ar-
gument structure of verbs, nouns and adjectives,
and the inter-relations between them (Section 2).

UCCA is supported by extensive typologi-
cal cross-linguistic evidence and accords with
the leading Cognitive Linguistics theories. We
build primarily on Basic Linguistic Theory (BLT)
(Dixon, 2005; 2010a; 2010b; 2012), a typological
approach to grammar successfully used for the de-

228



scription of a wide variety of languages. BLT uses
semantic similarity as its main criterion for cate-
gorizing constructions both within and across lan-
guages. UCCA takes a similar approach, thereby
creating a set of distinctions that is motivated
cross-linguistically. We demonstrate UCCA’s rel-
ative insensitivity to paraphrasing and to cross-
linguistic variation in Section 4.

UCCA is exceptional in (1) being a semantic
scheme that abstracts away from specific syntactic
forms and is not defined relative to a specific do-
main or language, (2) providing a coarse-grained
representation which allows for open-ended ex-
tension, and (3) using cognitively-motivated cat-
egories. An extensive comparison of UCCA to ex-
isting approaches to syntactic and semantic repre-
sentation, focusing on the major resources avail-
able for English, is found in Section 5.

This paper also describes the compilation of a
UCCA-annotated corpus. We provide a quanti-
tative assessment of the annotation quality. Our
results show a quick learning curve and no sub-
stantial difference in the performance of annota-
tors with and without background in linguistics.
This is an advantage of UCCA over its syntactic
counterparts that usually need annotators with ex-
tensive background in linguistics (see Section 3).

We note that UCCA’s approach that advocates
automatic learning of syntax from semantic super-
vision stands in contrast to the traditional view of
generative grammar (Clark and Lappin, 2010).

2 The UCCA Scheme
2.1 The Formalism

UCCA uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to
represent its semantic structures. The atomic
meaning-bearing units are placed at the leaves of
the DAG and are called terminals. In the founda-
tional layer, terminals are words and multi-word
chunks, although this definition can be extended
to include arbitrary morphemes.

The nodes of the graph are called units. A unit
may be either (i) a terminal or (ii) several ele-
ments jointly viewed as a single entity according
to some semantic or cognitive consideration. In
many cases, a non-terminal unit is comprised of a
single relation and the units it applies to (its argu-
ments), although in some cases it may also contain
secondary relations. Hierarchy is formed by using
units as arguments or relations in other units.

Categories are annotated over the graph’s edges,

and represent the descendant unit’s role in forming
the semantics of the parent unit. Therefore, the in-
ternal structure of a unit is represented by its out-
bound edges and their categories, while the roles
a unit plays in the relations it participates in are
represented by its inbound edges.

We note that UCCA’s structures reflect a single
interpretation of the text. Several discretely dif-
ferent interpretations (e.g., high vs. low PP at-
tachments) may therefore yield several different
UCCA annotations.

UCCA is a multi-layered formalism, where
each layer specifies the relations it encodes. The
question of which relations will be annotated
(equivalently, which units will be formed) is de-
termined by the layer in question. For example,
consider “John kicked his ball”, and assume our
current layer encodes the relations expressed by
“kicked” and by “his”. In that case, the unit “his”
has a single argument1 (“ball”), while “kicked”
has two (“John” and “his ball”). Therefore, the
units of the sentence are the terminals (which are
always units), “his ball” and “John kicked his
ball”. The latter two are units by virtue of express-
ing a relation along with its arguments. See Fig-
ure 2(a) for a graph representation of this example.

For a brief comparison of the UCCA formalism
with other dependency annotations see Section 5.

2.2 The UCCA Foundational Layer

The foundational layer is designed to cover the
entire text, so that each word participates in at
least one unit. It focuses on argument structures
of verbal, nominal and adjectival predicates and
the inter-relations between them. Argument struc-
ture phenomena are considered basic by many ap-
proaches to semantic and grammatical representa-
tion, and have a high applicative value, as demon-
strated by their extensive use in NLP.

The foundational layer views the text as a col-
lection of Scenes. A Scene can describe some
movement or action, or a temporally persistent
state. It generally has a temporal and a spatial di-
mension, which can be specific to a particular time
and place, but can also describe a schematized
event which refers to many events by highlight-
ing a common meaning component. For example,
the Scene “John loves bananas” is a schematized
event, which refers to John’s disposition towards
bananas without making any temporal or spatial

1The anaphoric aspects of “his” are not considered part of
the current layer (see Section 2.3).

Abb. Category Short Definition
Scene Elements

P Process The main relation of a Scene that evolves in time (usually an action or movement).
S State The main relation of a Scene that does not evolve in time.
A Participant A participant in a Scene in a broad sense (including locations, abstract entities and Scenes serving

as arguments).
D Adverbial A secondary relation in a Scene (including temporal relations).

Elements of Non-Scene Units
C Center Necessary for the conceptualization of the parent unit.
E Elaborator A non-Scene relation which applies to a single Center.
N Connector A non-Scene relation which applies to two or more Centers, highlighting a common feature.
R Relator All other types of non-Scene relations. Two varieties: (1) Rs that relate a C to some super-ordinate

relation, and (2) Rs that relate two Cs pertaining to different aspects of the parent unit.
Inter-Scene Relations

H Parallel
Scene

A Scene linked to other Scenes by regular linkage (e.g., temporal, logical, purposive).

L Linker A relation between two or more Hs (e.g., “when”, “if”, “in order to”).
G Ground A relation between the speech event and the uttered Scene (e.g., “surprisingly”, “in my opinion”).

specifications. The definition of a Scene is moti-
vated cross-linguistically and is similar to the se-
mantic aspect of the definition of a “clause” in Ba-
sic Linguistic Theory2.

Table 1 provides a concise description of the
categories used by the foundational layer3. We
turn to a brief description of them.
Simple Scenes. Every Scene contains one main
relation, which is the anchor of the Scene, the most
important relation it describes (similar to frame-
evoking lexical units in FrameNet (Baker et al.,
1998)). We distinguish between static Scenes, that
describe a temporally persistent state, and proces-
sual Scenes that describe a temporally evolving
event, usually a movement or an action. The main
relation receives the category State (S) in static and
Process (P) in processual Scenes. We note that
the S-P distinction is introduced here mostly for
practical purposes, and that both categories can be
viewed as sub-categories of the more abstract cat-
egory Main Relation.

A Scene contains one or more Participants (A).
2As UCCA annotates categories on its edges, Scene nodes

bear no special indication. They can be identified by examin-
ing the labels on their outgoing edges (see below).

3Repeated here with minor changes from (Abend and
Rappoport, 2013), which focuses on the categories them-
selves.

This category subsumes concrete and abstract par-
ticipants as well as embedded Scenes (see be-
low). Scenes may also contain secondary rela-
tions, which are marked as Adverbials (D).

The above categories are indifferent to the syn-
tactic category of the Scene-evoking unit, be it a
verb, a noun, an adjective or a preposition. For in-
stance, in the Scene “The book is in the garden”,
“is in” is the S, while “the book” and “the garden”
are As. In “Tomatoes are red”, the main static re-
lation is “are red”, while “Tomatoes” is an A.

The foundational layer designates a separate set
of categories to units that do not evoke a Scene.
Centers (C) are the sub-units of a non-Scene unit
that are necessary for the unit to be conceptualized
and determine its semantic type. There can be one
or more Cs in a non-Scene unit4.

Other sub-units of non-Scene units are catego-
rized into three types. First, units that apply to a
single C are annotated as Elaborators (E). For in-
stance, “big” in “big dogs” is an E, while “dogs” is
a C. We also mark determiners as Es in this coarse-
grained layer5. Second, relations that relate two or

4By allowing several Cs we avoid the difficulties incurred
by the common single head assumption. In some cases the
Cs are inferred from context and can be implicit.

5Several Es that apply to a single C are often placed in

230



more Cs, highlighting a common feature or role
(usually coordination), are called Connectors (N).
See an example in Figure 2(b).

Relators (R) cover all other types of relations
between two or more Cs. Rs appear in two main
varieties. In one, Rs relate a single entity to a
super-ordinate relation. For instance, in “I heard
noise in the kitchen”, “in” relates “the kitchen”
to the Scene it is situated in. In the other, Rs re-
late two units pertaining to different aspects of the
same entity. For instance, in “bottom of the sea”,
“of” relates “bottom” and “the sea”, two units that
refer to different aspects of the same entity.

Some units do not introduce a new relation or
entity into the Scene, and are only part of the for-
mal pattern in which they are situated. Such units
are marked as Functions (F). For example, in the
sentence “it is customary for John to come late”,
the “it” does not refer to any specific entity or re-
lation and is therefore an F.

Two example annotations of simple Scenes are
given in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b).

More complex cases. UCCA allows units to
participate in more than one relation. This is a nat-
ural requirement given the wealth of distinctions
UCCA is designed to accommodate. Already in
the foundational layer of UCCA, the need arises
for multiple parents. For instance, in “John asked
Mary to join him”, “Mary” is a Participant of both
the “asking” and the “joining” Scenes.

In some cases, an entity or relation is prominent
in the interpretation of the Scene, but is not men-
tioned explicitly anywhere in the text. We mark
such entities as Implicit Units. Implicit units are
identical to terminals, except that they do not cor-
respond to a stretch of text. For example, “playing
games is fun” has an implicit A which corresponds
to the people playing the game.

UCCA annotates inter-Scene relations (linkage)
and, following Basic Linguistic Theory, distin-
guishes between three major types of linkage.
First, a Scene can be an A in another Scene. For
instance, in “John said he must leave”, “he must
leave” is an A inside the Scene evoked by “said”.
Second, a Scene may be an E of an entity in an-
other Scene. For instance, in “the film we saw yes-
terday was wonderful”, “film we saw yesterday” is
a Scene that serves as an E of “film”, which is both
an A in the Scene and the Center of an A in the

a flat structure. In general, the coarse-grained foundational
layer does not try to resolve fine scope issues.

A third type of linkage covers all other cases,

e.g., temporal, causal and conditional inter-Scene
relations. The linked Scenes in such cases are
marked as Parallel Scenes (H). The units speci-
fying the relation between Hs are marked as Link-
ers (L)6. As with other relations in UCCA, Linkers
and the Scenes they link are bound by a unit.

Unlike common practice in grammatical anno-
tation, linkage relations in UCCA can cross sen-
tence boundaries, as can relations represented in
other layers (e.g., coreference). UCCA therefore
annotates texts comprised of several paragraphs
and not individual sentences (see Section 3).

Example sentences. Following are complete
annotations of two abbreviated example sentences
from our corpus (see Section 3).
“Golf became a passion for his oldest daughter:
she took daily lessons and became very good,

reaching the Connecticut Golf Championship.”

This sentence contains four Scenes, evoked by
“became a passion”, “took daily lessons”, “be-
came very good” and “reaching”. The individual
Scenes are annotated as follows:

1. “GolfA [becameE aE passionC]P [forR hisE
oldestE daughterC]A”

6It is equally plausible to include Linkers for the other two
linkage types. This is not included in the current layer.

231



2. “sheA [tookF [dailyE lessonsC]C]P ”

3. “sheA ... [becameE [veryE goodC]C]S”

4. “sheA ... reachingP [theE ConnecticutE
GolfE ChampionshipC ]A”

There is only one explicit Linker in this sen-
tence (“and”), which links Scenes (2) and (3).
None of the Scenes is an A or an E in the other, and
they are therefore all marked as Parallel Scenes.
We also note that in the case of the light verb
construction “took lessons” and the copula clauses
“became good” and “became a passion”, the verb
is not the Center of the main relation, but rather
the following noun or adjective. We also note that
the unit “she” is an A in Scenes (2), (3) and (4).

We turn to our second example:
“Cukor encouraged the studio to

accept her demands.”
This sentence contains three Scenes, evoked by

“encouraged”, “accept” and “demands”:

1. CukorA encouragedP [theE studioC]A [toR
[accept her demands]C ]A

2. [the studio]A ... acceptP [her demands]A
3. herA demandsP IMPA
Scenes (2) and (3) act as Participants in Scenes

(1) and (2) respectively. In Scene (2), there is
an implicit Participant which corresponds to what-
ever was demanded. Note that “her demands” is a
Scene, despite being a noun phrase.

2.3 UCCA’s Multi-layered Structure
Additional layers may refine existing relations or
otherwise annotate a complementary set of dis-
tinctions. For instance, a refinement layer can
categorize linkage relations according to their se-
mantic types (e.g., temporal, purposive, causal) or
provide tense distinctions for verbs. Another im-
mediate extension to UCCA’s foundational layer
can be the annotation of coreference relations. Re-
call the example “John kicked his ball”. A coref-
erence layer would annotate a relation between
“John” and “his” by introducing a new node whose
descendants are these two units. The fact that
this node represents a coreference relation would
be represented by a label on the edge connecting
them to the coreference node.

There are three common ways to extend an an-
notation graph. First, by adding a relation that re-
lates previously established units. This is done by
introducing a new node whose descendants are the
related units. Second, by adding an intermediate

for the annotator training. The middle part presents the av-
erage F-scores obtained by the annotators throughout these
passages. The first row presents the average F-score when
comparing the annotations of the different annotators among
themselves. The second row presents the average F-score
when comparing them to a “gold standard”. The bottom row

unit between a parent unit and some of its sub-
units. For instance, consider “he replied foolishly”
and “he foolishly replied”. A layer focusing on
Adverbial scope may refine the flat Scene structure
assigned by the foundational layer, expressing the
scope of “foolishly” over the relation “replied” in
the first case, and over the entire Scene in the sec-
ond. Third, by adding sub-units to a terminal. For
instance, consider “gave up”, an expression which
the foundational layer considers atomic. A layer
that annotates tense can break the expression into
“gave” and “up”, in order to annotate “gave” as the
tense-bearing unit.

Although a more complete discussion of the for-
malism is beyond the scope of this paper, we note
that the formalism is designed to allow different
annotation layers to be defined and annotated in-
dependently of one another, in order to facilitate
UCCA’s construction through a community effort.

3 A UCCA-Annotated Corpus
The annotated text is mostly based on English
Wikipedia articles for celebrities. We have chosen
this genre as it is an inclusive and diverse domain,
which is still accessible to annotators from varied
backgrounds.

For the annotation process, we designed and im-
plemented a web application tailored for UCCA’s
annotation. A sample of the corpus containing
roughly 5K tokens, as well as the annotation ap-
plication can be found in our website7.

UCCA’s annotations are not confined to a sin-
gle sentence. The annotation is therefore carried
out in passages of 300-400 tokens. After its an-

7www.cs.huji.ac.il/˜omria01

232



notation, a passage is manually corrected before
being inserted into the repository.

The section of the corpus annotated thus far
contains 56890 tokens in 148 annotated passages
(average length of 385 tokens). Each passage con-
tains 450 units on average and 42.2 Scenes. Each
Scene contains an average of 2 Participants and 0.3
Adverbials. 15% of the Scenes are static (contain
an S as the main relation) and the rest are dynamic
(containing a P). The average number of tokens in
a Scene (excluding punctuation) is 10.7. 18.3%
of the Scenes are Participants in another Scene,
11.4% are Elaborator Scenes and the remaining
are Parallel Scenes. A passage contains an aver-
age of 11.2 Linkers.

Inter-annotator agreement. We employ 4 an-
notators with varying levels of background in lin-
guistics. Two of the annotators have no back-
ground in linguistics, one took an introductory
course and one holds a Bachelor’s degree in lin-
guistics. The training process of the annotators
lasted 30–40 hours, which includes the time re-
quired for them to get acquainted with the web
application. As this was the first large-scale trial
with the UCCA scheme, some modifications to the
scheme were made during the annotator’s training.
We therefore expect the training process to be even
faster in later distributions.

There is no standard evaluation measure for
comparing two grammatical annotations in the
form of labeled DAGs. We therefore converted
UCCA to constituency trees8 and, following stan-
dard practice, computed the number of brackets in
both trees that match in both span and label. We
derive an F-score from these counts.

Table 2 presents the inter-annotator agreement
in the training phase. The four annotators were
given the same passage in each of these cases. In
addition, a “gold standard” was annotated by the
authors of this paper. The table presents the av-
erage F-score between the annotators, as well as
the average F-score when comparing to the gold
standard. Results show that although it repre-
sents complex hierarchical structures, the UCCA
scheme is learned quickly and effectively.

We also examined the influence of prior linguis-
tic background on the results. In the first passage
there was a substantial advantage to the annotators

one of its incoming edges. This resulted in discarding 1.9%
of the edges. We applied a simple normalization procedure to
the resulting trees.

who had prior training in linguistics. The obtained
F-scores when comparing to a gold standard, or-
dered decreasingly according to the annotator’s
acquaintance with linguistics, were 78%, 74.4%,
69.5% and 67.8%. However, this performance gap
quickly vanished. Indeed, the obtained F-scores,
again compared to a gold standard and averaged
over the next five training passages, were (by the
same order) 78.6%, 77.3%, 79.2% and 78%.

This is an advantage of UCCA over other syn-
tactic annotation schemes that normally require
highly proficient annotators. For instance, both
the PTB and the Prague Dependency Treebank
(Böhmová et al., 2003) employed annotators with
extensive linguistic background. Similar findings
to ours were reported in the PropBank project,
which successfully employed annotators with var-
ious levels of linguistic background. We view
this as a major advantage of semantic annotation
schemes over their syntactic counterparts, espe-
cially given the huge amount of manual labor re-
quired for large syntactic annotation projects.

The UCCA interface allows for multiple non-
contradictory (“conforming”) analyses of a stretch
of text. It assumes that in some cases there is
more than one acceptable option, each highlight-
ing a different aspect of meaning of the analyzed
utterance (see below). This makes the computa-
tion of inter-annotator agreement fairly difficult.
It also suggests that the above evaluation is exces-
sively strict, as it does not take into account such
conforming analyses. To address this issue, we
conducted another experiment where an expert an-
notator corrected the produced annotations. Com-
paring the corrected versions to the originals, we
found that F-scores are typically in the range of
90%–95%. An average taken over a sample of
passages annotated by all four annotators yielded
an F-score of 93.7%.

It is difficult to compare the above results to the
inter-annotator agreement of other projects for two
reasons. First, many existing schemes are based
on other annotation schemes or heavily rely on
automatic tools for providing partial annotations.
Second, some of the most prominent annotation
projects do not provide reliable inter-annotator
agreement scores (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).

A recent work that did report inter-annotator
agreement in terms of bracketing F-score is an an-
notation project of the PTB’s noun phrases with
more elaborate syntactic structure (Vadas and Cur-

233



ran, 2011). They report an agreement of 88.3% in
a scenario where their two annotators worked sep-
arately. Note that this task is much more limited
in scope than UCCA (annotates noun phrases in-
stead of complete passages in UCCA; uses 2 cat-
egories instead of 12 in UCCA). Nevertheless, the
obtained inter-annotator agreement is comparable.
Disagreement examples. Here we discuss two
major types of disagreements that recurred in the
training process. The first is the distinction be-
tween Elaborators and Centers. In most cases this
distinction is straightforward, particularly where
one sub-unit determines the semantic type of the
parent unit, while its siblings add more informa-
tion to it (e.g., “truckE companyC” is a type of a
company and not of a truck). Some structures do
not nicely fall into this pattern. One such case is
with apposition. In the example “the Fox drama
Glory days”, both “the Fox drama” and “Glory
days” are reasonable candidates for being a Cen-
ter, which results in disagreements.

Another case is the distinction between Scenes
and non-Scene relations. Consider the example
“[John’s portrayal of the character] has been de-
scribed as ...”. The sentence obviously contains
two scenes, one in which John portrays a charac-
ter and another where someone describes John’s
doings. Its internal structure is therefore “John’sA
portrayalP [of the character]A”. However, the
syntactic structure of this unit leads annotators at
times into analyzing the subject as a non-Scene re-
lation whose C is “portrayal”.

Static relations tend to be more ambiguous be-
tween a Scene and a non-Scene interpretation.
Consider “Jane Smith (née Ross)”. It is not at all
clear whether “née Ross” should be annotated as a
Scene or not. Even if we do assume it is a Scene,
it is not clear whether the Scene it evokes is her
Scene of birth, which is dynamic, or a static Scene
which can be paraphrased as “originally named
Ross”. This leads to several conforming analyses,
each expressing a somewhat different conceptual-
ization of the Scene. This central notion will be
more elaborately addressed in future work.

We note that all of these disagreements can be
easily resolved by introducing an additional layer
focusing on the construction in question.

4 UCCA’s Benefits to Semantic Tasks

UCCA’s relative insensitivity to syntactic forms
has potential benefits for a wide variety of seman-

tic tasks. This section briefly demonstrates these
benefits through a number of examples.

Recall the example “John took a shower” (Sec-
tion 1). UCCA annotates the sentence as a sin-
gle Scene, with a single Participant and a proces-
sual main relation: “JohnA [tookF [aE showerC]C
]P ”. The paraphrase “John showered” is anno-
tated similarly: “JohnA showeredP ”. The struc-
ture is also preserved under translation to other
languages, such as German (“JohnA duschteP ”,
where “duschte” is a verb), or Portuguese “JohnA
[tomouF banhoC]P ” (literally, John took shower).
In all of these cases, UCCA annotates the example
as a Scene with an A and a P, whose Center is a
word expressing the notion of showering.

Another example is the sentence “John does
not have any money”. The foundational layer
of UCCA annotates negation units as Ds, which
yields the annotation “JohnA [doesF ]S- notD
[haveC]-S [anyE moneyC]A” (where “does ...
have” is a discontiguous unit)9. This sentence can
be paraphrased as “JohnA hasP noD moneyA”.
UCCA reflects the similarity of these two sen-
tences, as it annotates both cases as a single Scene
which has two Participants and a negation. A syn-
tactic scheme would normally annotate “no” in the
second sentence as a modifier of “money”, and
“not” as a negation of “have”.

The value of UCCA’s annotation can again be
seen in translation to languages that have only one
of these forms. For instance, the German transla-
tion of this sentence, “JohnA hatS keinD GeldA”,
is a literal translation of “John has no money”. The
Hebrew translation of this sentence is “eyn le john
kesef” (literally, “there-is-no to John money”).
The main relation here is therefore “eyn” (there-
is-no) which will be annotated as S. This yields
the annotation “eynS [leR JohnC]A kesefA”.

The UCCA annotation in all of these cases is
composed of two Participants and a State. In En-
glish and German, the negative polarity unit is rep-
resented as a D. The negative polarity of the He-
brew “eyn” is represented in a more detailed layer.

As a third example, consider the two sentences
“There are children playing in the park” and “Chil-
dren are playing in the park”. The two sentences
have a similar meaning but substantially different
syntactic structures. The first contains two clauses,
an existential main clause (headed by “there are”)

9The foundational layer places “not” in the Scene level to
avoid resolving fine scope issues (see Section 2)

234



and a subordinate clause (“playing in the park”).
The second contains a simple clause headed by
“playing”. While the parse trees of these sentences
are very different, their UCCA annotation in the
foundational layer differ only in terms of Function
units: “ChildrenA [areF playingC]P [inR theE
parkC]A” and “ThereF areF childrenA [playing]P
[inR theE parkC]A”10.

Aside from machine translation, a great vari-
ety of semantic tasks can benefit from a scheme
that is relatively insensitive to syntactic variation.
Examples include text simplification (e.g., for sec-
ond language teaching) (Siddharthan, 2006), para-
phrase detection (Dolan et al., 2004), summariza-
tion (Knight and Marcu, 2000), and question an-
swering (Wang et al., 2007).

5 Related Work

In this section we compare UCCA to some of the
major approaches to grammatical representation in
NLP. We focus on English, which is the most stud-
ied language and the focus of this paper.

Syntactic annotation schemes come in many
forms, from lexical categories such as POS tags
to intricate hierarchical structures. Some for-
malisms focus particularly on syntactic distinc-
tions, while others model the syntax-semantics in-
terface as well (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1981; Pollard
and Sag, 1994; Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Steed-
man, 2001; Sag, 2010, inter alia). UCCA diverges
from these approaches in aiming to abstract away
from specific syntactic forms and to only represent
semantic distinctions. Put differently, UCCA ad-
vocates an approach that treats syntax as a hidden
layer when learning the mapping between form
and meaning, while existing syntactic approaches
aim to model it manually and explicitly.

UCCA does not build on any other annotation
layers and therefore implicitly assumes that se-
mantic annotation can be learned directly. Recent
work suggests that indeed structured prediction
methods have reached sufficient maturity to allow
direct learning of semantic distinctions. Examples
include Naradowsky et al. (2012) for semantic role
labeling and Kwiatkowski et al. (2010) for seman-
tic parsing to logical forms. While structured pre-
diction for the task of predicting tree structures
is already well established (e.g., (Suzuki et al.,

10The two sentences are somewhat different in terms of
their information structure (Van Valin Jr., 2005), which is rep-
resented in a more detailed UCCA layer.

2009)), recent work has also successfully tackled
the task of predicting semantic structures in the
form of DAGs (Jones et al., 2012).

The most prominent annotation scheme in NLP
for English syntax is the Penn Treebank. Many
syntactic schemes are built or derived from it. An
increasingly popular alternative to the PTB are
dependency structures, which are usually repre-
sented as trees whose nodes are the words of the
sentence (Ivanova et al., 2012). Such represen-
tations are limited due to their inability to natu-
rally represent constructions that have more than
one head, or in which the identity of the head
is not clear. They also face difficulties in repre-
senting units that participate in multiple relations.
UCCA proposes a different formalism that ad-
dresses these problems by introducing a new node
for every relation (cf. (Sangati and Mazza, 2009)).

Several annotated corpora offer a joint syntac-
tic and semantic representation. Examples in-
clude the Groningen Meaning bank (Basile et al.,
2012), Treebank Semantics (Butler and Yoshi-
moto, 2012) and the Lingo Redwoods treebank
(Oepen et al., 2004). UCCA diverges from these
projects in aiming to abstract away from syntac-
tic variation, and is therefore less coupled with a
specific syntactic theory.

A different strand of work addresses the con-
struction of an interlingual representation, often
with a motivation of applying it to machine trans-
lation. Examples include the UNL project (Uchida
and Zhu, 2001), the IAMTC project (Dorr et al.,
2010) and the AMR project (Banarescu et al.,
2012). These projects share with UCCA their
emphasis on cross-linguistically valid annotations,
but diverge from UCCA in three important re-
spects. First, UCCA emphasizes the notion of
a multi-layer structure where the basic layers are
maximally coarse-grained, in contrast to the above
works that use far more elaborate representations.
Second, from a theoretical point of view, UCCA
differs from these works in aiming to represent
conceptual semantics, building on works in Cog-
nitive Linguistics (e.g., (Langacker, 2008)). Third,
unlike interlingua that generally define abstract
representations that may correspond to several dif-
ferent texts, UCCA incorporates the text into its
structure, thereby facilitating learning.

Semantic role labeling (SRL) schemes bear
similarity to the foundational layer, due to their
focus on argument structure. The leading SRL ap-

235



proaches are PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and
NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004) on the one hand,
and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) on the other. At
this point, all these schemes provide a more fine-
grained set of categories than UCCA.

PropBank and NomBank are built on top of the
PTB annotation, and provide for each verb (Prop-
Bank) and noun (NomBank), a delineation of their
arguments and their categorization into semantic
roles. Their structures therefore follow the syn-
tax of English quite closely. UCCA is generally
less tailored to the syntax of English (e.g., see sec-
ondary verbs (Dixon, 2005)).

Furthermore, PropBank and NomBank do not
annotate the internal structure of their arguments.
Indeed, the construction of the commonly used se-
mantic dependencies derived from these schemes
(Surdeanu et al., 2008) required a set of syntactic
head percolation rules to be used. These rules are
somewhat arbitrary (Schwartz et al., 2011), do not
support multiple heads, and often reflect syntac-
tic rather than semantic considerations (e.g., “mil-
lions” is the head of “millions of dollars”, while
“dollars” is the head of “five million dollars”).

Another difference is that PropBank and Nom-
Bank each annotate only a subset of predicates,
while UCCA is more inclusive. This difference
is most apparent in cases where a single complex
predicate contains both nominal and verbal com-
ponents (e.g., “limit access”, “take a shower”). In
addition, neither PropBank nor Nomabnk address
copula clauses, despite their frequency. Finally,
unlike PropBank and NomBank, UCCA’s founda-
tional layer annotates linkage relations.

In order to quantify the similarity between
UCCA and PropBank, we annotated 30 sentences
from the PropBank corpus with their UCCA anno-
tations and converted the outcome to PropBank-
style annotations11. We obtained an unlabeled
F-score of 89.4% when comparing to PropBank,
which indicates that PropBank-style annotations
are generally derivable from UCCA’s. The dis-
agreement between the schemes reflects both an-
notation conventions and principle differences,
some of which were discussed above.

The FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998)

11The experiment was conducted on the first 30 sentences
of section 02. The identity of the predicates was determined
according to the PropBank annotation. We applied a simple
conversion procedure that uses half a dozen rules that are not
conditioned on any lexical item. We used a strict evaluation
that requires an exact match in the argument’s boundaries.

proposes a comprehensive approach to semantic
roles. It defines a lexical database of Frames, each
containing a set of possible frame elements and
their semantic roles. It bears similarity to UCCA
both in its use of Frames, which are a context-
independent abstraction of UCCA’s Scenes, and
in its emphasis on semantic rather than distribu-
tional considerations. However, despite these sim-
ilarities, FrameNet focuses on constructing a lex-
ical resource covering specific cases of interest,
and does not provide a fully annotated corpus of
naturally occurring text. UCCA’s foundational
layer can be seen as a complementary effort to
FrameNet, as it focuses on high-coverage, coarse-
grained annotation, while FrameNet is more fine-
grained at the expense of coverage.

6 Conclusion

This paper presented Universal Conceptual Cog-
nitive Annotation (UCCA), a novel framework
for semantic representation. We described the
foundational layer of UCCA and the compilation
of a UCCA-annotated corpus. We demonstrated
UCCA’s relative insensitivity to paraphrases and
cross-linguistic syntactic variation. We also dis-
cussed UCCA’s accessibility to annotators with no
background in linguistics, which can alleviate the
almost prohibitive annotation costs of large syn-
tactic annotation projects.

UCCA’s representation is guided by conceptual
notions and has its roots in the Cognitive Linguis-
tics tradition and specifically in Cognitive Gram-
mar (Langacker, 2008). These theories represent
the meaning of an utterance according to the men-
tal representations it evokes and not according to
its reference in the world. Future work will ex-
plore options to further reduce manual annotation,
possibly by combining texts with visual inputs
during training.

We are currently attempting to construct a
parser for UCCA and to apply it to several seman-
tic tasks, notably English-French machine trans-
lation. Future work will also discuss UCCA’s
portability across domains. We intend to show
that UCCA, which is less sensitive to the idiosyn-
crasies of a specific domain, can be easily adapted
to highly dynamic domains such as social media.
