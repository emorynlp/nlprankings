Abstract

ROUGE is a widely adopted, automatic
evaluation measure for text summariza-
tion. While it has been shown to corre-
late well with human judgements, it is bi-
ased towards surface lexical similarities.
This makes it unsuitable for the evalua-
tion of abstractive summarization, or sum-
maries with substantial paraphrasing. We
study the effectiveness of word embed-
dings to overcome this disadvantage of
ROUGE. Specifically, instead of measur-
ing lexical overlaps, word embeddings are
used to compute the semantic similarity of
the words used in summaries instead. Our
experimental results show that our pro-
posal is able to achieve better correlations
with human judgements when measured
with the Spearman and Kendall rank co-
efficients.

1 Introduction

Automatic text summarization is a rich field of re-
search. For example, shared task evaluation work-
shops for summarization were held for more than
a decade in the Document Understanding Con-
ference (DUC), and subsequently the Text Anal-
ysis Conference (TAC). An important element of
these shared tasks is the evaluation of participating
systems. Initially, manual evaluation was carried
out, where human judges were tasked to assess
the quality of automatically generated summaries.
However in an effort to make evaluation more
scaleable, the automatic ROUGE1 measure (Lin,
2004b) was introduced in DUC-2004. ROUGE
determines the quality of an automatic summary
through comparing overlapping units such as n-
grams, word sequences, and word pairs with hu-
man written summaries.

1Recall-Oriented Understudy of Gisting Evaluation

ROUGE is not perfect however. Two problems
with ROUGE are that 1) it favors lexical simi-
larities between generated summaries and model
summaries, which makes it unsuitable to evaluate
abstractive summarization, or summaries with a
significant amount of paraphrasing, and 2) it does
not make any provision to cater for the readability
or fluency of the generated summaries.

There has been on-going efforts to improve
on automatic summarization evaluation measures,
such as the Automatically Evaluating Summaries
of Peers (AESOP) task in TAC (Dang and
Owczarzak, 2009; Owczarzak, 2010; Owczarzak
and Dang, 2011). However, ROUGE remains as
one of the most popular metric of choice, as it has
repeatedly been shown to correlate very well with
human judgements (Lin, 2004a; Over and Yen,
2004; Owczarzak and Dang, 2011).

In this work, we describe our efforts to tackle
the first problem of ROUGE that we have iden-
tified above — its bias towards lexical similari-
ties. We propose to do this by making use of word
embeddings (Bengio et al., 2003). Word embed-
dings refer to the mapping of words into a multi-
dimensional vector space. We can construct the
mapping, such that the distance between two word
projections in the vector space corresponds to the
semantic similarity between the two words. By in-
corporating these word embeddings into ROUGE,
we can overcome its bias towards lexical similar-
ities and instead make comparisons based on the
semantics of words sequences. We believe that
this will result in better correlations with human
assessments, and avoid situations where two word
sequences share similar meanings, but get unfairly
penalized by ROUGE due to differences in lexico-
graphic representations.

As an example, consider these two phrases: 1)
It is raining heavily, and 2) It is pouring. If we
are performing a lexical string match, as ROUGE
does, there is nothing in common between the

1925



terms “raining”, “heavily”, and “pouring”. How-
ever, these two phrases mean the same thing. If
one of the phrases was part of a human written
summary, while the other was output by an auto-
matic summarization system, we want to be able
to reward the automatic system accordingly.

In our experiments, we show that word embed-
dings indeed give us better correlations with hu-
man judgements when measured with the Spear-
man and Kendall rank coefficient. This is a signif-
icant and exciting result. Beyond just improving
the evaluation prowess of ROUGE, it has the po-
tential to expand the applicability of ROUGE to
abstractive summmarization as well.

2 Related Work

While ROUGE is widely-used, as we have noted
earlier, there is a significant body of work study-
ing the evaluation of automatic text summarization
systems. A good survey of many of these mea-
sures has been written by Steinberger and Ježek
(2012). We will thus not attempt to go through
every measure here, but rather highlight the more
significant efforts in this area.

Besides ROUGE, Basic Elements (BE) (Hovy
et al., 2005) has also been used in the DUC/TAC
shared task evaluations. It is an automatic method
which evaluates the content completeness of a
generated summary by breaking up sentences into
smaller, more granular units of information (re-
ferred to as “Basic Elements”).

The pyramid method originally proposed by
Passonneau et al. (2005) is another staple in
DUC/TAC. However it is a semi-automated
method, where significant human intervention is
required to identify units of information, called
Summary Content Units (SCUs), and then to
map content within generated summaries to these
SCUs. Recently however, an automated variant of
this method has been proposed (Passonneau et al.,
2013). In this variant, word embeddings are used,
as we are proposing in this paper, to map text con-
tent within generated summaries to SCUs. How-
ever the SCUs still need to be manually identified,
limiting this variant’s scalability and applicability.

Many systems have also been proposed in the
AESOP task in TAC from 2009 to 2011. For ex-
ample, the top system reported in Owczarzak and
Dang (2011), AutoSummENG (Giannakopoulos
and Karkaletsis, 2009), is a graph-based system
which scores summaries based on the similarity

between the graph structures of the generated sum-
maries and model summaries.

3 Methodology

Let us now describe our proposal to integrate word
embeddings into ROUGE in greater detail.

To start off, we will first describe the word em-
beddings that we intend to adopt. A word embed-
ding is really a function W , where W : w → Rn,
and w is a word or word sequence. For our pur-
pose, we want W to map two words w1 and w2
such that their respective projections are closer
to each other if the words are semantically sim-
ilar, and further apart if they are not. Mikolov
et al. (2013b) describe one such variant, called
word2vec, which gives us this desired property2.
We will thus be making use of word2vec.

We will now explain how word embeddings
can be incorporated into ROUGE. There are sev-
eral variants of ROUGE, of which ROUGE-1,
ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 have often been
used. This is because they have been found to cor-
relate well with human judgements (Lin, 2004a;
Over and Yen, 2004; Owczarzak and Dang, 2011).
ROUGE-1 measures the amount of unigram over-
lap between model summaries and automatic sum-
maries, and ROUGE-2 measures the amount of bi-
gram overlap. ROUGE-SU4 measures the amount
of overlap of skip-bigrams, which are pairs of
words in the same order as they appear in a sen-
tence. In each of these variants, overlap is com-
puted by matching the lexical form of the words
within the target pieces of text. Formally, we can
define this as a similarity function fR such that:

fR(w1, w2) =

{
1, if w1 = w2
0, otherwise

(1)

wherew1 andw2 are the words (could be unigrams
or n-grams) being compared.

In our proposal3, which we will refer to as
ROUGE-WE, we define a new similarity function
fWE such that:

fWE(w1, w2) =

{
0, if v1or v2 are OOV
v1 · v2, otherwise

(2)

where w1 and w2 are the words being compared,
and vx = W (wx). OOV here means a situation

2The effectiveness of the learnt mapping is such that we
can now compute analogies such as king − man + woman =
queen.

where we encounter a word w that our word em-
bedding function W returns no vector for. For
the purpose of this work, we make use of a set
of 3 million pre-trained vector mappings4 trained
from part of Google’s news dataset (Mikolov et al.,
2013a) for W .
Reducing OOV terms for n-grams. With our
formulation for fWE , we are able to compute
variants of ROUGE-WE that correspond to those
of ROUGE, including ROUGE-WE-1, ROUGE-
WE-2, and ROUGE-WE-SU4. However, despite
the large number of vector mappings that we have,
there will still be a large number of OOV terms in
the case of ROUGE-WE-2 and ROUGE-WE-SU4,
where the basic units of comparison are bigrams.

To solve this problem, we can compose individ-
ual word embeddings together. We follow the sim-
ple multiplicative approach described by Mitchell
and Lapata (2008), where individual vectors of
constituent tokens are multiplied together to pro-
duce the vector for a n-gram, i.e.,

W (w) = W (w1)× . . .×W (wn) (3)
where w is a n-gram composed of individual word
tokens, i.e., w = w1w2 . . . wn. Multiplication be-
tween two vectors W (wi) = {vi1, . . . , vik} and
W (wj) = {vj1, . . . , vjk} in this case is defined
as:

{vi1 × vj1, . . . , vik × vjk} (4)
4 Experiments

4.1 Dataset and Metrics
For our experiments, we make use of the dataset
used in AESOP (Owczarzak and Dang, 2011), and
the corresponding correlation measures.

For clarity, let us first describe the dataset used
in the main TAC summarization task. The main
summarization dataset consists of 44 topics, each
of which is associated with a set of 10 docu-
ments. There are also four human-curated model
summaries for each of these topics. Each of the
51 participating systems generated a summary for
each of these topics. These automatically gener-
ated summaries, together with the human-curated
model summaries, then form the basis of the
dataset for AESOP.

To assess how effective an automatic evaluation
system is, the system is first tasked to assign a

4https://drive.google.com/file/d/
0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=
sharing

score for each of the summaries generated by all of
the 51 participating systems. Each of these sum-
maries would also have been assessed by human
judges using these three key metrics:
Pyramid. As reviewed in Section 2, this is a semi-
automated measure described in Passonneau et al.
(2005).
Responsiveness. Human judges are tasked to
evaluate how well a summary adheres to the infor-
mation requested, as well as the linguistic quality
of the generated summary.
Readability. Human judges give their judgement
on how fluent and readable a summary is.

The evaluation system’s scores are then tested to
see how well they correlate with the human assess-
ments. The correlation is evaluated with a set of
three metrics, including 1) Pearson correlation (P),
2) Spearman rank coefficient (S), and 3) Kendall
rank coefficient (K).

4.2 Results
We evaluate three different variants of our
proposal, ROUGE-WE-1, ROUGE-WE-2, and
ROUGE-WE-SU4, against their corresponding
variants of ROUGE (i.e., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2,
ROUGE-SU4). It is worth noting here that in AE-
SOP in 2011, ROUGE-SU4 was shown to corre-
late very well with human judgements, especially
for pyramid and responsiveness, and out-performs
most of the participating systems.

Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the correlation of the
scores produced by each variant of ROUGE-WE
with human assessed scores for pyramid, respon-
siveness, and readability respectively. The tables
also show the correlations achieved by ROUGE-1,
ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4. The best result for
each column has been bolded for readability.

ability scores when measured with the Spear-
man and Kendall rank correlation. However,
ROUGE-SU4 correlates better with human assess-
ments for the Pearson correlation. The key differ-
ence between the Pearson correlation and Spear-
man/Kendall rank correlation, is that the former
assumes that the variables being tested are nor-
mally distributed. It also further assumes that the
variables are linearly related to each other. The lat-
ter two measures are however non-parametric and
make no assumptions about the distribution of the
variables being tested. We argue that the assump-
tions made by the Pearson correlation may be too
constraining, given that any two independent eval-
uation systems may not exhibit linearity.

Looking at the two bigram based variants,
ROUGE-WE-2 and ROUGE-WE-SU4, we ob-
serve that ROUGE-WE-2 improves on ROUGE-2
most of the time, regardless of the correlation met-
ric used. This lends further support to our proposal
to use word embeddings with ROUGE.

However ROUGE-WE-SU4 is only better than
ROUGE-SU4 when evaluating readability. It does
consistently worse than ROUGE-SU4 for pyramid
and responsiveness. The reason for this is likely
due to how we have chosen to compose unigram
word vectors into bigram equivalents. The mul-

tiplicative approach that we have taken worked
better for ROUGE-WE-2 which looks at contigu-
ous bigrams. These are easier to interpret seman-
tically than skip-bigrams (the target of ROUGE-
WE-SU4). The latter, by nature of their construc-
tion, loses some of the semantic meaning attached
to each word, and thus may not be as amenable to
the linear composition of word vectors.

Owczarzak and Dang (2011) reports only the
results of the top systems in AESOP in terms of
Pearson’s correlation. To get a more complete
picture of the usefulness of our proposal, it will
be instructive to also compare it against the other
top systems in AESOP, when measured with the
Spearman/Kendall correlations. We show in Ta-
ble 4 the top three systems which correlate best
with the pyramid score when measured with the
Spearman rank coefficient. C S IIITH3 (Ku-
mar et al., 2011) is a graph-based system which
assess summaries based on differences in word
co-locations between generated summaries and
model summaries. BE-HM (baseline by the orga-
nizers of the AESOP task) is the BE system (Hovy
et al., 2005), where basic elements are identi-
fied using a head-modifier criterion on parse re-
sults from Minipar. Lastly, catolicasc1 (de
Oliveira, 2011) is also a graph-based system which
frames the summary evaluation problem as a max-
imum bipartite graph matching problem.

Measure S K
ROUGE-WE-1 0.9138 0.7534

C S IIITH3 0.9033 0.7582
BE-HM 0.9030 0.7456

catolicasc1 0.9017 0.7351

Table 4: Correlation with pyramid scores of
top systems in AESOP 2011, measured with the
Spearman ρ (S), and Kendall τ (K) coefficients.

We see that ROUGE-WE-1 displays better cor-
relations with pyramid scores than the top system
in AESOP 2011 (i.e., C S IIITH3) when mea-
sured with the Spearman coefficient. The latter
does slightly better however for the Kendall coef-
ficient. This observation further validates that our
proposal is an effective enhancement to ROUGE.

5 Conclusion

We proposed an enhancement to the popu-
lar ROUGE metric in this work, ROUGE-WE.

1928



ROUGE is biased towards identifying lexical sim-
ilarity when assessing the quality of a generated
summary. We improve on this by incorporat-
ing the use of word embeddings. This enhance-
ment allows us to go beyond surface lexicographic
matches, and capture instead the semantic similar-
ities between words used in a generated summary
and a human-written model summary. Experi-
menting on the TAC AESOP dataset, we show that
this proposal exhibits very good correlations with
human assessments, measured with the Spear-
man and Kendall rank coefficients. In particular,
ROUGE-WE-1 outperforms leading state-of-the-
art systems consistently.

Looking ahead, we want to continue building
on this work. One area to improve on is the use
of a more inclusive evaluation dataset. The AE-
SOP summaries that we have used in our experi-
ments are drawn from systems participating in the
TAC summarization task, where there is a strong
exhibited bias towards extractive summarizers. It
will be helpful to enlarge this set of summaries to
include output from summarizers which carry out
substantial paraphrasing (Li et al., 2013; Ng et al.,
2014; Liu et al., 2015).

Another immediate goal is to study the use of
better compositional embedding models. The gen-
eralization of unigram word embeddings into bi-
grams (or phrases), is still an open problem (Yin
and Schütze, 2014; Yu et al., 2014). A better com-
positional embedding model than the one that we
adopted in this work should help us improve the
results achieved by bigram variants of ROUGE-
WE, especially ROUGE-WE-SU4. This is im-
portant because earlier works have demonstrated
the value of using skip-bigrams for summarization
evaluation.

An effective and accurate automatic evaluation
measure will be a big boon to our quest for bet-
ter text summarization systems. Word embeddings
add a promising dimension to summarization eval-
uation, and we hope to expand on the work we
have shared to further realize its potential.
