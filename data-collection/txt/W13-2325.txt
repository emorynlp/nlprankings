Abstract

Crowdsourcing, while ideally reducing
both costs and the need for domain ex-
perts, is no all-purpose tool. We review
how paraphrase recognition has benefited
from crowdsourcing in the past and iden-
tify two problems in paraphrase acqui-
sition and semantic similarity evaluation
that can be solved by employing a smart
crowdsourcing strategy. First, we employ
the CrowdFlower platform to conduct an
experiment on sub-sentential paraphrase
acquisition with early exclusion of low-
accuracy crowdworkers. Second, we com-
pare two human intelligence task designs
for evaluating phrase pairs on a semantic
similarity scale. While the first experiment
confirms our strategy successful at tack-
ling the problem of missing gold in para-
phrase generation, the results of the sec-
ond experiment suggest that, for both se-
mantic similarity evaluation on a contin-
uous and a binary scale, querying crowd-
workers for a semantic similarity value on
a multi-grade scale yields better results
than directly asking for a binary classifi-
cation.

1 Introduction

Paraphrase recognition1 means to analyse
whether two texts are paraphrastic, i.e. “a pair
of units of text deemed to be interchangeable”
(Dras, 1999). It has numerous applications in
information retrieval, information extraction,
machine translation and plagiarism detection.
For instance, an internet search provider could
recognize "murder of the 35th U.S. president"
and "assassination of John F. Kennedy" to be

1the terms paraphrase detection and paraphrase identifi-
cation might be used instead

paraphrases of each other and thus yield the same
result. Paraphrase recognition is an open research
problem and, even though having progressed
immensely in recent years (Socher et al., 2011),
state of the art performance is still below the
human reference.
In this research, we analyse how crowdsourcing
can contribute to paraphrase recognition. Crowd-
sourcing is the process of outsourcing a vast
number of small, simple tasks, so called HITs2, to
a distributed group of unskilled workers, so called
crowdworkers3. Reviewing current literature on
the topic, we identify two problems in paraphrase
acquisition and semantic similarity evaluation that
can be solved by employing a smart crowdsourc-
ing strategy. First, we propose how to reduce
paraphrase generation costs by early exclusion of
low-accuracy crowdworkers. Second, we compare
two HIT designs for evaluating phrase pairs on a
continuous semantic similarity scale. In order to
evaluate our crowdsourcing strategies, we conduct
our own experiments via the CROWDFLOWER4

platform.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

Section 2 first gives an overview of related work
and lines out current approaches. We then pro-
ceed to our own experiments on crowdsourcing
paraphrase acquisition (3.3) and semantic similar-
ity evaluation (3.4). Section 4 and 5 conclude the
study and propose future work in the area of para-
phrase recognition and crowdsourcing.

2 Literature Review

Many research fields rely on paraphrase recogni-
tion and contribute to it, as there are many related
concepts. These include inference rule discovery
for question-answering and information retrieval
(Lin and Pantel, 2001), idiom or multiword ex-

pression acquisition (Fellbaum et al., 2006) and
identification (Boukobza and Rappoport, 2009),
machine translation evaluation (Snover et al.,
2009), textual entailment recognition, and many
more.

2.1 Paraphrase Definition
The notion of a paraphrase is closely related to the
concepts of semantic similarity and word ontol-
ogy and an exact definition is not trivial. Often,
complex annotation guidelines and aggregated ex-
pert agreements decide whether phrases are to be
considered paraphrastic or not (Dolan and Brock-
ett, 2005). Formal definitions based e.g. on a do-
main theory and derivable facts (Burrows et al.,
2013) have little practical relevance in paraphrase
recognition. In terms of the semantic similarity
relations ’equals’, ’restates’, ’generalizes’, ’spec-
ifies’ and ’intersects’ (Marsi and Krahmer, 2010),
’paraphrase’ is equated with ’restates’.

It is important to note that in the context of
crowdsourcing, we, as well as most authors, rely
on the crowdworker’s intuition of what a para-
phrase is. Usually, only a limited list of examples
of desired valid paraphrases is given to the crowd-
worker as a reference.

2.2 Paraphrase Recognition
According to Socher et al. (2011), paraphrase
recognition “determines whether two phrases of
arbitrary length and form capture the same mean-
ing”. Paraphrase recognition is mostly under-
stood as a binary classification process, although
recently, some authors proposed a continuous se-
mantic similarity measure (Madnani et al., 2012).

Competing paraphrase recognition approaches
are often compared by their performance on the
Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC).
Until 2011, simple features such as n-gram over-
lap, dependency tree overlap as well as depen-
dency tree edit distance produced the best results
in terms of accuracy and F-measure values. How-
ever, algorithms based solely on such features can
not identify semantic equivalence of synonymous
words or phrases. Therefore, some authors sub-
sequently integrated Wordnet synonyms as well
as other corpus-based semantic similarity mea-
sures. The work of Madnani et al. (2012) based
on the TERP machine translation evaluation met-
ric (Snover et al., 2009) using synonyms and sub-
sentential paraphrases presents the current state of
the art for paraphrase detection on the MSRPC

Figure 1: Highest ranking accuracy and F-
measure over time for paraphrase recognition on
the MSRPC with an inter-rater agreement amongst
human annotators of 84%

with an accuracy of 77.4% and F-measure of
84.1%. The inter-rater agreement amongst human
annotators of 84% on the MSRPC can be consid-
ered as an upper bound for the accuracy that could
be obtained using automatic methods (Fernando
and Stevenson, 2008).

As has become apparent, modern paraphrase
recognition algorithms are evaulated on and incor-
porate semantic similarity measures trained on ac-
quired paraphrases. Therefore, we subsequently
give an overview over established paraphrase ac-
quisition approaches.

2.3 Paraphrase Acquisition

Paraphrase acquisition5 is the process of collecting
or generating phrase-paraphrase pairs, often for a
given set of phrases. All strategies require a sub-
sequent verification of the acquired paraphrases,
either done by experts or trusted crowdworkers.

2.3.1 Sentential Paraphrases
Most literature on paraphrase acquisition deals
with sentential or sentence-level paraphrases.
Bouamor et al. (2012) identify five strategies
such as the translation based methods (Zhou et
al., 2006) using parallel corpora or alignment of
topic-clustered news articles (Dolan and Brockett,
2005).

Via Crowdsourcing In an outstanding ap-
proach, Chen and Dolan (2011) collected para-
phrases by asking crowdworkers to describe short

5also referred to as paraphrase generation

videos. A more cost-effective multi-stage crowd-
sourcing framework was presented by Negri et al.
(2012) with the goal to increase lexical divergence
of the collected paraphrases.

2.3.2 Sub-Sentential Paraphrases
Incorporating sub-sentential paraphrases in ma-
chine translation metrics also used for paraphrase
detection has proven effective (Madnani et al.,
2012). A large corpus consisting of more than
15 million sub-sentential paraphrases was assem-
bled by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) using
a pivot-based paraphrase acquisition method.

Via Crowdsourcing Buzek et al. (2010) ac-
quired paraphrases of sentence parts problematic
for translation systems using AMAZON MECHAN-
ICAL TURK. Bouamor et al. (2012) collected sub-
sentential paraphrases in the context of a web-
based game.

2.3.3 Passage-level paraphrases
Passage-level paraphrase acquisition has been
treated within the context of the evaluation lab
on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social
software misuse (PAN) (Potthast et al., 2010):
Burrows et al. (2013) acquired passage-level
paraphrases for the WEBIS-CPC-11 corpus via
crowdsourcing.

2.4 Semantic Similarity Evaluation

Paraphrase verification can be said to be a man-
ual semantic similarity evaluation done by experts
or trusted crowdworkers, most often on a binary
scale. However, Madnani et al. (2012) believe
that “binary indicators of semantic equivalence
are not ideal and a continuous value [. . . ] in-
dicating the degree to which two pairs are para-
phrastic is more suitable for most approaches”.
They propose averaging a large number of bi-
nary crowdworker judgements or, alternatively, a
smaller number of judgements on an ordinal scale
as in the SEMEVAL-2012 Semantic Textual Simi-
larity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2012). A continu-
ous semantic similarity score is also used to weigh
the influence of sub-sentential paraphrases used by
the TERP metric.

3 Our Experiments

3.1 The CrowdFlower Platform

CROWDFLOWER is a web service for HIT
providers, abstracting from the actual platform on

which these tasks are run. A web interface, incor-
porating a graphical editor as well as the CROWD-
FLOWER MARKUP LANGUAGE6 (CML), can be
used to model these tasks. CROWDFLOWER pro-
vides fine-grained controls over how these tasks
are executed, for instance, by restricting crowd-
workers to live in specific countries or by limiting
the number of HITs a single worker is allowed to
complete.

Furthermore, CROWDFLOWER provides a so-
phisticated system to verify the correctness of the
collected data, aiming at early detection and ex-
clusion of spammers and low-accuracy workers
from the job: gold items. Gold items consist of a
HIT, e.g. a pair of paraphrases together with one or
more possible valid answers. Once gold items are
present in the dataset, workers are prompted to an-
swer these correctly before being eligible to work
on the actual data. Additionally, during the run of
a job, CROWDFLOWER uses hidden gold items to
revise the trustworthiness of a human worker.

3.2 Human Intelligence Task Design

Apart from gold items, the actual HIT design has
the biggest impact on the quality of the collected
data. Correct instructions as well as good exam-
ples have a great influence on data quality. By us-
ing CML validation features, bad user input can be
prevented from being collected in the first place.
Care must also be taken not to introduce an artifi-
cial bias by offering answer choices of different
(time-)complexity. Within our experiments, we
followed common human interface design princi-
ples such as colour coding answer options.

3.3 Crowdsourcing Sub-Sentential
Paraphrase Acquisition

The biggest challenge in paraphrase acquisition
via crowdsourcing is the low and varying accu-
racy of the crowdworkers: “The challenge [. . . ] is
automatic quality assurance; without such means
the crowdsourcing paradigm is not effective, and
without crowdsourcing the creation of test cor-
pora is unacceptably expensive for realistic order
of magnitudes” (Burrows et al., 2013).

We propose a new crowdsourcing strategy that
allows for early detection of low-accuracy work-
ers during the generation stage. This prevents
these unwanted crowdworkers from completing

HITs that would almost certainly not be validated
later on. We focus on the acquisition of sub-
sentential paraphrases for a given set of phrases,
where pivot-based paraphrase acquisition methods
might not be applicable. Transferring our observa-
tions to other types of paraphrases should be un-
problematic.

3.3.1 Phrase-Paraphrase Generation
For this simple baseline strategy, we asked the
crowdworker to generate a short phrase along with
its paraphrase (p1, p2) while providing a small set
of examples.

3.3.2 Two-Staged Paraphrase Generation
This is the traditional crowdsourcing strategy. In
a first generation stage, we presented the crowd-
worker with a phrase p1 and asked for its para-
phrase p2. In a second validation stage, two or
three workers were asked to verify each gener-
ated phrase-paraphrase pair until an unambigu-
ous agreement was reached. As the answers in
the validation stage are binary, gold-items were
added to improve the accuracy of the collected val-
idation judgements. Negri et al. (2012) showed
that after such a validation stage, expert raters
agreed in 92% of the cases with the aggregated
crowdworker judgements. However, the genera-
tion stage is without gold and we cannot exclude
low accuracy workers early enough not to cost
money. We used the regular expression verifier
provided by CROWDFLOWER to ensure that the
generated paraphrases contain at least one word
and are not equal to the given phrases. Other than
this however, the worker could enter any text.

Input Phrases As input data, we required mean-
ingful chunks. For this, any constituent of a sen-
tence can be used. A small number of examples
suggested that verb phrases have a high potential
of yielding interesting paraphrases, as they often
have to be replaced as an isolated unit (“get a flu”
→ “catch a cold”). Therefore, we extracted verb
phrases of two to five words from a source cor-
pus. For this, we used the POS tagger of NLTK7

(A Maxent Treebank POS tagger trained on Penn
Treebank) and a simple chunking grammar parser.

worker might not always be able to come up with a

one chunk at a time, he has to deal with it no mat-
ter how unfeasible it is for paraphrasing. One so-
lution to this problem would be to offer a back-out
option, in which a worker could declare a unit as
unsolvable and possibly explain why. This how-
ever could easily be exploited by human workers,
resulting in many unsolved items. An alternative
solution is to offer workers a choice of the input
phrase they want to paraphrase. We designed a
HIT with a set of three different input phrases of
which they have to pick one to paraphrase. If one
of these options is repeatedly declined by multiple
workers, we can declare it as bad, without having
a worker pass on a unit. However, it turned out that
less than 1% proved unsolvable and we therefore
deemed such measures unnecessary.

3.3.3 Multi-Staged Paraphrase Generation
We improved the traditional two-stage approach
by combining the generation and verification
steps. The task to decide whether a given pair is a
paraphrase is combined with the task of paraphras-
ing a chunk. The matching of verification and
generation items is arbitrary. Figure 2 illustrates
this approach. After an initial generate stage, sub-
sequent stages are combined verify/generate jobs.
The benefit of this approach is that verification of

208



phrase pairs allows the usage of gold-items. We
can now assess the trustworthiness of a crowd-
worker through gold, and we indirectly infer their
ability to paraphrase from their ability to decide if
two items are paraphrases. The aim of this process
is to reduce the number of incorrect paraphrases
being generated in the first place, and thus improve
the efficiency of the CROWDFLOWER task.

In contrast to Negri et al. (2012), we did not re-
strict access to the later stages of this job to high-
accuracy workers of previous stages since our in-
termingled gold-items are expected to filter out
low-accuracy workers in each succeeding stage.
Therefore, we expect to attract contributors from
a bigger pool of possibly cheaper workers.

3.3.4 Evaluation
While only 28% of the collected pairs were val-
idated after the traditional two-staged paraphrase
generation, this percentage increased to 80% in
the second validation stage belonging to the multi-
stage approach. Although the experiment was
conducted on a small number of phrases, this re-
sult is a good indicator that our hypothesis is cor-
rect and that a combined generation and verifi-
cation stage with gold items can reduce costs by
early exclusion of low-accuracy workers.

Lexical divergence measures (TERP) decline,
but this is expected after filtering out pos-
sibly highly divergent non-paraphrastic pairs.
While our generation costs per non-validated sub-
sentential paraphrase were around the same as
those reported by Buzek et al. (2010) (0.024$), the
costs for validated sub-sentential paraphrases were
not much higher (0.06$). Negri et al. (2012) report
costs of 0.27$ per sentential paraphrase, however
these costs are difficult to compare, also because
we did not optimize for lexical divergence.

3.4 Crowdsourcing Semantic Similarity
Evaluation

We conducted an experiment in order to determine
how to optimally query continuous semantic sim-
ilarity scores from crowdworkers. The two dif-
ferent examined methods originally proposed by
Madnani et al. (2012) are binary and senary8 se-
mantic similarity evaluation. Paraphrases were
taken from the MSRPC. Optimality was defined
by two different criteria: First, we analysed how
well the (binary) paraphrase classification by do-
main experts on the MSRPC can be reproduced

8senary: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as opposed to binary {0, 1}.

from our collected judgements. Second, we anal-
ysed how consistent our collected judgements are.
Since we could not find any reference corpus
for semantic similarity evaluation apart from the
SEMEVAL-2012 STS gold that was also acquired
via crowdsourcing, we resorted to training a ma-
chine learning classifier and comparing relative
performance on the collected training data.

3.4.1 Binary Semantic Similarity
Crowdworkers were asked to give a binary clas-
sification of two phrases as either paraphrastic or
non-paraphrastic. Binary decisions were enforced
since no third option was given. Three examples
of valid paraphrases were given.

A minimum of 20 judgements each for 207
phrase pairs were collected for 0.01$ per judge-
ment. In order to deter spammers and the most in-
accurate workers, we converted 14% of the phrase
pairs - those with high expected inter-rater agree-
ment - to gold items. Low inter-rater agreement
on a phrase pair hinted at medium, high inter-rater
agreement hinted at low or high semantic similar-
ity. Trusted crowdworkers had an average gold ac-
curacy of 93% on these gold items.

3.4.2 Senary Semantic Similarity
Crowdworkers were asked to give a senary clas-
sification of two phrases. The six classes were
equivalent to those defined by the SemEval STS
task. A short annotation guide consisting of one
example per category was provided.

A minimum of 8 judgements each for 667
phrase pairs were collected for 0.02$ per judge-
ment. In order to deter spammers and the most in-
accurate workers, we converted 13% of the phrase
pairs to gold items. Gold items were accepted as
long as the judgement lay within an acceptable
range of an expected similarity value.

3.4.3 Input Aggregation and Normalization
The following two phrase pairs demonstrate the
relationship between binary inter-rater agreement
and aggregated senary semantic similarity:

1. „It appears that many employers accused of
workplace discrimination will be considered
guilty until they can prove themselves inno-
cent," he said.

Employers accused of workplace dis-
crimination now are considered guilty until
they can prove themselves innocent.

Sixteen days later, as superheated air
from the shuttle’s re-entry rushed into the
damaged wing, there was no possibility for
crew survival, the board said.’

The binary inter-rater agreement for the first
phrase pair is low (10%), so crowdworkers seem-
ingly could not decide between paraphrastic and
non-paraphrastic. Accordingly, the averaged
senary semantic similarity takes an intermediate
value (3.4).

The binary inter-rater agreement for the sec-
ond phrase pair however is very high (100%), so
we expect the sentences to be either clearly non-
paraphrastic or clearly paraphrastic. A maximal
averaged senary semantic similarity value of 5.0
confirms this intuition.

In order to make aggregated binary and senary
input comparable, we scaled the binary judge-
ments so that the sampled average and variance
matched that of the senary judgements. These
semantic similarities are strongly correlated (3a)
with Pearson coefficient of 0.81 and seem to re-
spect the MSRPC expert annotator rating with
positive correlation between aggregated semantic
similarity and binary MSRPC classification.

With reference to Denkowski and Lavie (2010),
we used the following aggregation and normaliza-
tion techniques:

Straight Average The aggregated semantic sim-
ilarity is the average of all collected judge-
ments. This is our baseline approach.

Judge Normalization To compensate for differ-
ent evaluation standards, each judge’s judge-
ments are scaled so that its sample average
and variance matches that of the average (3b).

Judge Outlier Removal Removing judges
whose inter-rater agreement with the average
is less than 0.5; motivated by Agirre et
al. (2012): “Given the high quality of the
annotations among the turkers, we could
alternatively use the correlation between
the turkers itself to detect poor quality
annotators”.

Weighted Voting Each judge’s judgements are
weighted by its inter-rater agreement with the
average.

We also wanted to know whether limiting the
amount of possible HITs or judgements per
crowdworker could increase the quality of the
collected judgements. However, while high-
throughput crowdworkers showed lower variance
in their agreement compared to crowdworkers
with a small number of completed HITs, correla-
tion between the number of completed HITs and
agreement was very weak (3c) with Pearson coef-
ficient of 0.01.

3.4.4 Machine Learning Evaluation
We trained the UKP machine learning classi-
fier originally developed for the Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) task at SemEval-2012 (Bär et al.,
2012) on the averaged binary and senary judge-
ments for 207 identical phrase pairs. Since we
were not interested in the performance of the ma-
chine learning classifier but in the quality of the
collected data, we measured the relative perfor-
mance of the learned model on the training data.
The number of training examples remained con-
stant. This was repeated multiple times while
varying the number of judgements used in the ag-
gregation of the semantic similarity values. We
observed that with increasing number of judge-
ments, the correlation coefficient converges seem-
ingly against an upper bound (binary: 0.68 for 20
judgements, senary: 0.741 for 8 judgements). The

trained on semantic similarity data collected on a

three senary judgements per phrase pair into ac-
count, it is still superior to 20 binary judgements
although the total amount of information queried
from the crowdworkers is much smaller.

In a second step, we compared the perfor-
mance while employing different input normaliza-
tion techniques on the whole set of 667 phrase
pairs with senary judgements. While all tech-
niques increased the trained classifier’s perfor-
mance, weighted voting performed best (2).

3.4.5 MSRPC Evaluation
In addition to the machine learning evaluation, we
compared our results to the binary semantic simi-
larity classification given by the MSRPC expert
annotators. In order to do so, we had to find
an optimal threshold in [0, 5] splitting our seman-
tic similarity range in two, dividing paraphras-

tic from non-paraphrastic phrase pairs. Again,
this was repeated multiple times while varying
the number of judgements used in the aggrega-
tion of the semantic similarity values. However,
this time we did not simply take the first n judge-
ments each, but averaged over different possible
sampling combinations. We measured percentage
agreement with MSRPC and the optimal thresh-
old for non-weighted and weighted judgements,
since weighted voting performed best in the ma-
chine learning evaluation (5c).

Surprisingly, even for binary paraphrastic-non-
paraphrastic classification, querying a senary se-
mantic similarity value from crowdworkers yields
better results than directly asking for a binary clas-
sification. However, the results also indicate that
in both cases, input normalization plays an im-
portant role and agreement could be improved by
more sophisticated or combined input normaliza-
tion techniques as well as by collecting additional
judgements.

A semantic similarity of 3.1 (senary) (5a) re-
spectively 3.5 (binary) (5b) corresponds opti-
mally to the paraphrastic-non-paraphrastic thresh-
old chosen by the MSRPC expert annotators.

4 Conclusion

We presented a multi-stage crowdsourcing ap-
proach tackling the problem of missing gold in
paraphrase generation. This approach has shown
to work very well for sub-sentential paraphrase
generation and we strongly believe that it will
work equally well for sentential paraphrase gen-
eration, resulting in significantly reduced costs of
paraphrase corpus creation.

We also compared different crowdsourcing ap-
proaches towards semantic similarity evaluation,
showing that for both semantic similarity evalua-
tion on a continuous and a binary scale, querying
an ordinal senary semantic similarity value from
crowdworkers yields better results than directly
asking for a binary classification.

5 Future Work

Our goal to sub-sentential paraphrase generation
was cost minimization by early removal of low-
accuracy workers. Apart from being grammatical
and paraphrastic, we did not enforce other qual-
ity constraints on the collected data. A combina-
tion of our multi-stage approach with that of Ne-
gri et al. (2012) could prove successful if both
cost and quality, i.e. lexical divergence between
phrase-paraphrase pairs, are to be optimized.

There is also room for reducing the cost of
the verification stage e.g. by automatically filter-

ing out paraphrases before presenting them to a
crowdworker using e.g. lexical divergence, length
of the sentence or other measures as it was done
by Burrows et al. (2013).

Another interesting question we could not an-
swer due to budget constraints is: Can the crowd
replace the expert and if yes, how many crowd-
workers are needed to do so reliably? One pos-
sible way to answer this question for paraphrase
evaluation would be to collect semantic similarity
judgements for the whole MSRPC and to see how
many judgements per phrase are needed to reliably
reproduce the MSRPC classification results with
an inter-rater agreement of 84% for the whole cor-
pus.
