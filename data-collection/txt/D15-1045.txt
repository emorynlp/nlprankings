Abstract

We propose a summarization approach for
scientific articles which takes advantage
of citation-context and the document
discourse model. While citations have
been previously used in generating
scientific summaries, they lack the related
context from the referenced article and
therefore do not accurately reflect the
article’s content. Our method overcomes
the problem of inconsistency between
the citation summary and the article’s
content by providing context for each
citation. We also leverage the inherent
scientific article’s discourse for producing
better summaries. We show that our
proposed method effectively improves
over existing summarization approaches
(greater than 30% improvement over the
best performing baseline) in terms of
ROUGE scores on TAC2014 scientific
summarization dataset. While the dataset
we use for evaluation is in the biomedical
domain, most of our approaches are
general and therefore adaptable to other
domains.

1 Introduction

Due to the expanding rate at which articles
are being published in each scientific field, it
has become difficult for researchers to keep up
with the developments in their respective fields.
Scientific summarization aims to facilitate this
problem by providing readers with concise and
informative representation of contributions or
findings of an article. Scientific summarization
is different than general summarization in three
main aspects (Teufel and Moens, 2002). First, the
length of scientific papers are usually much longer
than general articles (e.g newswire). Second,

in scientific summarization, the goal is typically
to provide a technical summary of the paper
which includes important findings, contributions
or impacts of a paper to the community. Finally,
scientific papers follow a natural discourse. A
common organization for scientific paper is the
one in which the problem is first introduced and
is followed by the description of hypotheses,
methods, experiments, findings and finally results
and implications. Scientific summarization
was recently further motivated by TAC2014
biomedical summarization track1 in which they
planned to investigate this problem in the domain
of biomedical science.

There are currently two types of approaches
towards scientific summarization. First is the
articles’ abstracts. While abstracts provide a
general overview of the paper, they cannot be
considered as an accurate scientific summary by
themselves. That is due to the fact that not all
the contributions and impacts of the paper are
included in the abstract (Elkiss et al., 2008). In
addition, the stated contributions are those that the
authors deem important while they might be less
important to the scientific community. Moreover,
contributions are stated in a general and less
focused fashion. These problems motivated the
other form of scientific summaries, i.e., citation
based summaries. Citation based summary is a
summary which is formed by utilizing a set of
citations to a referenced article (Qazvinian and
Radev, 2008; Qazvinian et al., 2013). This
set of citations has been previously indicated as
a good representation of important findings and
contributions of the article. Contributions stated
in the citations are usually more focused than the
abstract and contain additional information that is
not in the abstract (Elkiss et al., 2008).

However, citations may not accurately represent

the content of the referenced article as they are
biased towards the viewpoint of the citing authors.
Moreover, citations may address a contribution or
a finding regarding the referenced article without
referring to the assumptions and data under which
it was obtained.

The problem of inconsistency between the
degree of certainty of expressing findings between
the citing article and referenced article has
been also reported (De Waard and Maat, 2012).
Therefore, citations by themselves lack the related
“context” from the original article. We call the
textual spans in the reference articles that reflect
the citation, the citation-context. Figure 1 shows
an example of the citation-context in the reference
article (green color) for a citation in the citing
article (blue color).

We propose an approach to overcome the
aforementioned shortcomings of existing
scientific summaries. Specifically, we extract
citation-context in the reference article for each
citation. Then, by using the discourse facets of
the citations as well as community structure of the
citation-contexts, we extract candidate sentences
for the summary. The final summary is formed by
maximizing both novelty and informativeness of
the sentences in the summary. We evaluate and
compare our methods against several well-known
summarization methods. Evaluation results on the
TAC2014 dataset show that our proposed methods
can effectively improve over the well-known
existing summarization approaches. That is, we
obtained greater than 30% improvement over the
highest performing baseline in terms of mean
ROUGE scores.

Document summarization is a relatively well
studied area and various types of approaches for
document summarization have been proposed in
the past twenty years.

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has been
used in text summarization first by (Gong
and Liu, 2001). Other variations of LSA
based summarization approaches have later
been introduced (Steinberger and Jezek, 2004;
Steinberger et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009; Ozsoy
et al., 2010). Summarization approaches based
on topic modeling and Bayesian models have
also been explored (Vanderwende et al., 2007;
Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz

Citing article:

... The general impression that has emerged is that transformation
of human cells by Ras requires the inactivation of both the pRb and p53
pathways, typically achieved by introducing DNA tumor virus oncoproteins
such as SV40 large tumor antigen (T-Ag) or human papillomavirus E6 and
E7 proteins ( Serrano et al., 1997 ).
To address this question, we have been investigating the ...

transformation (e.g., refractile morphology, loss of contact inhibition), which
were apparent almost immediately after H-ras V12 was transduced (data not
shown). These results indicate that p53 and p16 are essential for ras-induced
arrest in MEFs, and that inactivation of either p53 or p16 alone is sufficient
to circumvent arrest. In REF52 and IMR90 fibroblasts, a different approach
was ...

and Hakkani-Tur, 2010; Ritter et al., 2010;
Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tür, 2011; Ma and
Nakagawa, 2013; Li and Li, 2014). In these
approaches, the content/topic distribution in the
final summary is estimated using a graphical
probabilistic model. Some approaches have
viewed summarization as an optimization task
solved by linear programming (Clarke and
Lapata, 2008; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;
Woodsend and Lapata, 2012). Many works
have viewed the summarization problem as a
supervised classification problem in which several
features are used to predict the inclusion of
document sentences in the summary. Variations
of supervised models have been utilized for
summary generation, such as: maximum entropy
(Osborne, 2002), HMM (Conroy et al., 2011),
CRF (Galley, 2006; Shen et al., 2007; Chali and
Hasan, 2012), SVM (Xie and Liu, 2010), logistic
regression (Louis et al., 2010) and reinforcement
learning (Rioux et al., 2014). Problems with
supervised models in context of summarization
include the need for large amount of annotated
data and domain dependency.

Graph based models have shown promising
results for text summarization. In these
approaches, the goal is to find the most central
sentences in the document by constructing a
graph in which nodes are sentences and edges
are similarity between these sentences. Examples
of these techniques include LexRank (Erkan
and Radev, 2004), TextRank (Mihalcea and
Tarau, 2004), and the work by (Paul et al.,
2010). Maximizing the novelty and preventing

391



the redundancy in a summary is addressed
by greedy selection of content summarization
(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Guo and Sanner,
2010; Lin et al., 2010). Rhetorical structure
of the documents have also been investigated
for automatic summarization. In this line of
work, dependency and discourse parsing based
on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann
and Thompson, 1988) is used for analyzing the
structure of the documents (Hirao et al., 2013;
Kikuchi et al., 2014; Yoshida et al., 2014).
Summarization based on rhetorical structure is
better suited for shorter documents and is highly
dependent on the quality of the discourse parser
that is used. Training the discourse parser
requires large amount of training data in the RST
framework.

Scientific article summarization was first
studied by (Teufel and Moens, 2002) in which
they trained a supervised Naive Bayes classifier
to select informative content for the summary.
Later (Elkiss et al., 2008) argue the benefits of
citations to scientific work analysis. (Cohan et
al., 2015) use a search oriented approach for
finding relevant parts of the reference paper to
citations. (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Qazvinian
et al., 2013) use citations to an article to construct
its summary. More specifically, they perform
hierarchical agglomerative clustering on citations
to maximize purity and select most central
sentences from each cluster for the final summary.
Our work is closest to (Qazvinian and Radev,
2008) with the difference that they only make
use of citations. While citations are useful for
summarization, relying solely on them might
not accurately capture the original context of
the referenced paper. That is, the generated
summary lacks the appropriate evidence to
reflect the content of the original paper, such as
circumstances, data and assumptions under which
certain findings were obtained. We address this
shortcoming by leveraging the citation-context
and the inherent discourse model in the scientific
articles.

3 The summarization approach

Our scientific summary generation algorithm is
composed of four steps: (1) Extracting the
citation-context, (2) Grouping citation-contexts,
(3) Ranking the sentences within each group and
(4) Selecting the sentences for final summary. We

assume that the citation text (the text span in
the citing article that references another article)
in each citing article is already known. We
describe each step in the following sub-sections.
Our proposed method generates a summary of
an article with the premise that the article has
a number of citations to it. We call the article
that is being referenced the “reference article”.
We shall note that we tokenized the articles’ text
to sentences by using the punkt unsupervised
sentence boundary detection algorithm (Kiss and
Strunk, 2006). We modified the original sentence
boundary detection algorithm to also account for
biomedical abbreviations. For the rest of the
paper, “sentence” refers to units that are output
of the sentence boundary detection algorithm,
whereas “text span” or in short “span” can consist
of multiple sentences.

3.1 Extracting the citation-context
As described in section 2, one problem with
existing citation based summarization approaches
is that they lack the context of the referenced
paper. Therefore, our goal is to leverage citation-
context in the reference article to correctly reflect
the reference paper. To find citation-contexts, we
consider each citation as an n-gram vector and use
vector space model for locating the relevant text
spans in the reference article. More specifically,
given a citation c, we return the ranked list of
text spans r1, r2, ..., rn which have the highest
similarity to c. We call the retrieved text spans
reference spans. These reference spans are
essentially forming the context for each citation.
The similarity function is the cosine similarity
between the pivoted normalized vectors. We
evaluated four different approaches for forming
the citation vector.

1. All terms in citation except for stopwords,
numeric values and citation markers i.e., name
of authors or numbered citations. In figure 1 an
example of citation marker is shown.

2. Terms with high inverted document frequency
(idf). Idf values of terms have shown to be a good
estimate of term informativeness.

3. Concepts that are represented through noun
phrases in the citation, for example in the
following: “ ... typically achieved by introducing
DNA tumor virus oncoproteins such a ... ” which
is part of a citation, the phrase “DNA tumor virus
oncoproteins” is a noun phrase.

392



4. Biomedical concepts and noun phrases
expanded by related biomedical concepts: This
formation is specific to the biomedical domain.
It selects biomedical concepts and noun phrases
in the citation and uses related biomedical
terminology to expand the citation vector.
We used Metamap1 for extracting biomedical
concepts from the citation text (which is a tool
for mapping free form text to UMLS2 concepts).
For expanding the citation vector using the related
biomedical terminology, we used SNOMED CT3

ontology by which we added synonyms of the
concepts in the citation text to the citation vector.

3.2 Grouping the citation-contexts
After identifying the context for each citation, we
use them to form the summary. To capture various
important aspects of the reference article, we form
groups of citation-contexts that are about the same
topic. We use the following two approaches for
forming these groups:

Community detection - We want to find diverse
key aspects of the reference article. We form
the graph of extracted reference spans in which
nodes are sentences and edges are similarity
between sentences. As for the similarity function,
we use cosine similarity between tf-idf vectors
of the sentences. Similar to (Qazvinian and
Radev, 2008), we want to find subgraphs or
communities whose intra-connectivity is high but
inter-connectivity is low. Such quality is captured
by the modularity measure of the graph (Newman,
2006; Newman, 2012). Graph modularity
quantifies the denseness of the subgraphs in
comparison with denseness of the graph of
randomly distributed edges and is defined as
follows:

Q =
1

2m

∑
vw

[
Avw − kv × kw2m

]
δ(cv, cw)

Where Avw is the weigh of the edge (v, w); kv is
the degree of the vertex v; cv is the community of
vertex v; δ is the Kronecker’s delta function and
m =

∑
vw Avw is the normalization factor.

While the general problem of precise partitioning
of the graph into highly dense communities

1http://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/

controlled vocabularies in the biomedical sciences, http://

snomed main.html

that optimizes the modularity is computationally
prohibitive (Brandes et al., 2008), many heuristic
algorithms have been proposed with reasonable
results. To extract communities from the graph
of reference spans, we use the algorithm proposed
by (Blondel et al., 2008) which is a simple
yet accurate and efficient community detection
algorithm. Specifically, communities are built in
a hierarchical fashion. At first, each node belongs
to a separate community. Then nodes are assigned
to new communities if there is a positive gain
in modularity. This process is applied iteratively
until no further improvement in modularity is
possible.

Discourse model - A natural discourse model is
followed in each scientific article. In this method,
instead of finding communities to capture different
important aspects of the paper, we try to select
reference spans based on the discourse model of
the paper. The discourse model is according
to the following facets: “hypothesis”, “method”,
“results”, “implication”, “discussion” and “data-
set-used”. The goal is to ideally include reference
spans from each of these discourse facets of the
article in the summary to correctly capture all
aspects of the article. We use a one-vs-rest SVM
supervised model with linear kernel to classify
the reference spans to their respective discourse
facets. Training was done on both the citation
and reference spans since empirical evaluation
showed marginal improvements upon including
the reference spans in addition to the citation
itself. We use unigram and verb features with tf-
idf weighting to train the classifier.

3.3 Ranking model

To identify the most representative sentences of
each group, we require a measure of importance
of sentences. We consider the sentences in a
group as a graph and rank nodes based on their
importance. An important node is a node that
has many connections with other nodes. There
are various ways of measuring centrality of nodes
such as nodes degree, betweenness, closeness and
eigenvectors. Here, we opt for eigenvectors and
we find the most central sentences in each group
by using the “power method” (Erkan and Radev,
2004) which iteratively updates the eigenvector
until convergence.

393



3.4 Selecting the sentences for final summary
After scoring and ranking the sentences in each
group which were identified either by discourse
model or by community detection algorithm, we
employ two strategies for generating the summary
within the summary length threshold.
• Iterative: We select top sentences iteratively from

each group until we reach the summary length
threshold. That is, we first pick the top sentence
from all groups and if the threshold is not met,
we select the second sentence and so forth. In the
discourse based method, the following ordering
for selecting sentences from groups is used:
“hypothesis”, “method”,“results”, “implication”
and “discussion”. In the community detection
method, no pre-determined order is specified.
• Novelty: We employ a greedy strategy similar to

MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) in which
sentences from each group are selected based on
the following scoring formula:

score(S) def=λSim1(S, D)
− (1− λ)Sim2(S,Summary)

Where, for each sentence S, the score is a
linear interpolation of similarity of sentence with
all other sentences (Sim1) and the similarity
of sentence with the sentences already in the
summary (Sim2) and λ is a constant. We
empirically set λ = 0.7 and also selected
top 3 central sentences from each group as the
candidates for the final summary.

4 Experimental setup

4.1 Data
We used the TAC2014 biomedical summarization
dataset for evaluation of our proposed method.
The TAC2014 benchmark contains 20 topics
each of which consists of one reference article
and several articles that have citations to each
reference article (the statistics of the dataset is
shown in Table 1). All articles are biomedical
papers published by Elsevier. For each topic,
4 experts in biomedical domain have written a
scientific summary of length not exceeding 250
words for the reference article. The data also
contains annotated citation texts as well as the
discourse facets. The latter were used to build the
supervised discourse model. The distribution of
discourse facets is shown in Table 2.

4.2 Baselines
We compared existing well-known and widely-
used approaches discussed in section 2 with
our approach and evaluated their effectiveness
for scientific summarization. The first three
approaches use the scientific article’s text and the
last approach uses the citations to the article for
generating the summary.
• LSA (Steinberger and Jezek, 2004) - The LSA

summarization method is based on singular value
decomposition. In this method, a term document
index A is created in which the values correspond
to the tf-idf values of terms in the document.
Then, Singular Value Decomposition, a dimension
reduction approach, is applied to A. This will
yield a singular value matrix Σ and a singular
vector matrix VT . The top singular vectors are
selected from VT iteratively until length of the
summary reaches a predefined threshold.
• LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) - LexRank

uses a measure called centrality to find the most
representative sentences in given sets of sentences.
It finds the most central sentences by updating the
score of each sentence using an algorithm based
on PageRank random walk ranking model (Page et
al., 1999). More specifically, the centrality score
of each sentence is represented by a centrality
matrix p which is updated iteratively through the
following equation using a method called “power
method”:

p = AT p

Where matrix A is based on the similarity matrix
B of the sentences:

A = [dU + (1− d)B]

394



In which U is a square matrix with values 1/N and
d is a parameter called the damping factor. We set
d to 0.1 which is the default suggested value.
• MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) - In

Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), sentences
are greedily ranked according to a score based on
their relevance to the document and the amount
of redundant information they carry. It scores
sentences based on the maximization of the linear
interpolation of the relevance to the document and
diversity:

MMR(S,D) def=λSim1(S, D)
− (1− λ)Sim2(S,Summary)

Where S is the sentence being evaluated, D is
the document being summarized, Sim1 and Sim2
are similarity function, Summary is the summary
formed by the previously selected sentences and
λ is a parameter. We used cosine similarity as
similarity functions and we set λ to 0.3, 0.5 and
0.7 for observing the effect of informativeness vs.
novelty.
• Citation summary (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008)-

In this approach, a network of citations is built
and citations are clustered to maximum purity
(Zhao and Karypis, 2001) and mutual information.
These clusters are then used to generate the final
summary by selecting the top central sentences
from each cluster in a round-robin fashion. Our
approach is similar to this work in that they also
use centrality scores on citation network clusters.
Since they only focus on citations, comparison of
our approach with this work gives a better insight
into how beneficial our use of citation-context
and article’s discourse model can be in generating
scientific summaries.

5 Results and discussions

5.1 Evaluation metrics
We use the ROUGE evaluation metrics which
has shown consistent correlation with manually
evaluated summarization scores (Lin, 2004). More
specifically, we use ROUGE-L, ROUGE-1 and
ROUGE-2 to evaluate and compare the quality of
the summaries generated by our system. While
ROUGE-N focuses on n-gram overlaps, ROUGE-L
uses the longest common subsequence to measure
the quality of the summary. ROUGE-N where N

is the n-gram order, is defined as follows:

ROUGE-N =

∑
S∈{Gold summaries}

∑
W∈S

fmatch(W )∑
S∈{Gold summaries}

∑
W∈S

f(W )

WhereW is the n-gram, f(.) is the count function,
fmatch(.) is the maximum number of n-grams co-
occurring in the generated summary and in a set of
gold summaries. For a candidate summary C with
n words and a gold summary S with u sentences,
ROUGE-L is defined as follows:

ROUGE-Lrec =

u∑
i=1

LCS∪(ri, C)∑u
i=1 |ri|

ROUGE-Lprec =

u∑
i=1

LCS∪(ri, C)

n

Where LCS∪(., .) is the Longest common
subsequence (LCS) score of the union of LCS
between gold sentence ri and the candidate
summary C. ROUGE-L f score is the harmonic
mean between precision and recall.

5.2 Comparison between summarizers
We generated two sets of summaries using the
methods and baselines described in previous
sections. We consider short summaries of
length 100 words and longer summaries of
length 250 words (which corresponds to the
length threshold in gold summaries). We also
considered the oracle’s performance by averaging
over the ROUGE scores of all human summaries
calculated by considering one human summary
against others in each topic. As far as 100
words summaries, since we did not have gold
summaries of that length, we considered the first
100 words from each gold summary. Figure 2
shows the box-and-whisker plots with ROUGE
scores. For each metric, the scores of each
summarizer in comparison with the baselines for
100 word summaries and 250 words summaries
are shown. The citation-context for all the
methods were identified by the citation text vector
method which uses the citation text except for
numeric values, stop words and citation markers
(first method in section 3.1). In section 5.3,
we analyze the effect of various citation-context
extraction methods that we discussed in section 3

on the final summary. The name of each
of our methods is shortened by the following
convention: [Summarization approach] [Sentence
selection strategy]. Summarization approach is
based on either community detection (Citation-
Context-Comm) or discourse model of the article
(Citation-Context-Disc) and sentence selection
strategy can be iterative (It) or by relevance and
diversification (Div).

We can clearly observe that our proposed
methods achieve encouraging results in
comparison with existing baselines. Specifically,
for 100 words short summaries, the discourse
based method (with 34.6% mean ROUGE-L
improvement over the best baseline) and for 250
word summaries, the community based method
(with 3.5% mean ROUGE-L improvement over the
best baseline) are the best performing methods.
We observe relative consistency between different
rouge scores for each summarization approach.
Grouping citation-context based on both the
discourse structure and the communities show
comparable results. The community detection
approach is thus effectively able to identify
diverse aspects of the article. The discourse
model of the scientific article is also able to
diversify selection of citation contexts for the final
summary. These results confirm our hypotheses
that using the citation context along with the
discourse model of the scientific articles can help
producing better summaries.

Comparison of performance of methods on
individual topics showed that the citation-context
methods consistently over perform all other
methods in most of the topics (65% of all topics).

While the discourse approach shows
encouraging results, we attribute its limitation
in achieving higher ROUGE scores to the
classification errors that we observed in intrinsic
classification evaluation. In evaluating the
performance of several classifiers, linear SVM
achieved the highest performance with accuracy
of 0.788 in comparison with human annotation
performance. Many of the citations cannot exactly
belong to only one of the discourse facets of
the paper and thus some errors in classification
are inevitable. This is also observable in
disagreements between the annotators in labeling
as reported by (Cohan et al., 2014). This fact
influences the diversification and finally the
summarization quality.

Among baseline summarization approaches,
LexRank performs relatively well. Its
performance is the best for short summaries
among other baselines. This is expected since
LexRank tries to find the most central sentences.
When the length of the summary is short, the
main idea in the summary is usually captured by
finding the most representative sentence which
LexRank can effectively achieve. However, the
sentences that it chooses are usually about the
same topic. Hence, the diversity in the gold
summaries is not considered. This becomes more
visible when we observe 250 word summaries.
Our discourse based method can overcome this
problem by including important contents for
diverse discourse facets (34.6% mean ROUGE-L
improvement for 100 words summaries and
13.9% improvement for 250 word summaries).
The community based approach achieves the
same diversification effect in an unsupervised
fashion by forming citation-context communities
(27.16% mean ROUGE-L improvement for 100
words summaries and 14.9% improvement for
250 word summaries).

The citation based summarization baseline
has somewhat average performance among the
baseline methods. This confirms that relying only
on the citations can not be optimal for scientific
summarization. While LSA approach performs
relatively well, we observe lower scores for all
variations of MMR approaches. We attribute
the low performance of MMR to its sub optimal
greedy selection of sentences from relatively long
scientific articles.

By comparing the two sentence selection
approaches (i.e., iterative and diversification-
relevance), we observe that while for shorter
length summaries the method based on
diversification performs better, for the longer
summaries results for the two methods are
comparable. This is because when the length
threshold is smaller, iterative approach may fail
to select best representative sentences from all
the groups. It essentially selects one sentence
from each group until the length threshold is met,
and consequently misses some aspects. Whereas,
the diversification method selects sentences that
maximize the gain in informativeness and at
the same time contributes to the novelty of the
summary. In longer summaries, due to larger
threshold, iterative approach seems to be able

397



Figure 3: Comparison of the effect of different citation-context extraction methods on the quality of the final summary.

to select the top sentences from each group,
enabling it to reflect different aspect of the
paper. Therefore, the iterative approach performs
comparably well to the diversification approach.
This outcome is expected because the number of
groups are small. For discourse method, there are
5 different discourse facets and for community
method, on average 5.2 communities are detected.
Hence, iterative selection can select sentences
from most of these groups within 250 words limit
summaries.

5.3 Analysis of strategies for citation-context
extraction

Figure 3 shows ROUGE-L results for 250 words
summaries based on using different citation-
context extraction approaches, described in
section 3.1. Relatively comparable performance
for all the approaches is achieved. Using
the citation text for extracting the context is
almost as effective as other methods. Keywords
approach which uses the terms with high idf
values for locating the context achieves slightly
higher Rouge-L precision while it has the lowest
recall. This is expected since keywords approach
chooses only informative terms for extracting
citation-contexts. This results in missing terms
that may not be keywords by themselves but
help providing meaning. Noun phrases has
the highest mean F-score and thus suggests the
fact that noun phrases are good indicators of
important concepts in scientific text. We attribute
the high recall of noun phrases to the fact that
most important concepts are captured by only
selecting noun phrases. Interestingly, introducing
biomedical concepts and expanding the citation
vector by related concepts does not improve

the performance. This approach achieves a
relatively higher recall but a lower mean precision.
While capturing domain concepts along with noun
phrases helps improving the performance, adding
related concepts to the citation vector causes
drift from the original context as expressed in
the reference article. Therefore some decline in
performance is incurred.

6 Conclusion

We proposed a pipeline approach for
summarization of scientific articles which
takes advantage of the article’s inherent discourse
model and citation-contexts extracted from the
reference article1. Our approach focuses on the
problem of lack of context in existing citation
based summarization approaches. We effectively
achieved improvement over several well known
summarization approaches on the TAC2014
biomedical summarization dataset. That is, in all
cases we improved over the baselines; in some
cases we obtained greater than 30% improvement
for mean ROUGE scores over the best performing
baseline. While the dataset we use for evaluation
of scientific articles is in biomedical domain,
most of our approaches are general and therefore
adaptable to other scientific domains.
