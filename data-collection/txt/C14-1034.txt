Abstract 

In this paper, we have studied the effect of two important factors influencing text readability in 

Bangla: the target reader and text properties. Accordingly, at first we have built a novel Bangla 

readability dataset of 135 documents annotated by 50 readers from two different backgrounds. 

We have identified 20 different features that can affect the readability of Bangla texts; the 

features were divided in two groups, namely, „classic‟ and „non-classic‟. Preliminary 

correlation analysis reveals that text features have varying influence on the text hardness stated 

by the two groups. We have employed support vector machine (SVM) and support vector 

regression (SVR) techniques to model the reading difficulties of Bangla texts. In addition to 

developing different models targeted towards different type of readers, separate combinations 

of features were tested to evaluate their comparative contributions. Our study establishes that 

the perception of text difficulty varies largely with the background of the reader. To the best of 

our knowledge, no such work on text readability has been recorded earlier in Bangla.  

1 Introduction 

Readability of a text generally refers to how well a reader is able to comprehend the content of a text, 

through reading (Dale and Chall, 1948). Readability is a complex cognitive phenomenon where, the 

cognitive load of a text for a reader depends on both the characteristics of a text like, lexical choice, 

syntactic complexity, semantic complexity, discourse level complexity and on the background of the 

user. Several experiments have already established that readability of texts are quite language 

dependent and existing readability measures in English cannot directly be used to compute readability 

of other languages like, Bangla and Hindi (Sinha et al., 2012). Yet, compared to the numerous 

readability measures in English and other European languages(Benjamin, 2012), few initiatives have 

been taken to compute text readability in a Eastern Indo-Aryan language like Bangla or any other 

Indian languages which are structurally very different from many of their Indo-European cousins such 

as English, which is of West-Germanic descent (Sinha et al., 2012). One important factor that affects 

the readability of a text is the background of the respective reader. According to Dale (Dale, 1949), 

“The interpretation of the expressed thought is related more to the reader‟s informational background 

and motivations than to the internal evidences of the expressional facility of the author”. Reader‟s 

background is a complex derivative of one‟s educational and socio-economic state. As per one of the 

pioneering works in readability by Dale and Chall (1949), the outcome of reading depends on many 

characteristics of the prospective readers including “reading abilities, interests, age, sex, intellectual

maturity, background of information etc.”  However, we do not know of any such investigations for 

Bangla text readability that have investigate the way background of a reader affect the readability of 

text. Such language specific study is needed as Bangla as a language is very different from English 

and the inapplicability of English readability formulae for Bangla text has already been established. 

Considering the above issues as our motivation, in this paper we have developed models to predict 

reading difficulty of a Bangla document perceived according to different target reader groups. To 

categorize among different reader groups, we have considered age, education and socio-economic data 

as indicators of comprehension ability. In addition, we have also explored the impact of different types 

of text features on text comprehensibility in Bangla. However, development and evaluation of such 

model requires availability of well-annotated resources. To the best of our knowledge, no 

automatically accessible data annotated according to the reading difficulty level is available for 

Bangla. Therefore, we have developed a digital resource pool of Bangla text documents in Unicode 

encoding that can be used for various NLP tasks such as feature extraction, document analysis etc. 

Such a dataset is essential to analyze readability of text documents based on the target reader. Next, 

we have visualized the text readability problem from a machine learning perspective as a classification 

problem using support vector machines (SVM) and an estimation problem using support vector 

regression (SVR). Our study is based on a wide range of textual features, from the syntactic and 

lexical features of a text like, its average sentence length, average word length in terms of visual units, 

to discourse level features like, number of jukta-akshars (consonant conjuncts) , number of different 

parts of speeches, named entity and lexical relations (refer to section 3). Although regression analysis 

has been previously used to model the text readability in Bangla, reader group specific analysis and 

machine learning techniques like support vectors have not been used so far. We have considered two 

target reader groups namely Group-1(or Adult group) with average age of 23 Yrs and Group-2 (or 

minor‟s group) with average age of 15 Yrs.   

The organization of the paper is as follows: section 2 presents a brief literature survey on existing 

readability metrics for English and Bangla; section 3 defines the features of a text considered in this 

study, and empirical data collection, section 4 discusses the experiment observations, the prediction 

techniques and presents the results and validations for the two techniques. Finally, section 5 offers 

conclusion and perspective. 

2 Related Works 

The quantitative analysis of text readability started with L.A. Sherman in 1880 (Sherman, 1893). Till 

date, English and other languages have got over 200 readability metrics (DuBay, 2004; Rabin et al., 

1988).The existing quantitative approaches towards predicting readability of a text can be broadly 

classified into three categories (Benjamin, 2012):  

Classical methods: they analyze the syntactic features of a text like sentence length, paragraph 

length etc. The examples are Flesch Reading Ease Score (Flesch, 1948), FOG index (Gunning, 1968), 

Fry graph (Fry, 1968), SMOG (McLaughlin, 1969) etc. The formulae do not take into account the 

background of the reader and the semantic features of the text such as whether the actual contents are 

making sense or not. Despite their shortcomings, these simple metrics are easy to calculate and 

provide a rough estimation of reading difficulty of a text provided. 

Cognitively motivated methods: texts are analyzed based on the cognitive features like, cohesion, 

organization and users‟ background. Proposition and inference model (Kintsch and Van Dijk, 1978), 

prototype theory (Rosch, 1978), latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998), Coh-metrix (Graesser 

et al., 2004) are some prominent members of this group. This group of models moves beyond the 

surface features of a text and try to measure objectively the different cognitive indicators associated 

with text and the reader. However, it has been observed that, many situations, some traditional 

indicators perform as well as the newer and more difficult versions (Crossley et al., 2007). 

Statistical language modeling: This class of approaches incorporates the power machine learning 

methods to the field of readability. They are particularly useful in determining readability of web texts 

(Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004; Si and Callan, 2003) (Liu 

et al., 2004). SVM has been used to identify grammatical patterns within a text and classification 

based on it (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2008; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009). 

Although, these methods sound promising, the problem is that they cannot act as standalone measure: 

346



they need an amount of training data for classifiers appropriate to a particular user group and often 

these measures takes into account complex text features which for resource poor languages need 

manual effort to annotate. 

In Bangla, only a couple of works have been executed on text readability. Das and Roychoudhury 

(Das and Roychoudhury, 2006) studied a miniature model with respect to one parametric and two 

parametric fits. They have used seven paragraphs from seven literary texts. They considered two 

structural features of a text: average sentence length and number of syllables per 100 words. They 

found the two-parametric fit as better performer. Sinha et al. (Sinha et al., 2012) has developed two 

readability formulae for Bangla texts using regression analysis. For their study sixteen texts of length, 

about 100 words were used. They have considered six structural or syntactic features of a text for the 

work. They have demonstrated that the English readability formulae such as Flesch Reading Ease 

Index, SMOG Index do not perform appropriately while being applied to Bangla documents. They 

have found the textual features like average word length, number of polysyllabic words and number of 

jukta-akshars in a text to be the most influential ones. Both the works mentioned have taken into 

account a small subset of potentially important text features; none them have considered feature such 

as the extent of text cohesion. Moreover, their study did not explore the influence of readers‟ 

background on text readability. In our study, we have addressed the issue of readers‟ background as 

well as the effect of features at different textual level. 

3 Empirical Data Collection 

As mentioned, there is no annotated data present in Bangla, which can provide a direct classification 

of text difficulty for Bangla readers. Therefore, we have undertaken an effort to annotate the 

experiment texts with the target readers of Bangla.  

3.1 Participants 

Our objective in this study is to investigate how readability varies with the background of the reader. 

Therefore, two different target reader groups have been considered to study the relationship of effect 

of text parameters on comprehension and user background. SEC

 or socio-economic classification has 

been stated according to the standards of Market Research Society of India (MRSI). MRSI has defined 

12 socio-economic strata: A1 to E3, in the decreasing order. These strata have been designed based on 

the education level of the chief wage earner of the family and the number of “consumer durables” (as 

per a predefined list including agricultural land) owned by the family. It has been seen that this way of 

grading reflect the social and economic position of a household in terms of fields such as education, 

awareness etc. As can be inferred from the chart, the participants range from classes C2 to E1 (C2, D1, 

D2, E1), which represents the medium to low social-economic classes.

3.2 Readability corpus preparation 

We have stated in the introduction about the scarcity of annotated digital resource pool in Bangla 

useful for automatic processing. Although there are a few works on text readability in Bangla, the data 

is not available in accessible formats. To address the problem, we have developed a corpus of Bangla 

documents. The current size of the resource is about 250 documents of length about 2000 words 

spanning over broad categories such as News, literature, blogs, articles etc. A number of different text

features were computed against each document. The descriptions of the features and the justification 

for them have been stated below. 

3.3 Feature selection: 

Inferring from the cognitive load theory (Paas et al., 2003), we have assumed that the cognitive load 

exerted by a text on a reader depends on syntactic and lexical properties of a text like, average 

sentence length, average word length, number of polysyllabic words and as well as discourse features 

like the counts of the different parts of speeches and the number of co-references one has to resolve in 

order to comprehend the text. The logic behind such assumptions is as follows: while processing a text 

a user has to parse the sentences in it and extract semantically relevant meaning from those sentences 

and the words. In order to process a sentence, one has to take into account the length of the sentence 

and types of words contained in it; in addition, to infer the meaning of a sentence, it is important to 

establish the connections or the nature of dependencies among the different words in a sentence. The 

role of a word is determined by its parts of speech and its way of use in that context; apart from it, the 

words can have varied complexity based on factors like their length, count of syllables. Similarly, at 

the discourse level, a reader not only has to comprehend each sentence or paragraph, but also has to 

infer the necessary co-references among them to understand the message conveyed by the text. The 

complexity of this task depends on the number of entities (noun, proper nouns) in the text, how one 

entity is connected with other, relationships like synonymy, polysemy, and hyponymy. To capture the 

effects of all these parameters in our readability models, we have considered text features over a broad 

range. The details of the features are presented in Table 2. The word features like average word length, 

average syllable per word, sentence features like average sentence length and discourse features like 

number of polysyllabic words, number of jukta-akshars (consonant conjuncts) have been calculated as 

stated by Sinha et al. (Sinha et al., 2012), as the features need customizations for Bangla. The 

calculations based on lexical chains have been followed from Galley and McKeown (Galley and 

McKeown, 2003).  

 
Feature Description 

word features 

average word length Bangla orthographic word consists of a combination of four types of graphemes
2
, 

each of them is considered as a single visual unit. Average word length is total 

word length in terms of visual units divided by number of words. 

average syllable per word Total word length in terms of syllable divided by total number of words. 

sentence features 

average sentence length Total sentence length in terms of words divided by number of sentence. 

$(noun phrase) Average number of NP per sentence 

$(verb phrase) Average number of VP per sentence 

$(adjective) Average number of adjectives per sentence 

$(postposition) Average number of postpositions per sentence. Bangla grammar has postpositions, 

instead of prepositions present in English. Unlike English, postpositions in Bangla 

do not belong to separate part of speech. The postpositions require their object 

noun to take possessive, objective or locative case. Suffixes act as the case 

markers.  

$(entity) average number of named entity per sentence 

$(unique entity) Average number of unique entity per sentence 

$(clauses) Average number of clauses per sentence

Table2: Details of text features considered for the study 

The features marked with * in the above table have been manually annotated against each text. The other 

features, though they are computed automatically, a round of manual checking was incorporated for the sake of 

correctness. 

Expert annotations and user annotations: 

Since there is no formal ranking of Bangla texts according to their reading levels, therefore, the 

documents were then annotated by language experts to approximate the suitable reading level for each 

document. However, to develop any practical readability application, feedbacks from actual users are 

necessary. From the resource pool mentioned in Introduction, 135 texts were chosen for the present 

study: two sets of distinct 45 texts were for each group: for the adult group those were the texts 

annotated by experts to have relatively high reading level and for the minor‟s group, the texts were 

annotated as having relatively low reading level; pairwise t-test were performed between the two type 

of text features to assure that their difference is significant (p<0.05).  

The rest 45 texts are common to both the groups to account for the difference in comprehension for 

the same document and the assumption that may in some cases group 2 participants have comparable 

reading skill as of group 1: consequently, the texts annotated by experts as demanding high reading 

level were selected for this purpose. These were required to ensure that the experimental data spans 

over a broad range and is unbiased. The text details are presented in table 2 below.

Each participant was asked 2 questions: “How easy was it for you to understand/comprehend the 

text?” and “How interesting was the reading to you?”. Against each question, they were to answer on a 

5 point scale (1=easy, 5=very hard). Inter-rater reliability was measured through Krippendorff‟s alpha

and 𝛼 = 0.81 was found. Therefore, we concluded that annotators agree more often than would have 
occurred by chance. We have measured the correlation between the outcomes of two questions 

corresponding to each of the fifty annotators; and found that in each case the correlation was greater 

than 0.8 (p < 0.05). Therefore, the questions can be considered as equivalent, and subsequently we 

have considered the rating for the first question as user input for our readability models. 

Corresponding to each text, the average of the user ratings was considered for further processing.  

4 Analysis and Model Development 

4.1 Correlation coefficients 

We have performed partial spearman correlation between each of the features and user rating. Table 4 

presents some of the examples from each type of features due to the space limitation; results 

corresponding to other features are also described subsequently. The following features have selected 

as they have been used in the existing literature for Bangla (Sinha et al., 2012). The correlations are 

presented separately for the distinct texts and the common texts delivered to the two groups of users. 

This will allow us to investigate is there any significance difference of reading feedbacks between the 

different target populations.

Table 4: Correlation coefficients (user rating vs text features) 

Some interesting observations can be made from the above table: 

 Average sentence length or mean number of words per sentence have been long found to be a 
strong predictor of text difficulty [1]. In our case, while this holds true for the adult data, the 

correlation is less for the minors and it is not significant. 

 Average syllable per word does not hold significant correlation for the adult data in both cases 
but it does for the minor‟s group  

 Jukta-akshars or consonant conjuncts have major impact on text readability in Bangla (Sinha 
et al., 2012). For adult data, it can be seen that this feature has a strong and significant 

correlation, which not true for the user data of group 2 for separate texts. On the other hand, for 

the common texts this feature was found to have high significant correlation with both the 

reader groups. This is may be due to the nature of the common texts.  

 Apart from the above two cases, the above table also presents evidence in support of the fact 
that the reader‟s perception of text difficulty in relation to text features changes with the target 

reader background. 

The impact of the remaining features has been discussed here with respect to the two different types of 

text scenarios: 

350



Distinct texts for two groups: 

 In case of the readers from the first group, the user ratings have high correlation (𝑟 > 0.65) 
with $(clauses), #(verb phrases), #( unique entity), #(lexical chain) and  average lexical chain 

length. The correlations are also significant. However, the correlations with $(noun phrase), 

$(verb phrase) $(postpositions), #(postpositions), #(adjective) were found to be insignificant. 

The correlation of user annotation with features such as $(entity), $(unique entity) were found 

to be low (𝑟 < 0.45) but significant.  

 The group 2 readers were found to show high (𝑟 > 0.65) and significant correlation with $(verb 
phrases), $(unique entity), $(clauses), #(entity), #(lexical chain) and average lexical chain span. 

The correlations with $(postposition), #(postpositions) were not significant. Features like 

$(noun phrase), $(adjective) and #(adjective) were found to have low (𝑟 < 0.45) but significant 
correlations with user ratings. 

Common texts for both groups: 

 It has been observed that the group 2 user ratings have higher correlation with the sentence level 
features than the discourse level features. In particular, features such as number of $(noun 

phrase), $(adjective), $(unique entity) and $(clauses) have high correlation with the text 

difficulty ratings provided by the minor‟s group. Among the discourse level features #(entity) 

and #(unique entity)have a high correlation, but #(verb phrase), #(adjective) were found to have 

not significant influence. 

 On the other hand, the adult data are more inclined towards discourse features such as #(noun 
phrase) and #(verb phrase),  #(unique entity) in a document. This may be due to the ability of 

the older people to comprehend the text as a whole rather than inferring meaning from 

individual units at a time. From sentence level feature $(clause) was found to be significant and 

important in terms of correlation, but $(noun phrase), $(adjective) do not bear significant 

correlation. 

 Properties like lexical chain, which require a reader to establish connections among different 
attributes of a concept have great significance for both group1 and group2 annotations.  

 For both the user groups the influence of average $(postposition and #(postposition) were found 
to be little and insignificant. 

From the above discussions, it is evident that the two different target reader groups show a large 

difference in their reading pattern and perception of text difficulty. The difference has been observed 

in both the cases: when they were presented with different type of texts and with same texts. 

Therefore, it has been established that the target reader background plays an important role in 

modelling text difficulty. Accordingly, in the following sections, we have developed different models 

of different reader groups, and in the process we have also shown that the models have different 

parameter values and configurations. 

4.2 Computational modelling 

Analyses of correlation coefficients give an estimation of trend in user ratings against text features. 

The next step is to develop suitable models for automatic readability prediction. To achieve the 

objective, we have used machine-learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and 

support vector regression (SVR) techniques. In addition, we have also presented a comparative study 

of performances of different text features in readability model building in this section. The features 

have been used in three combinations. First they were divided in  two categories i) comprising of only 

the six features mentioned in table 4 as they represent the „classical‟ features used extensively to 

model text readability, and ii) second category consists of the rest 14 features and the group is termed 

„non-classical‟ , this yielded the first two combinations. The third combination consists of all the 

features. Therefore, we have evaluated six different types of SVM and SVR models for each group. 

We have employed a binary SVM classifier here. Given a training set instance-class pairs (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖  ), i 

= 1…l, where 𝑥𝑖 ∈  𝑅
𝑛   and 𝑦 ∈   1, −1 l  , the general equation of a SVM is (Manning et al., 2008):

In this work, we have taken 90 texts against each group of users by combining the 45 reader group 

specific texts and 45 common texts (refer to section 3). Then for each category of reader, the texts 

were shuffled randomly. We have used 70 texts for training and 20 texts for evaluation of the model 

and performed 2-fold cross validation. The minimum, maximum and median of the rating distribution 

lie respectively at (2.33), (8.4) and (5.92) for adult (group1) and at (1.83), (8.2) and (5.5) for minor 

(group 2). To train and test the SVM models, we needed to spit the data in two classes ( easy and 

hard), this has been done by assigning the ratings less than the median in to class easy (label „-1‟) and 

the rest to the class hard (label „1‟), i.e., the user ratings were mapped to the label space 𝑦. In case of 
SVR, the label space mapping was not required. The text features were mapped to the feature space 𝑥𝑖 . 
Although we have tested four types of kernel functions: linear, polynomial, radial basis and sigmoid 

on the data using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) software, here only the results corresponding to 

linear and polynomial kernels have been presented as the other two kernels performed poorly.  To 

evaluate the quality of the classifications for SVM, multiple correlation (R) and percentage of texts 

accurately classified (Acc) have been used. R denotes the extent to which the predictions are close to 

the actual classes and its square (R
2
) indicates the percentage of dependent variable variation that can 

be explained by the model. Therefore, while percentage accuracy is an indicator to how well the model 

has performed to classify, R indicates the extent of explanatory power it posses. A better fit will have 

large R-value as well as Acc. For SVR, root mean square error (RMSE) has been reported instead of 

Acc; a good fit will have less RMSE. Below tables present, the SVM and SVR results for adult and 

minor‟s data for different kernels and different combination of features. The kernels were evaluated 

for a number of SVM parameter combinations and only the result corresponding to the most efficient 

one is presented.

Table 8: SVR for group2 readers 

From table 5 and table 6, it can be seen that the SVM for the two target reader groups differ 

significantly in term of parameter attributes and their accuracy. It is also evident that incorporating 

only non-classic features versus classic features improves the accuracy of SVM very slightly and both 

types of features have similar explanatory power; combining both the classic and non -classic feature 

improves the accuracy and multiple correlations significantly. The SVR from table 7 and table 8 show 

the similar trend in terms of feature performances: classic and non-classis features have comparable 

RMSE and R, but there is significant gain when the two types are taken together. The regression 

equations for group1 and group2 readers differ in the coefficients of the feature variables; these imply 

that the two groups require different readability models. Moreover, the linear kernel was found to 

perform better than the polynomial kernel in all the cases. 

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we have studied the effect of two important factors affecting text readability in Bangla: 

the target reader and text properties. We have found that the perception of text difficulty varies largely 

with the background of the reader. Accordingly, we have developed computational models to compute 

readability of Bangla text documents based on the target reader group. In order to achieve our goal we 

have first developed a novel Bangla dataset annotated in terms of text readability by users with 

varying age group. A preliminary analysis of the reading pattern of each target group was performed 

by analysing the correlation of text features with user annotations. Next, we have applied the SVM 

classifier to classify text documents into two different classes namely, hard and easy; the SVM for the 

two reader groups have different properties, implying the difference between two corresponding 

models. We have also compared the performance of the classifier based on the feature set they use. 

We observed that in contrast to applying only the classical features or the non-classic features, 

performance of the classifier improves if both types of features are used. This is true for both the adult 

as well as the minor‟s dataset. Overall, we have achieved an accuracy of around 86% for the minor‟s 

dataset and 87% for the adult dataset respectively. In addition to classification, support vector 

regression has been used to model text difficulty from an estimation perspective. The result of the 

SVR also establishes our previous findings. To the best of our knowledge, no such work on text 

readability has been recorded earlier in Indian languages, especially in Bangla. The next step of this 

study is to analyse the performance of the readability formula from one group (say adult) when applied 

to the other group (say minors) and vice versa. We will also repeat our study with more spread apart 

user groups spread over less diverse economic strata. In future, we are planning to develop for multi-

class text readability models. The work will also be extended to model text comprehensibility for 

reading disabilities in Bangla.
