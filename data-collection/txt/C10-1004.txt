Abstract

While subjectivity related research in
other languages has increased, most of the
work focuses on single languages. This
paper explores the integration of features
originating from multiple languages into
a machine learning approach to subjectiv-
ity analysis, and aims to show that this
enriched feature set provides for more ef-
fective modeling for the source as well
as the target languages. We show not
only that we are able to achieve over
75% macro accuracy in all of the six lan-
guages we experiment with, but also that
by using features drawn from multiple
languages we can construct high-precision
meta-classiﬁers with a precision of over
83%.
Introduction

1
Following the terminology proposed by (Wiebe
et al., 2005), subjectivity and sentiment analysis
focuses on the automatic identiﬁcation of private
states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments,
evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural
language. While subjectivity classiﬁcation labels
text as either subjective or objective, sentiment or
polarity classiﬁcation adds an additional level of
granularity, by further classifying subjective text
as either positive, negative or neutral.

To date, a large number of text processing ap-
plications have used techniques for automatic sen-
timent and subjectivity analysis, including auto-
matic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et
al., 1990), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line
forums and news (Balog et al., 2006; Lloyd et al.,
2005), and mining opinions from product reviews
(Hu and Liu, 2004).
In many natural language
processing tasks, subjectivity and sentiment clas-
siﬁcation has been used as a ﬁrst phase ﬁltering to

generate more viable data. Research that beneﬁted
from this additional layering ranges from ques-
tion answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003),
to conversation summarization (Carenini et al.,
2008), and text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mi-
halcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a).

Although subjectivity tends to be preserved
across languages – see the manual study in (Mi-
halcea et al., 2007), (Banea et al., 2008) hypoth-
esize that subjectivity is expressed differently in
various languages due to lexicalization, formal
versus informal markers, etc. Based on this obser-
vation, our research seeks to answer the following
questions. First, can we reliably predict sentence-
level subjectivity in languages other than English,
by leveraging on a manually annotated English
dataset? Second, can we improve the English sub-
jectivity classiﬁcation by expanding the feature
space through the use of multilingual data? Sim-
ilarly, can we also improve the classiﬁers in the
other target languages? Finally, third, can we ben-
eﬁt from the multilingual subjectivity space and
build a high-precision subjectivity classiﬁer that
could be used to generate subjectivity datasets in
the target languages?

The paper is organized as follows. We intro-
duce the datasets and the general framework in
Section 2. Sections 3, 4, and 5 address in turn each
of the three research questions mentioned above.
Section 6 describes related literature in the area
of multilingual subjectivity. Finally, we draw our
conclusions in Section 7.

2 Multilingual Datasets
Corpora that are manually annotated for subjec-
tivity, polarity, or emotion, are available in only
select languages, since they require a consider-
able amount of human effort. Due to this im-
pediment, the focus of this paper is to create a
method for extrapolating subjectivity data devel-

Riloff, 2005)

oped in a source language and to transfer it to
other languages. Multilingual feature spaces are
generated to create even better subjectivity classi-
ﬁers, outperforming those trained on the individ-
ual languages alone.

We use the Multi-Perspective Question An-
swering (MPQA) corpus, consisting of 535
English-language news articles from a variety
of sources, manually annotated for subjectivity
(Wiebe et al., 2005). Although the corpus is an-
notated at the clause and phrase levels, we use
the sentence-level annotations associated with the
dataset in (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005). A sentence
is labeled as subjective if it has at least one pri-
vate state of strength medium or higher. Other-
wise the sentence is labeled as objective. From the
approximately 9700 sentences in this corpus, 55%
of them are labeled as subjective, while the rest
are objective. Therefore, 55% represents the ma-
jority baseline on this corpus. (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005) apply both a subjective and an objective
rule-based classiﬁer to the MPQA corpus data and
obtain the results presented in Table 1.1

In order to generate parallel corpora to MPQA
in other languages, we rely on the method we pro-
posed in (Banea et al., 2008). We experiment with
ﬁve languages other than English (En), namely
Arabic (Ar), French (Fr), German (De), Roma-
nian (Ro) and Spanish (Es). Our choice of lan-
guages is motivated by several reasons. First,
we wanted languages that are highly lexicalized
and have clear word delimitations. Second, we
were interested to cover languages that are simi-
lar to English as well as languages with a com-
pletely different etymology. Consideration was
given to include Asian languages, such as Chi-
nese or Japanese, but the fact that their script with-

respectively.

out word-segmentation preprocessing does not di-
rectly map to words was a deterrent. Finally, an-
other limitation on our choice of languages is the
need for a publicly available machine translation
system between the source language and each of
the target languages.

We construct a subjectivity annotated corpus
for each of the ﬁve languages by using machine
translation to transfer the source language data
into the target language. We then project the orig-
inal sentence level English subjectivity labeling
onto the target data. For all languages, other than
Romanian, we use the Google Translate service,2
a publicly available machine translation engine
based on statistical models. The reason Roma-
nian is not included in this group is that, at the
time when we performed the ﬁrst experiments,
Google Translate did not provide a translation ser-
vice for this language.
Instead, we used an al-
ternative statistical translation system called Lan-
guageWeaver,3 which was commercially avail-
able, and which the company kindly allowed us
to use for research purposes.

for

Given the speciﬁcs of each language, we em-
ploy several preprocessing techniques. For Ro-
manian, French, English, German and Spanish,
we remove all the diacritics, numbers and punc-
tuation marks except - and ’. The exceptions are
motivated by the fact that they may mark contrac-
tions, such as En: it’s or Ro: s-ar (may be), and
the component words may not be resolved to the
correct forms. For Arabic, although it has a dif-
ferent encoding, we wanted to make sure to treat
it in a way similar to the languages with a Roman

alphabet. We therefore use a library4 that maps
Arabic script to a space of Roman-alphabet letters
supplemented with punctuation marks so that they
can allow for additional dimensionality.

Once the corpora are preprocessed, each sen-
tence is deﬁned by six views: one in the origi-
nal source language (English), and ﬁve obtained
through automatic translation in each of the tar-
get languages. Multiple datasets that cover all
possible combinations of six languages taken one
through six (a total of 63 combinations) are gen-
erated. These datasets feature a vector for each
sentence present in MPQA (approximately 9700).
The vector contains only unigram features in one
language for a monolingual dataset. For a mul-
tilingual dataset, the vector represents a cumu-
lation of monolingual unigram features extracted
from each view of the sentence. For example, one
of the combinations of six taken three is Arabic-
German-English. For this combination, the vector
is composed of unigram features extracted from
each of the Arabic, German and English transla-
tions of the sentence.

We perform ten-fold cross validation and train
Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁers with feature selection on
each dataset combination. The top 20% of the fea-
tures present in the training data are retained. For
datasets resulting from combinations of all lan-
guages taken one, the classiﬁers are monolingual
classiﬁers. All other classiﬁers are multilingual,
and their feature space increases with each addi-
tional language added. Expanding the feature set
by encompassing a group of languages enables us
to provide an answer to two problems that can ap-
pear due to data sparseness. First, enough training
data may not be available in the monolingual cor-
pus alone in order to correctly infer labeling based
on statistical measures. Second, features appear-
ing in the monolingual test set may not be present
in the training set and therefore their information
cannot be used to generate a correct classiﬁcation.
Both of these problems are further explained
through the examples below, where we make the
simplifying assumption that the words in italics
are the only potential carriers of subjective con-
tent, and that, without them, their surrounding

4Lingua::AR::Word PERL library.

contexts would be objective. Therefore, their as-
sociation with an either objective or subjective
meaning imparts to the entire segment the same
labeling upon classiﬁcation.

To explore the ﬁrst sparseness problem, let us
consider the following two examples extracted
from the English version of the MPQA dataset,
followed by their machine translations in German:

“En 1: rights group Amnesty Interna-
tional said it was concerned about the
high risk of violence in the aftermath”
“En 2: ofﬁcial said that US diplomats
to countries concerned are authorized
to explain to these countries”
“De 1: Amnesty International sagte, es
sei besorgt ¨uber das hohe Risiko von
Gewalt in der Folgezeit”
“De 2:

berechtigt
erkl¨aren”

L¨ander

sind,

We focus our discussion on the word con-
cerned, which in the ﬁrst example is used in its
subjective sense, while in the second it carries an
objective meaning (as it refers to a group of coun-
tries exhibiting a particular feature deﬁned ear-
lier on in the context). The words in italics in
the German contexts represent the translations of
concerned into German, which are functionally
different as they are shaped by their surrounding
context. By training a classiﬁer on the English ex-
amples alone, under the data sparseness paradigm,
the machine learning model may not differentiate
between the word’s objective and subjective uses
when predicting a label for the entire sentence.
However, appending the German translation to the
examples generates additional dimensions for this
model and allows the classiﬁer to potentially dis-
tinguish between the senses and provide the cor-
rect sentence label.

For the second problem, let us consider two
other examples from the English MPQA and their
respective translations into Romanian:

“En 3: could secure concessions on Tai-
wan in return for supporting Bush on is-
sues such as anti-terrorism and”

Table 2: Na¨ıve Bayes learners trained on six individual languages

“Ro 4: la potent¸ialul de schimbare din

noastre s¸i centre de comunitate este un
bun”

In this case, supporting is used in both English ex-
amples in senses that are both subjective; the word
is, however, translated into Romanian through two
synonyms, namely sust¸inerea and sprijinirea. Let
us assume that sufﬁcient training examples are
available to strengthen a link between support-
ing and sust¸inerea, and the classiﬁer is presented
with a context containing sprijinirea, unseen in
the training data. A multilingual classiﬁer may be
able to predict a label for the context using the co-
occurrence metrics based on supporting and ex-
trapolate a label when the context contains both
the English word and its translation into Roma-
nian as sprijinirea. For a monolingual classiﬁer,
such an inference is not possible, and the fea-
ture is discarded. Therefore a multi-lingual classi-
ﬁer model may gain additional strength from co-
occurring words across languages.

3 Question 1
Can we reliably predict sentence-level sub-
jectivity in languages other than English, by
leveraging on a manually annotated English
dataset?
In (Banea et al., 2008), we explored several meth-
ods for porting subjectivity annotated data from

a source language (English) to a target language
(Romanian and Spanish). Here, we focus on the
transfer of manually annotated corpora through
the usage of machine translation by projecting the
original sentence level annotations onto the gener-
ated parallel text in the target language. Our aim
is not to improve on that method, but rather to ver-
ify that the results are reliable across a number of
languages. Therefore, we conduct this experiment
in several additional languages, namely French,
German and Arabic, and compare the results with
those obtained for Spanish and Romanian.

Table 2 shows the results obtained using Na¨ıve
Bayes classiﬁers trained in each language individ-
ually, with a macro accuracy ranging from 71.30%
(for Arabic) to 73.89% (for English).5 As ex-
pected, the English machine learner outperforms
those trained on other languages, as the original
language of the annotations is English. However,
it is worth noting that all measures do not deviate
by more than 3.27%, implying that classiﬁers built
using this technique exhibit a consistent behavior
across languages.

4 Question 2

Can we improve the English subjectivity clas-
siﬁcation by expanding the feature space
through the use of multilingual data? Simi-
larly, can we also improve the classiﬁers in the
other target languages?
We now turn towards investigating the impact on
subjectivity classiﬁcation of an expanded feature
space through the inclusion of multilingual data.
In order to methodically assess classiﬁer behavior,
we generate multiple datasets containing all pos-

5Note that the experiments conducted in (Banea et al.,
2008) were made on a different test set, and thus the results
are not directly comparable across the two papers.

Table 3: Average measures for a particular number of languages in a combination (from one through

sible combinations of one through six languages,
as described in Section 2. We then train Na¨ıve
Bayes learners on the multilingual data and av-
erage our results per each group comprised of a
particular number of languages. For example, for
one language, we have the six individual classi-
ﬁers described in Section 3; for the group of three
languages, the average is calculated over 20 pos-
sible combinations; and so on.

Table 3 shows the results of this experiment.
We can see that the overall F-measure increases
from 73.08% – which is the average over one lan-
guage – to 75.21% when all languages are taken
into consideration (8.6% error reduction). We
measured the statistical signiﬁcance of these re-
sults by considering on one side the predictions
made by the best performing classiﬁer for one lan-
guage (i.e., English), and on the other side the
predictions made by the classiﬁer trained on the
multilingual space composed of all six languages.
Using a paired t-test, the improvement was found
to be signiﬁcant at p = 0.001. It is worth men-
tioning that both the subjective and the objective
precision measures increase to 75% when more
than 3 languages are considered, while the overall
recall level stays constant at 74%.

To verify that the improvement is due indeed
to the addition of multilingual features, and it is
not a characteristic of the classiﬁer, we also tested
two other classiﬁers, namely KNN and Rocchio.
Figure 1 shows the average macro-accuracies ob-
tained with these classiﬁers. For all the classi-
ﬁers, the accuracies of the multilingual combina-
tions exhibit an increasing trend, as a larger num-
ber of languages is used to predict the subjectivity
annotations. The Na¨ıve Bayes algorithm has the
best performance, and a relative error rate reduc-

languages (combinations of 6 taken one through
six)

tion in accuracy of 8.25% for the grouping formed
of six languages versus one, while KNN and Roc-
chio exhibit an error rate reduction of 5.82% and
9.45%, respectively. All of these reductions are
statistically signiﬁcant.

In order to assess how the proposed multilin-
gual expansion improves on the individual lan-
guage classiﬁers, we select one language at a time
to be the reference, and then compute the aver-
age accuracies of the Na¨ıve Bayes learner across
all the language groupings (from one through six)
that contain the language. The results from this
experiment are illustrated in Figure 2. The base-
line in this case is represented by the accuracy ob-
tained with a classiﬁer trained on only one lan-
guage (this corresponds to 1 on the X-axis). As
more languages are added to the feature space,
we notice a steady improvement in performance.
When the language of reference is Arabic, we ob-
tain an error reduction of 15.27%; 9.04% for Ro-

good recall level which could be used to gen-
erate subjectivity datasets in the target lan-
guages?
Since we showed that the inclusion of multilingual
information improves the performance of subjec-
tivity classiﬁers for all the languages involved, we
further explore how the classiﬁers’ predictions can
be combined in order to generate high-precision
subjectivity annotations. As shown in previous
work, a high-precision classiﬁer can be used to
automatically generate subjectivity annotated data
(Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). Additionally, the data
annotated with a high-precision classiﬁer can be
used as a seed for bootstrapping methods, to fur-
ther enrich each language individually.

We experiment with a majority vote meta-
classiﬁer, which combines the predictions of the
monolingual Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁers described in
Section 3. For a particular number of languages
(one through six), all possible combinations of
languages are considered. Each combination sug-
gests a prediction only if its component classiﬁers
agree, otherwise the system returns an ”unknown”
prediction. The averages are computed across all
the combinations featuring the same number of
languages, regardless of language identity.
The results are shown in Table 4.

The
macro precision and recall averaged across groups
formed using a given number of languages are
presented in Figure 3. If the average monolingual
classiﬁer has a precision of 74.07%, the precision
increases as more languages are considered, with
a maximum precision of 83.38% obtained when
the predictions of all six languages are consid-
ered (56.02% error reduction). It is interesting to
note that the highest precision meta-classiﬁer for
groups of two languages includes German, while
for groups with more than three languages, both
Arabic and German are always present in the top
performing combinations. English only appears
in the highest precision combination for one, ﬁve
and six languages, indicating the fact that the pre-
dictions based on Arabic and German are more
robust.

We further analyze the behavior of each lan-
guage considering only those meta-classiﬁers that
include the given language. As seen in Figure 4,
all languages experience a boost in performance

manian; 7.80% for German; 6.44% for French;
6.06% for Spanish; and 4.90 % for English. Even
if the improvements seem minor, they are consis-
tent, and the use of a multilingual feature set en-
ables every language to reach a higher accuracy
than individually attainable.

In terms of the best classiﬁers obtained for
each grouping of one through six, English pro-
vides the best accuracy among individual clas-
siﬁers (74.71%). When considering all possible
combinations of six classiﬁers taken two, German
and Spanish provide the best results, at 75.67%.
Upon considering an additional language to the
mix, the addition of Romanian to the German-
Spanish classiﬁer further improves the accuracy
to 76.06%. Next, the addition of Arabic results
in the best performing overall classiﬁer, with an
accuracy of 76.22%. Upon adding supplemental
languages, such as English or French, no further
improvements are obtained. We believe this is
the case because German and Spanish are able to
expand the dimensionality conferred by English
alone, while at the same time generating a more
orthogonal space. Incrementally, Romanian and
Arabic are able to provide high quality features
for the classiﬁcation task. This behavior suggests
that languages that are somewhat further apart are
more useful for multilingual subjectivity classiﬁ-
cation than intermediary languages.

bic gains an absolute 11.0% in average precision
when considering votes from all languages, as
compared to the 72.30% baseline consisting of the
precision of the classiﬁer using only monolingual
features; this represents an error reduction in pre-
cision of 66.71%. The other languages experi-
ence a similar boost, including English which ex-
hibits an error reduction of 50.75% compared to
the baseline. Despite the fact that with each lan-
guage that is added to the meta-classiﬁer, the re-
call decreases, even when considering votes from
all six languages, the recall is still reasonably high
at 53.76%.

The results presented in table 4 are promis-
ing, as they are comparable to the ones obtained
in previous work. Compared to (Wiebe et al.,
2005), who used a high-precision rule-based clas-
siﬁer on the English MPQA corpus (see Table 1),
our method has a precision smaller by 3.32%, but
a recall larger by 21.16%. Additionally, unlike

(Wiebe et al., 2005), which requires language-
speciﬁc rules, making it applicable only to En-
glish, our method can be used to construct a high-
precision classiﬁer in any language that can be
connected to English via machine translation.

6 Related Work

Recently, resources and tools for sentiment anal-
ysis developed for English have been used as
a starting point to build resources in other lan-
guages, via cross-lingual projections or mono-
lingual and multi-lingual bootstrapping. Several
directions were followed, focused on leveraging
annotation schemes,
lexica, corpora and auto-
mated annotation systems. The English annota-
tion scheme developed by (Wiebe et al., 2005)
for opinionated text lays the groundwork for the
research carried out by (Esuli et al., 2008) when
annotating expressions of private state in the Ital-
ian Content Annotation Bank. Sentiment and

the OpinionFinder distribution (Wiebe and Riloff,
2005), the General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1967), or
the SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b)
were transfered into Chinese (Ku et al., 2006; Wu,
2008) and into Romanian (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
English corpora manually annotated for subjec-
tivity or sentiment such as MPQA (Wiebe et al.,
2005), or the multi-domain sentiment classiﬁca-
tion corpus (Blitzer et al., 2007) were subjected
to experiments in Spanish, Romanian, or Chinese
upon automatic translation by (Banea et al., 2008;
Wan, 2009). Furthermore, tools developed for En-
glish were used to determine sentiment or sub-
jectivity labeling for a given target language by
transferring the text to English and applying an
English classiﬁer on the resulting data. The labels
were then transfered back into the target language
(Bautin et al., 2008; Banea et al., 2008). These ex-
periments are carried out in Arabic, Chinese, En-
glish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Spanish, and Romanian.

The work closest to ours is the one proposed
by (Wan, 2009), who constructs a polarity co-
training system by using the multi-lingual views
obtained through the automatic translation of
product-reviews into Chinese and English. While
this work proves that leveraging cross-lingual in-
formation improves sentiment analysis in Chinese
over what could be achieved using monolingual
resources alone, there are several major differ-
ences with respect to the approach we are propos-
ing here. First, our training set is based solely
on the automatic translation of the English corpus.
We do not require an in-domain dataset available
in the target language that would be needed for
the co-training approach. Our method is therefore
transferable to any language that has an English-to
target language translation engine. Further, we fo-
cus on using multi-lingual data from six languages
to show that the results are reliable and replicable
across each language and that multiple languages
aid not only in conducting subjectivity research in
the target language, but also in improving the ac-
curacy in the source language as well. Finally,
while (Wan, 2009) research focuses on polarity
detection based on reviews, our work seeks to de-
termine sentence-level subjectivity from raw text.

7 Conclusion

Our results suggest that including multilingual
information when modeling subjectivity can not
only extrapolate current resources available for
English into other languages, but can also improve
subjectivity classiﬁcation in the source language
itself. We showed that we can improve an English
classiﬁer by using out-of-language features, thus
achieving a 4.90% error reduction in accuracy
with respect to using English alone. Moreover, we
also showed that languages other than English can
achieve an F-measure in subjectivity annotation
of over 75%, without using any manually crafted
resources for these languages. Furthermore, by
combining the predictions made by monolingual
classiﬁers using a majority vote learner, we are
able to generate sentence-level subjectivity anno-
tated data with a precision of 83% and a recall
level above 50%. Such high-precision classiﬁers
may be later used not only to create subjectivity-
annotated data in the target language, but also to
generate the seeds needed to sustain a language-
speciﬁc bootstrapping.

To conclude and provide an answer to the ques-
tion formulated in the title, more languages are
better, as they are able to complement each other,
and together they provide better classiﬁcation re-
sults. When one language cannot provide sufﬁ-
cient information, another one can come to the
rescue.
