Abstract

In this paper we discuss our participation to
the 2013 Semeval Semantic Textual Similarity
task. Our core features include (i) a set of met-
rics borrowed from automatic machine trans-
lation, originally intended to evaluate auto-
matic against reference translations and (ii) an
instance of explicit semantic analysis, built
upon opening paragraphs of Wikipedia 2010
articles. Our similarity estimator relies on a
support vector regressor with RBF kernel. Our
best approach required 13 machine transla-
tion metrics + explicit semantic analysis and
ranked 65 in the competition. Our post-
competition analysis shows that the features
have a good expression level, but overfitting
and —mainly— normalization issues caused
our correlation values to decrease.

1 Introduction

Our participation to the 2013 Semantic Textual Sim-
ilarity task (STS) (Agirre et al., 2013)1 was focused
on the CORE problem: GIVEN TWO SENTENCES,
s1 AND s2, QUANTIFIABLY INFORM ON HOW SIMI-
LAR s1 AND s2 ARE. We considered real-valued fea-
tures from four different sources: (i) a set of linguis-
tic measures computed with the Asiya Toolkit for
Automatic MT Evaluation (Giménez and Màrquez,
2010b), (ii) an instance of explicit semantic analy-
sis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), built on top
of Wikipedia articles, (iii) a dataset predictor, and
(iv) a subset of the features available in Takelab’s
Semantic Text Similarity system (Šarić et al., 2012).

Our approaches obtained an overall modest result
compared to other participants (best position: 65 out
of 89). Nevertheless, our post-competition analysis
shows that the low correlation was caused mainly by
a deficient data normalization strategy.

The paper distribution is as follows. Section 2 of-
fers a brief overview of the task. Section 3 describes
our approach. Section 4 discuss our experiments and
obtained results. Section 5 provides conclusions.

2 Task Overview

Detecting two similar text fragments is a difficult
task in cases where the similarity occurs at seman-
tic level, independently of the implied lexicon (e.g
in cases of dense paraphrasing). As a result, simi-
larity estimation models must involve features other
than surface aspects. The STS task is proposed as
a challenge focused in short English texts of dif-
ferent nature: from automatic machine translation
alternatives to human descriptions of short videos.
The test partition also included texts extracted from
news headlines and FrameNet–Wordnet pairs.

The range of similarity was defined between 0
(no relation) up to 5 (semantic equivalence). The
gold standard values were averaged from different
human-made annotations. The expected system’s
output was composed of a real similarity value, to-
gether with an optional confidence level (our confi-
dence level was set constant).

Table 1 gives an overview of the development
(2012 training and test) and test datasets. Note
that both collections extracted from SMT data are
highly biased towards the maximum similarity val-
ues (more than 75% of the instances have a similar-

On the other hand, the FNWN instances are shifted
towards low similarity levels (more than 60% have a
similarity lower than 2).

3 Approach

Our similarity assessment model relies upon
SVMlight’s support vector regressor, with RBF ker-
nel (Joachims, 1999).2 Our model estimation pro-
cedure consisted of two steps: parameter defini-
tion and backward elimination-based feature selec-
tion. The considered features belong to four fami-
lies, briefly described in the following subsections.

3.1 Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics

We consider a set of linguistic measures originally
intended to evaluate the quality of automatic trans-
lation systems. These measures compute the quality
of a translation by comparing it against one or sev-
eral reference translations, considered as gold stan-
dard. A straightforward application of these mea-
sures to the problem at hand is to consider s1 as the
reference and s2 as the automatic translation, or vice
versa. Some of the metrics are not symmetric so we
compute similarity between s1 and s2 in both direc-
tions and average the resulting scores.

The measures are computed with the Asiya
Toolkit for Automatic MT Evaluation (Giménez and
Màrquez, 2010b). The only pre-processing carried
out was tokenization (Asiya performs additional in-
box pre-processing operations, though). We consid-

2We also tried with linear kernels, but RBF always obtained
better results.

ered a sample from three similarity families, which
was proposed in (Giménez and Màrquez, 2010a) as
a varied and robust metric set, showing good corre-
lation with human assessments.3

Lexical Similarity Two metrics of Translation
Error Rate (Snover et al., 2006) (i.e. the esti-
mated human effort to convert s1 into s2): -TER
and -TERpA. Two measures of lexical precision:
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Dod-
dington, 2002). One measure of lexical recall:
ROUGEW (Lin and Och, 2004). Finally, four vari-
ants of METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) (exact,
stemming, synonyms, and paraphrasing), a lexical
metric accounting for F -Measure.

Syntactic Similarity Three metrics that estimate
the similarity of the sentences over dependency
parse trees (Liu and Gildea, 2005): DP-HWCMic-4
for grammatical categories chains, DP-HWCMir-4
over grammatical relations, and DP-Or(⋆) over
words ruled by non-terminal nodes. Also, one mea-
sure that estimates the similarity over constituent
parse trees: CP-STM4 (Liu and Gildea, 2005).

Semantic Similarity Three measures that esti-
mate the similarities over semantic roles (i.e. ar-
guments and adjuncts): SR-Or, SR-Mr(⋆), and
SR-Or(⋆). Additionally, two metrics that es-
timate similarities over discourse representations:
DR-Or(⋆) and DR-Orp(⋆).

nical Manual v2.0, pp. 15–21.

3.2 Explicit Semantic Analysis

We built an instance of Explicit Semantic Analy-
sis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) with
the first paragraph of 100k Wikipedia articles (dump
from 2010).Pre-processing consisted of tokenization
and lemmatization.

3.3 Dataset Prediction

Given the similarity shifts in the different datasets
(cf. Table 1), we tried to predict what dataset an in-
stance belonged to on the basis of its vocabulary. We
built binary maxent classifiers for each dataset in the
development set, resulting in five dataset likelihood
features: dMSRpar, dSMTeuroparl, dMSRvid,
dOnWN, and dSMTnews.4 Pre-processing consisted
of tokenization and lemmatization.

3.4 Baseline

We considered the features included in the Takelab
Semantic Text Similarity system (Šarić et al., 2012),
one of the top-systems in last year competition. This
system is used as a black box. The resulting features
are named tklab n, where n = [1, 21].

Our runs departed from three increasing subsets
of features: AE machine translation evaluation met-
rics and explicit semantic analysis, AED the pre-
vious set plus dataset prediction, and AED T the
previous set plus Takelab’s baseline features (cf. Ta-
ble 3). We performed a feature normalization, which
relied on the different feature’s distribution over the
entire dataset. Firstly, features were bounded in the
range µ±3∗σ2 in order to reduce the potentially neg-
ative impact of outliers. Secondly, we normalized
according to the z-score (Nardo et al., 2008, pp. 28,
84); i.e. x = (x − µ)/σ. As a result, each real-
valued feature distribution in the dataset has µ = 0
and σ = 1. During the model tuning stage we tried
with other numerous normalization options: normal-
izing each dataset independently, together with the
training set, and without normalization at all. Nor-
malizing according to the entire dev-test dataset led
to the best results

4 Experiments and Results

Section 4.1 describes our model tuning strategy.
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 discuss the official and post-
competition results.

4.1 Model Tuning

We used only the dev-train partition (2012 training)
for tuning. By means of a 10-fold cross validation
process, we defined the trade-off (c), gamma (γ),
and tube width (ǫ) parameters for the regressor and
performed a backward-elimination feature selection
process (Witten and Frank, 2005, p. 294), indepen-
dently for the three experiments.

The results for the cross-validation process are
summarized in Table 2. The three runs allow for cor-
relations higher than 0.8. On the one hand, the best
regressor parameters obtain better results as more
features are considered, still with very small differ-
ences. On the other hand, the low correlation in-
crease after the feature selection step shows that a
few features are indeed irrelevant.

A summary of the features considered in each ex-
periment (also after feature selection) is displayed in
Table 3. The correlation obtained over the dev-test
partition are corrAE = 0.7269, corrAED = 0.7638,
and corrAEDT = 0.8044 —it would have appeared
in the top-10 ranking of the 2012 competition.

4.2 Official Results

We trained three new regressors with the features
considered relevant by the tuning process, but using
the entire development dataset. The test 2013 parti-
tion was normalized again by means of z-score, con-
sidering the means and standard deviations of the en-
tire test dataset. Table 4 displays the official results.
Our best approach —AE—, was positioned in rank
65. The worst results of run AED can be explained
by the difference in the nature of the test respect to

the development dataset. AED T obtains worst re-
sults than AE on the headlines and SMT datasets.
The reason behind this behavior can be in the dif-
ference of vocabularies respect to that stored in the
Takelab system (it includes only the vocabulary of
the development partition). This could be the same
reason behind the drop in performance with respect
to the results previously obtained on the dev-test par-
tition (cf. Section 4.1).

4.3 Post-Competition Results

Our analysis of the official results showed the main
issue was normalization. Thus, we performed a
manifold of new experiments, using the same con-
figuration as in run AE, but applying other normal-
ization strategies: (a) z-score normalization, but ig-
noring the FNWN dataset (given its shift through
low values); (b) z-score normalization, but consid-
ering independent means and standard deviations for
each test dataset; and (c) without normalizing any of
dataset (including the regressor one).

Table 5 includes the results. (a) makes evident
that the instances in FNWN represent “anomalies”
that harm the normalized values of the rest of sub-
sets. Run (b) shows that normalizing the test sets

AE (c) 0.6590 0.6973 0.1547 0.3429 0.5208

independently is not a good option, as the regressor
is trained considering overall normalizations, which
explains the correlation decrease. Run (c) is com-
pletely different: not normalizing any dataset —
both in development and test— reduces the influ-
ence of the datasets to each other and allows for the
best results. Indeed, this configuration would have
advanced practically forty positions at competition
time, locating us in rank 27.

Estimating the adequate similarities over FNWN
seems particularly difficult for our systems. We ob-
serve two main factors. (i) FNWN presents an im-
portant similarity shift respect to the other datasets:
nearly 90% of the instances similarity is lower than
2.5 and (ii) the average lengths of s1 and s2 are very
different: 30 vs 9 words. These characteristics made
it difficult for our MT evaluation metrics to estimate
proper similarity values (be normalized or not).

We performed two more experiments over
FNWN: training regressors with ESA as the only
feature, before and after normalization. The correla-
tion was 0.16017 and 0.3113, respectively. That is,
the normalization mainly affects the MT features.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we discussed on our participation to the
2013 Semeval Semantic Textual Similarity task. Our
approach relied mainly upon a combination of au-
tomatic machine translation evaluation metrics and
explicit semantic analysis. Building an RBF support
vector regressor with these features allowed us for a
modest result in the competition (our best run was
ranked 65 out of 89).
