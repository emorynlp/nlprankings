Abstract 

Corpus resources with complex linguistic annotations are becoming increasingly important in 

the work of language specialists. They often need to perform extensive corpus research, in-

cluding Natural Language Processing (NLP), statistical modelling and data visualisation. Our 

software system, called Trameur, aims at making these analyses possible within a single graph-

ical user interface. It relies upon a specific data modelling framework presented in this paper. 

1 Introduction 

Treebanks, or parsed text corpora that annotate syntactic or semantic sentence structure, are widely 

appreciated in language studies. These corpora are getting more and more complex and consist of sev-

eral layers of annotations. Such multifaceted data collections present many challenges for the devel-

opment of specific NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools, statistical modelling and data visualisa-

tion techniques. In terms of statistical text analysis, most research has been carried out using either 

unannotated texts or tagged texts, annotated with parts of speech only (Lebart et al., 1998). As for cor-

pora with richer annotations such as clauses, grammatical functions and dependency links, recent re-

search projects have been focused on the development of treebank querying methods with fast search 

algorithms (Cunningham et al., 2002; Mírovský and Ondruška, 2002; Götze and Dipper, 2006). How-

ever, for annotated corpus analysis, it is often necessary to precisely locate different types of linguistic 

schemes under study, with simultaneous access to multiple corpus layers and their interactions statis-

tics. 

To face these challenges, we develop an integrated system for statistical analysis of annotated text 

data called Trameur (Fleury, 2013a). Trameur manages multiple layers of linguistic annotations and 

allows statistical exploration of complex linguistic features and embedded dependency relations. Addi-

tionally, Trameur incorporates advanced NLP processing and text mapping features. This framework 

has been developed to allow multiple corpus analyses within a single graphical user interface, accessi-

ble to any corpus linguist, without extensive programing skills and knowledge of statistical modelling 

tools. 

2 Corpus research with Trameur 

Trameur was successfully tested for monolingual text processing within several research projects in 

corpus linguistics and discourse analysis (Branca-Rosoff et al., 2012; Née et al., 2012). On-going re-

search demonstrates its potential for processing parallel and comparable text data in distant languages 

(Zimina and Fleury, 2014).

2.1 Data structures for annotated text processing 

Several software packages dedicated to multi-level text processing apply pipeline architecture to sup-

port reproducible analyses of text annotations stored in specific formats (Eberle et al., 2012; Eckart et 

al., 2012). We provide here a description of the specific data structures used by Trameur (text segmen-

tation, partition, statistical tables, etc.) to implement incremental textual resources for treebanks. 

In Trameur, a formal representation of text segmentation relies upon two systems of units: text con-

tainers and contents (or items) (Fleury, 2013a). Text containers reflect the structure of different corpus 

parts, while contents represent systems of textual units (lexemes, graphemes, etc.) and their frequency 

variations which can be examined on a statistical basis. Based on computerized procedures, the sys-

tems of containers and contents allow automatic counts in the form of large statistical tables. These 

tables can be further processed by quantitative methods to detect salient points of statistical distribu-

tion in the corpus and build the premises of variation analysis. 

Containers and contents are essential elements of double-tracking text segmentation process: 

 (1) Cutting text into containers (parts, textual zones, sections, chapters, paragraphs, sentences, etc.) 

allows creating a system of text spans that can be further compared on a quantitative basis. (2) Text 

segmentation into items (or contents) isolates distinct textual units within a text corpus. This text seg-

mentation is closely interconnected with the other two operations: annotation of items (attributing a 

distinct tag, such as lemma or grammatical category, to each isolated item), and typing of isolated 

items (judged similar because of their intrinsic nature or on the basis of corpus annotations). Thus, 

each segmented text is a succession of isolated items that can always be reunited to restore the initial 

text sequence. Each item is further attached to a given type. 

After text segmentation in Trameur, the items are numbered to create a system of coordinates, 

where each item is spotted by its corresponding sequence number. In Trameur, this system is called 

Thread (in French: trame). The same system of coordinates is used to define and locate text spans (or 

textual zones) formed by a series of consecutive items between positions x1 and x2, or by a certain 

number of textual zones of this type. The definition of a Thread allows describing various systems of 

textual zones corresponding to the text containers (corpus parts, sections, chapters, paragraphs, sen-

tences, etc.). The descriptions of the containers are united within a specific data structure called 

Frame. 

The Thread/Frame structure allows defining Selection as any object corresponding to the selected 

subset of Thread items used in the corpus exploration. There are several types of Selection: (1) Selec-

tion corresponding to the contents (certain Thread items, such as occurrences of the same token, lem-

ma, or items corresponding to the same regular expression operated on one or several annotation lev-

els); (2) Selection corresponding to certain containers (textual zones, paragraphs, sections, etc.) com-

posed of contiguous item sequences, selected according to their positions in the text; (3) Selection re-

sulting from highlighting operations performed by a human expert on the basis of some complex crite-

ria, possibly difficult to describe on a formal basis; (4) A textual zone discovered following the results 

of a statistical calculation; (5) A sub-set of textual units selected following a statistical calculation that 

highlights a specific distribution of items (contents) within a corpus. 

The following demonstration of these principles is based on a data sample from the Rhapsodie cor-

pus of spoken French annotated for prosody and syntax (Gerdes et al., 2012). The data file is available 

online in tabular form and can be displayed in a spreadsheet.

 The data set used in this demonstration 

comes from Rhapsodie v1 micro-syntax annotations. This first release is limited to 13 annotations.

The corpus data is structured as follows: all Rhapsodie texts are first identified by codes (column 1). 

Each text is further divided into separate units (column 2) and segmented into tokens (column 3). The 

remaining columns display linguistic annotations of the tokens, including microsyntax (rection, de-

pendency and constituancy) (Fleury, 2013b). 

Figure 1 shows the Rhapsodie data set transformed from the spreadsheet format into a Trameur base 

file using regular expressions. The data structure is composed of two parts: (1) a Thread, which is a list 

of items with position identifiers; (2) a Frame, which is a list of corpus partitions defined on the 

Thread. Each partition has a name and a list of named constituents identified through their first and

 Rhapsodie v3 is the latest online release with micro-syntax, macro-syntax and prosody annotations. It is cur-

rently under study in a number of on-going research projects that will be revealed in forthcoming publications.

last token positions on the Thread. Thus, each annotated token from the Rhapsodie corpus becomes an 

item identified by its position on the Thread. 

Dependency relations among items are annotated as follows: RELATION(TARGET), where: RE-

LATION is a character string corresponding to the name of the relation; TARGET is a numerical val-

ue of the position identifier on the Thread (see Figure 1). All linguistic annotations from the Rhapso-

die sample file are preserved in the Trameur base file. These annotations can be displayed and edited 

in the graphical user interface (see Figure 2): a-00001:Token, a-00002 Lemma, a-00003 P.O.S, a-

00004 Mode, a-00005 Tense, a-00006 Person, a-00007 Number, a-00008 Gender, a-00009 

Type_rection(Gov_rection), a-00010 Type_para(Gov_para), a-00011 Type_inher(Gov_inher), a-

00012 Type_junc(Gov_junc), a-00013 Type_junc-inher(Gov_junc-inher).

2.2 Exploration of dependency relations 

 
Figure 2: Trameur. Graph of a double dependency relation. 

 

Dependency relations emerging from linguistic annotations can be explored, filtered and displayed 

using dependency graphs, text maps with context return, concordances, co-occurrence statistics, etc. 

All these features with related screenshots are presented in the on-line user guide.

Figure 2 displays a sample graph of a double dependency relation from Rhapsodie. It is set by the 

regular expression OBJ|SUB (OBJ or SUB), where the relation target for the lemma is “aimer” and 

the annotation n°9 Type_rection(Gov_rection) is ROOT. For each item in context, a pop-up window 

displays all annotation levels with corresponding tags (or “no tag” signs <─>) and their frequencies 

(Freq) on a given annotation level. 

Figure 3 displays the nodes of the same graph in a concordance window. A selection tool is used to 

highlight annotation n°3 in concordance lines (value = B_adv).

3 Conclusion 

Trameur is a tool for exploration of complex multi-layer linguistic corpora with different annotations. 

It is built upon a Thread/Frame data model using XML. The software is distributed with a graphical 

user interface. A reference package for Windows is available for free download from the official web-

site: http://www.tal.univ-paris3.fr/trameur.

. However, the novelty of Trameur consists in expanding a multi-

layered data model to all stages of corpus exploration, including text mapping features and statistical 

analysis of dependency relations within a single graphical user interface. 

Following this integrated approach, Trameur can be used, for example, to build complex linguistic 

units, analyse their dependency relations and reveal their characteristic attractions using text statistics. 

In Trameur, quantitative analyses are applied to textual resources, built upon a Thread and an evolu-

tionary Frame. These analyses can progressively enrich these resources with new text divisions or an-

notations, without deleting previous information. Following this approach, it becomes possible to im-

plement incremental textual resources for treebanks. 

It is the use of the Thread/Frame data model implemented in Trameur that allows different combi-

nations of analyses when processing multifaceted linguistic annotations. We believe that this evolu-

tionary framework offers new perspectives for corpus research.
