Abstract

We consider a novel setting for Named En-
tity Recognition (NER) where we have ac-
cess to document-specific knowledge base
tags. These tags consist of a canonical
name from a knowledge base (KB) and en-
tity type, but are not aligned to the text.
We explore how to use KB tags to cre-
ate document-specific gazetteers at infer-
ence time to improve NER. We find that
this kind of supervision helps recognise
organisations more than standard wide-
coverage gazetteers. Moreover, augment-
ing document-specific gazetteers with KB
information lets users specify fewer tags
for the same performance, reducing cost.

1 Introduction

NER is the task of identifying names in text and
assigning them a type (e.g. person, location, or-
ganisation, miscellaneous). State-of-the-art super-
vised approaches use models that incorporate a
name’s form, its linguistic context and its com-
patibility with known names. These models rely
on large manually-annotated corpora, specifying
name spans and types. These are vital for training
models, but it is laborious and expensive to label
every occurrence of a name in a document.

We consider a non-standard setting where, for
each document, we have metadata in the form of
document-specific knowledge base tags. A KB tag
is a canonical name, that is an identifier in a KB
(e.g. a Wikipedia title), and an entity type. While
these tags have a correct type assigned for at least
one context, they are not aligned to phrases in the
text, and may not share the same form as all of
their mentions (e.g. we may see the tag United
Nations for the mention UN). We also assume
that each tag matches at least one mention in the
document, but do not specify where in the docu-
ment the mention is.

There are many sources of KB tags, such as
manual entity indexing for news stories or data ex-
tracted from personalised knowledge stores. For
example, the New York Times Annotated Corpus
(Sandhaus, 2008) contains more than 1.5M arti-
cles “manually tagged by library scientists with
tags drawn from a normalized indexing vocabu-
lary of people, organizations, locations and topic
descriptors”. Names and types are also present
in large quantities of financial news stories from
Bloomberg (Bradesko et al., 2015), in the form of
linked names of companies and people.

Document-level tags may be quicker for anno-
tators to apply than the usual method of marking
spans in text, and are thus a cheap form of supervi-
sion. It is hard to make strong comparisons to the
standard NER task, as KB tags can be considered
partial, unaligned gold-standard supervision – so
fully supervised models should perform better, the
question is by how much and why.

This paper explores effective ways to use KB
tags for improving NER. We use the CoNLL
2003 English NER dataset (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003), annotated with Wikipedia
links (Hoffart et al., 2011). This allows us to sim-
ulate a set of KB tags for each document in the
TRAIN, TESTA and TESTB splits of the dataset. We
use a document’s KB tags to build a document-
specific gazetteers which we use in addition to
standard features for a conditional random field
(CRF) model (Lafferty et al., 2001).

We compare against wide-coverage gazetteers,
which score 89.85% F-score on TESTA. Assum-
ing access to all possible KB tags, the upper bound
for KB tag models is substantially better at 92.85%
F-score. KB tags help NER accuracy across all
entity types, but provide relatively better supervi-
sion for organisation entities than wide-coverage
gazetteers. The benefit of KB tags comes from
their type information, which is required for good
performance. We also examine how performance

degrades as we use fewer KB tags, simulating the
use-case where a busy knowledge worker spends
less time annotating. We find that KB augmenta-
tion means we require fewer tags to reach the same
performance, which reduces the cost of obtaining
KB tags. We show how KB tags can be exploited
as a useful complement to traditional NER super-
vision.

2 Background

Gazetteers have long been used to augment statis-
tical NER models, adding general evidence of to-
kens used in names (Nadeau and Sekine, 2007).
These are usually drawn from wide-coverage
sources like Wikipedia and census lists (Ratinov
and Roth, 2009) and can be incorporated into se-
quence models by designing binary features that
indicate whether a token appears in a gazetteer en-
try. Features can be refined by specifying which
part of an entry a token matches using tag en-
coding schemes such as IOB (Kazama and Tori-
sawa, 2007). Using multiple gazetteers allows fea-
ture weights to capture different name types and
sources. Given their purpose to increase coverage
beyond names included in training data, gazetteers
are usually large, general and static, remaining the
same during training and prediction time.

Beyond their use as sources for gazetteers, the
link structure in and around KBs has been used to
create training data. A prominent technique is to
follow links back from KB articles to documents
that mention the subject of the article, heuristically
labelling high-precision matches to create training
data. This has been used for genetic KBs (Mor-
gan et al., 2003; Vlachos and Gasperin, 2006), and
Wikipedia (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Rich-
man and Schone, 2008; Nothman et al., 2013).
These works do not consider our setting where
gold-standard entities are given at inference time
as their goal is to generate training data.

KBs have also been used to help other natural
language processing tasks such as coreference res-
olution (Rahman and Ng, 2011), topic modelling
(Kataria et al., 2011) and named entity linking
(Cucerzan, 2007; Ratinov et al., 2011). Finally,
it may be that supervised data is only available
in some circumstances, for example in the case
of personalising NER models. Jung et al. (2015)
query a user’s smartphone data services to create
user-specific gazetteers of personal information.
The background NER model is initially trained

without access to the user-specific information and
later adapted on the users’s smartphone.

3 Document-level KB tags

We incorporate information from KB tags by
building document-specific gazetteers. Figure 1
shows an example with a document in which the
names need to be recognised and typed (in square
brackets). We are also given a list of KB tags,
each of which is a canonical name and a type.
These are linked to a KB which we use to ex-
tract aliases, in our case each canonical name is
a Wikipedia article, and redirects to that article are
considered aliases. Our goal is that knowing that
a document mentions the entity West Indies
cricket team can help us identify Windies or
Calypso Cavaliers.

To create gazetteers from a document’s KB
tags, we preprocess the canonical name from
each KB tag, tokenising by underscore, lower-
casing and removing parenthesised suffixes (e.g.
Chris Lewis (cricketer) becomes chris
lewis). We use an encoding scheme to incorpo-
rate the type information from the KB tag. In-
spired by Kazama and Torisawa (2007), who ap-
plied IOB encoding to gazetteers, we apply the
BMEOW (a.k.a. BILOU), a scheme that also distin-
guishes between beginning, middle, end, outside

513



and single word positions.1 For example, this al-
lows us to map chris lewis to B-PER E-PER,
and we can aggregate gazetteers of tokens for each
encoded type, such that the gazetteer for B-PER
contains chris.

Our CRF gazetteer features are calculated from
an input token from the text that we wish to label.
Having created a document’s KB tag gazetteers,
we can define binary features that are active if
an input token matches (case-insensitively) with a
particular gazetteer. This models both the part of
the KB tag name that the token matched, and its
type. The input token Chris thus activates the fea-
ture fB-PER and the token cricket would activate
the fI-MISC and fI-ORG, as it matches inside
entries of the two types.

4 Methodology

We define several configurations to investigate KB
tags. The first four baselines either do not use KB
tags, or do not integrate them into the CRF. The
second four configurations use KB tag features in
the CRF model.

4.1 Baselines

KB tag matching (MATCH) We find the longest
full match from the document gazetteer and apply
the known type. This will not match partial or non-
canonical names, but should be high-precision.
This is similar to the CoNLL 2003 baseline sys-
tem (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

Baseline (CRF) We train a CRF model using
CRFsuite (Okazaki, 2007) with a standard set
of features that encode lexical context, token
shape, but no external knowledge features such as
gazetteers. All following configurations build on
the CRF with standard features.

KB tag repair (CRF+REPAIR) We label the text
using the baseline CRF, then find the longest full
match from the document gazetteer and assign the
known type. When a gazetteer match overlaps
with a CRF match, we prefer the gazetteer and re-
move the latter. Although we do not consider par-
tial matches, this may recognise longer names that
can be difficult for CRF models.

Wide-coverage gazetteers (CRF+WIDE) This
uses gazetteers distributed with the Illinois NER
system (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). We encode each

phrase using the BMEOW scheme described above,
and use the filename of each gazetteer as its type.
There are 33 gazetteers drawn from many sources
with approximately 2 million entries.

4.2 Using KB tags as CRF features
KB tag names (CRF+NAME) We generate
document-specific gazetteer features, but use the
same type for each entry.

KB tag names and types (CRF+NAME+TYPE)
This is equivalent to CRF+NAME, but includes
known types. Since type varies with context, this
may not be correct, but is hopefully informative.

KB tag names, types and KB aliases
(CRF+NAME+TYPE+AKA) This builds on
the above, but uses the KB to augment the
document-specific gazetteer with known aliases
of the KB tags, for example adding UN for
United Nations with the known type.

KB tag names, types, KB aliases and large
gazetteers (CRF+NAME+TYPE+AKA+WIDE) This
combines all KB tag features with the wide-
coverage gazetteers.

We fetch and cache KB information using a
Wikipedia API client.2 We assume the tag set of
person (PER), organisation (ORG), location (LOC)
and miscellaneous (MISC), and report precision,
recall and F-score from the conlleval evalu-
ation script. The median proportion of mentions
in a document that are linked to the KB is 81% in
TRAIN and TESTB, and 85% in TESTA. Augment-
ing the gazetteer with aliases produces, on aver-
age, 26 times the number of gazetteer entries than
KB tags alone in TESTA, and 23 times in TESTB.

5 Results

Table 1 shows the performance of different con-
figurations – we focus first on TESTA overall F-
scores. Matching against KB tag names results
in high-precision but low recall with an F-score
of 55.35%, far worse than the baseline CRF at
87.68%. Despite its naı̈ve assumptions, repair-
ing the CRF tags using longest matches in the
document gazetteer performs surprisingly well at
89.76%, just lower than using wide coverage
gazetteers, with an F-score of 89.85%.

The first setting that uses KB tags as CRF fea-
tures is CRF+NAME, which includes typeless names

and has an F-score of 89.29%. Precision and
recall are lower than wide coverage gazetteers,
suggesting that, without type information, big-
ger gazetteers are better. Adding type features
(CRF+NAME+TYPE) results in better performance
than either CRF or CRF+WIDE at 92.7% F-score.3

Augmenting the document gazetteers using aliases
from the KB further improves F-score for aliases
(92.85%). Adding wide-coverage gazetteers to KB
tags slightly decreases F-score at 92.57%. These
results indicate that type information is critical
and, to confirm this, we ran experiments that used
only name and alias information from KB tags.
This scores 89.45% F-score on TESTA and 83.62%
F-score on TESTB. While aliases help, type infor-
mation is required to improve performance beyond
wide coverage gazetteers.

To give some insight into why KB tag types
are effective, consider the name West Indian.

coverage gazetteers, including those that also con-
tain people, locations, organisations, songs. A
document-specific gazetteer is able to constrain
this type ambiguity, producing a cleaner signal
for the model. Aliases, on the other hand, allow
the model to capture non-canonical variants of a
name, but this depends on type information for
good NER performance.

We also examine the per-tag F-scores for
TESTA to investigate whether KB tags help some
types of entities more than others. Using
CRF+NAME+TYPE+AKA we obtain around 95.5%
F-score for PER and LOC entities. As with
CRF+WIDE, MISC entities remain hard to tag cor-
rectly. However, if we consider the percent-
age F-score gain by type over the CRF baseline,
CRF+WIDE gazetteers improve performance most
for PER (+2.94%), then ORG (2.77%) entities. The
top two are reversed for CRF+NAME+TYPE+AKA,
with ORG (+6.83%), then PER (+5.48%). This
suggests that KB tags are particularly well-suited
for helping recognise organisations names.

We see similar trends in TESTB, except KB tags
and CRF+WIDE are complementary. The experi-
ments illustrate that if we are lucky enough to have
KB tags, they improve NER. However, the models
use all possible KB tags and should be considered
an upper bound. To better model busy workers, we
restrict the gazetteers to only KB tags from men-
tions in the first n sentences. This matches asking
an annotator to only bother looking at the first n
sentences. Figure 2 shows how the KB tag models
perform on TESTA as we increase n. To achieve
better performance than CRF+WIDE, one should
view the first 5 sentences for CRF+NAME+TYPE.
Aliases (CRF+NAME+TYPE+AKA) reduce perfor-
mance slightly when only using a few sentences,
but with more than 4 sentences, aliases are consis-
tently useful. This trend is also apparent in TESTB,
showing that augmenting tags with KB informa-
tion improves NER, especially when only a few
tags are available.

6 Discussion and conclusion

There are several avenues to explore further. Ask-
ing annotators to specify types is not ideal and it
would be better to predict them from the KB. We
only use the KB to collect aliases, but we could
use it to harvest related entities. Another chal-
lenge is appropriately modelling the interaction
between a sentence-level task and document-level
constraints. A KB tag might match a mention in
one sentence and this should influence predictions
there. However, its evidence should be less im-
portant elsewhere since that constraint has already
been satisfied. This would improve robustness,
however global constraints are hard to model in
sentence-unit CRF models.

This paper presents a novel NER setting
whereby we have access to some number of KB
tags – canonical names and types – at training
and inference time. We explore how best to use
this information, finding that CRF models can in-
deed take advantage of this non-standard supervi-
sion. Moreover, models benefit from integration
with the KB, in our case augmenting document
gazetteers to maximise the benefit of KB tags.
