Abstract

This paper describes the structure of the LTH
coreference solver used in the closed track of
the CoNLL 2012 shared task (Pradhan et al.,
2012). The solver core is a mention classifier
that uses Soon et al. (2001)’s algorithm and
features extracted from the dependency graphs
of the sentences.

This system builds on Björkelund and Nugues
(2011)’s solver that we extended so that it can
be applied to the three languages of the task:
English, Chinese, and Arabic. We designed
a new mention detection module that removes
pleonastic pronouns, prunes constituents, and
recovers mentions when they do not match ex-
actly a noun phrase. We carefully redesigned
the features so that they reflect more com-
plex linguistic phenomena as well as discourse
properties. Finally, we introduced a minimal
cluster model grounded in the first mention of
an entity.

We optimized the feature sets for the three lan-
guages: We carried out an extensive evalua-
tion of pairs of features and we complemented
the single features with associations that im-
proved the CoNLL score. We obtained the re-
spective scores of 59.57, 56.62, and 48.25 on
English, Chinese, and Arabic on the develop-
ment set, 59.36, 56.85, and 49.43 on the test
set, and the combined official score of 55.21.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we present the LTH coreference solver
used in the closed track of the CoNLL 2012 shared
task (Pradhan et al., 2012). We started from an

earlier version of the system by Björkelund and
Nugues (2011), to which we added substantial im-
provements. As base learning and decoding algo-
rithm, our solver extracts noun phrases and posses-
sive pronouns and uses Soon et al. (2001)’s pairwise
classifier to decide if a pair corefers or not. Similarly
to the earlier LTH system, we constructed a primary
feature set from properties extracted from the depen-
dency graphs of the sentences.

2 System Architecture

The training and decoding modules consist of a
mention detector, a pair generator, and a feature ex-
tractor. The training module extracts a set of positive
and negative pairs of mentions and uses logistic re-
gression and the LIBLINEAR package (Fan et al.,
2008) to generate a binary classifier. The solver ex-
tracts pairs of mentions and uses the classifier and its
probability output, Pcoref (Antecedent, Anaphor), to
determine if a pair corefers or not. The solver has
also a post processing step to recover some mentions
that do not match a noun phrase constituent.

3 Converting Constituents to Dependency
Trees

Although the input to coreference solvers are pairs
or sets of constituents, many systems use concepts
from dependency grammars to decide if a pair is
coreferent. The most frequent one is the con-
stituent’s head that solvers need then to extract us-
ing ad-hoc rules; see the CoNLL 2011 shared task
(Pradhan et al., 2011), for instance. This can be te-
dious as we may have to write new rules for each
new feature to incorporate in the classifier. That is

64



why, instead of writing sets of rules applicable to
specific types of dependencies, we converted all the
constituents in the three corpora to generic depen-
dency graphs before starting the training and solving
steps. We used the LTH converter (Johansson and
Nugues, 2007) for English, the Penn2Malt converter
(Nivre, 2006) with the Chinese rules for Chinese1,
and the CATiB converter (Habash and Roth, 2009)
for Arabic.

The CATiB converter (Habash and Roth, 2009)
uses the Penn Arabic part-of-speech tagset, while
the automatically tagged version of the CoNLL Ara-
bic corpus uses a simplified tagset inspired by the
English version of the Penn treebank. We translated
these simplified POS tags to run the CATiB con-
verter. We created a lookup table to map the simpli-
fied POS tags in the automatically annotated corpus
to the Penn Arabic POS tags in the gold annotation.
We took the most frequent association in the lookup
table to carry out the translation. We then used the
result to convert the constituents into dependencies.
We translated the POS tags in the development set
using a dictionary extracted from the gold training
file and we translated the tags in the training file by a
5-fold cross-validation. We used this dictionary dur-
ing both training and classifying since our features
had a better performance with the Arabic tagset.

4 Mention Extraction

4.1 Base Extraction
As first step of the mention selection stage, we ex-
tracted all the noun phrases (NP), pronouns (PRP),
and possessive pronouns (PRP$) for English and
Arabic, with the addition of PN pronouns for Chi-
nese. This stage is aimed at reaching a high recall of
the mentions involved in the coreference chains and
results in an overinclusive set of candidates. Table 1
shows the precision and recall figures for the respec-
tive languages when extracting mentions from the
training set. The precision is significantly lower for
Arabic than for English and Chinese.

4.2 Removal of the Pleonastic it
In the English corpus, the pronoun it in the first step
of the mention extraction stage creates a high num-
ber of false positive mentions. We built a classifier

to discard as many of these pleonastic it as possible
from the mention list.

Table 2 shows the features we used to train the
classifier and Table 3 shows the impact on the final
system. We optimized the feature set using greedy
forward and backward selections. We explored var-
ious ways of using the classifier: before, after, and
during coreference resolving. We obtained the best
results when we applied the pleonastic classifier dur-
ing coreference solving and we multiplied the prob-
ability outputs from the two classifiers. We used the
inequality:

Pcoref (Antecedent, it)× (1− Ppleo(it)) > 0.4,

where we found the optimal threshold of 0.4 using a
5-fold cross-validation.

4.3 Named Entities
The simple rule to approximate entities to noun
phrases and pronouns leaves out between ∼8% and
∼13 % of the entities in the corpora (Table 1). As the
named entities sometimes do not match constituents,
we tried to add them to increase the recall. We
carried out extensive experiments for the three lan-

guages. While the named entities increased the score
for the English corpus, we found that it lowered
the results for Chinese and Arabic. We added all
single and multiword named entities of the English
corpus except the CARDINAL, ORDINAL, PER-
CENT, and QUANTITY tags. Table 1 shows the re-
call and precision for English and Table 4 shows the
named entity impact on the overall CoNLL score on
the development set.

4.4 Pruning

When constituents shared the same head in the list
of mentions, we pruned the smaller ones. This in-
creased the scores for English and Chinese, but low-
ered that of Arabic (Table 5). The results for the
latter language are somewhat paradoxical; they are
possibly due to errors in the dependency conversion.

5 Decoding

Depending on the languages, we applied different
decoding strategies: For Chinese and Arabic, we
used a closest-first clustering method as described
by Soon et al. (2001) for pronominal anaphors and
a best-first clustering otherwise as in Ng and Cardie

English Total score
Without extensions 57.22
With extensions 59.57

Table 6: Total impact of the extensions to the mention
extraction stage on the English development set.

(2002). For English, we applied a closest-first clus-
tering for pronominal anaphors. For nonpronomi-
nal anaphors, we used an averaged best-first cluster-
ing: We considered all the chains before the current
anaphor and we computed the geometric mean of the
pair probabilities using all the mentions in a chain.
We linked the anaphor to the maximal scoring chain
or we created a new chain if the score was less than
0.5. We discarded all the remaining singletons.

As in Björkelund and Nugues (2011), we recov-
ered some mentions using a post processing stage,
where we clustered named entities to chains having
strict matching heads.

6 Features

We started with the feature set described in
Björkelund and Nugues (2011) for our baseline sys-
tem for English and with the feature set in Soon et al.
(2001) for Chinese and Arabic. Due to space limita-
tions, we omit the description of these features and
refer to the respective papers.

6.1 Naming Convention
We denoted HD, the head word of a mention in a de-
pendency tree, HDLMC and HDRMC, the left-most
child and the right-most child of the head, HDLS and
HDRS, the left and right siblings of the head word,
and HDGOV, the governor of the head word.

From these tokens, we can extract the surface
form, FORM, the part-of-speech tag, POS, and the
grammatical function of the token, FUN, i.e. the la-
bel of the dependency edge of the token to its parent.

We used a naming nomenclature consisting of the
role in the anaphora, where J- stands for the anaphor,
I-, for the antecedent, F-, for the mention in the chain
preceding the antecedent (previous antecedent), and
A- for the first mention of the entity in the chain;
the token we selected from the dependency graph,
e.g. HD or HDLMC; and the value extracted from
the token e.g. POS or FUN. For instance, the part-
of-speech tag of the governor of the head word of
the anaphor is denoted J-HDGOVPOS.

6.2 Combination of Features
In addition to the single features, we combined them
to create bigram, trigram, and four-gram features.
Table 7 shows the features we used, either single or
in combination, e.g. I-HDFORM+J-HDFORM.

66



We emulated a simple cluster model by uti-
lizing the first mention in the chain and/or the
previous antecedent, e.g. A-EDITDISTANCE+F-
EDITDISTANCE+EDITDISTANCE, where the edit
distance of the anaphor is calculated for the first
mention in the chain, previous antecedent, and an-
tecedent.

6.3 Notable New Features

Edit Distance Features. We created edit distance-
based features between pairs of potentially
coreferring mentions: EDITDISTANCE is the
character-based edit distance between two
strings; EDITDISTANCEWORD is a word-level
edit distance, where the symbols are the com-
plete words; and PROPERNAMESIMILARITY
is a character-based edit distance between
proper nouns only.

Discourse Features. We created features to reflect
the speaker agreement, i.e. when the pair of
mentions corresponds to the same speaker, of-
ten in combination with the fact that both men-
tions are pronouns. For example, references to
the first person pronoun I from a same speaker
refer probably to a same entity; in this case, the
speaker himself.

Document Type Feature. We created the I-HD
FORM+J-HDFORM+DOCUMENTTYPE fea-
ture to capture the genre of different document
types, as texts from e.g. the New Testament are
likely to differ from internet blogs.

6.4 Feature Selection

We carried out a greedy forward selection of the fea-
tures starting from Björkelund and Nugues (2011)’s
feature set for English, and Soon et al. (2001)’s for
Chinese and Arabic. The feature selection used a 5-
fold cross-validation over the training set, where we
evaluated the features using the arithmetic mean of
MUC, BCUB, and CEAFE.

After reaching a maximal score using forward se-
lection, we reversed the process using a backward
elimination, leaving out each feature and removing
the one that had the worst impact on performance.
This backwards procedure was carried out until the
score no longer increased. We repeated this forward-

backward procedure until there was no increase in
performance.

7 Evaluation

Table 7 shows the final feature set for each language
combined with the impact each feature has on the
score on the development set when being left out. A
dash (—) means that the feature is not part of the
feature set used in the respective language. As we
can see, some features increase the score. This is
due to the fact that the feature selection was carried
out in a cross-validated manner over the training set.

Table 8 shows the results on the development and
test sets as well as on the test set with gold mentions.
For each language, the figures are overall consistent
between the development and test sets across all the
metrics. The scores improve very significantly with
the gold mentions: up to more than 10 points for
Chinese.

8 Conclusions

The LTH coreference solver used in the CoNLL
2012 shared task uses Soon et al. (2001)’s algorithm
and a set of lexical and nonlexical features. To a
large extent, we extracted these features from the de-
pendency graphs of the sentences. The results we
obtained seem to hint that this approach is robust
across the three languages of the task.

Our system builds on an earlier system that we
evaluated in the CoNLL 2011 shared task (Pradhan
et al., 2011), where we optimized significantly the
solver code, most notably the mention detection step
and the feature design. Although not exactly compa-
rable, we could improve the CoNLL score by 4.83
from 54.53 to 59.36 on the English corpus. The
mention extraction stage plays a significant role in
the overall performance. By improving the qual-
ity of the mentions extracted, we obtained a perfor-
mance increase of 2.35 (Table 6).

Using more complex feature structures also
proved instrumental. Scores of additional feature
variants could be tested in the future and possibly
increase the system’s performance. Due to limited
computing resources and time, we had to confine the
search to a handful of features that we deemed most
promising.
