Abstract

We investigate statistical dependency parsing
of two closely related languages, Croatian and
Serbian. As these two morphologically com-
plex languages of relaxed word order are gen-
erally under-resourced – with the topic of de-
pendency parsing still largely unaddressed, es-
pecially for Serbian – we make use of the
two available dependency treebanks of Croa-
tian to produce state-of-the-art parsing models
for both languages. We observe parsing accu-
racy on four test sets from two domains. We
give insight into overall parser performance
for Croatian and Serbian, impact of prepro-
cessing for lemmas and morphosyntactic tags
and influence of selected morphosyntactic fea-
tures on parsing accuracy.

1 Introduction

Croatian and Serbian are very closely related South
Slavic languages with complex morphology and rel-
atively free word order. They are mutually intel-
ligible with one another, as well as with Bosnian
and Montenegrin, amounting for more than 20 mil-
lion native speakers.1 Regarding language technol-
ogy support, they are considered to be generally
under-resourced. More specifically, while a cor-
pus of research on processing Croatian and Ser-
bian on the morphosyntactic and shallow syntactic

1Bekavac et al. (2008) provide a corpus-based comparison
of Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, observing similarities and
differences in morphology, syntax and semantics. For further
insight regarding Croatian and Serbian morphosyntax, see the
respective contemporary grammars (Silić and Pranjković, 2005;
Stanojčić and Popović, 2008).

layer does exist (Tadić et al., 2012; Vitas et al.,
2012), approaches to full syntactic analysis of the
two languages were up to this point very sparse
and very recent (Agić and Merkler, 2013). As lin-
guistic tradition supports dependency-based syntac-
tic formalisms for the two languages (Böhmová et
al., 2003; Tadić, 2007), it should be noted that
they have not participated in the previous collabo-
rative research efforts in dependency parsing, such
as the CoNLL shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi,
2006; Nivre et al., 2007). Furthermore, regardless of
the specific research topic, the communities dealing
with natural language processing of Croatian, Ser-
bian and other closely related languages from their
group are still to reach the common level of aware-
ness with respect to public availability of their re-
search. Contributions to availability of Croatian and
Serbian resources have once again been very few
and recent (Tadić and Varadi, 2012), especially for
free culture licensing.

Through the line of research we propose here,2 we
seek to provide state-of-the-art in dependency pars-
ing for both Croatian and Serbian. In this first group
of experiments, we build on the fact of their close
relatedness by using the two Croatian treebanks –
Croatian Dependency Treebank (Tadić, 2007) and
SETIMES.HR Treebank (Agić and Merkler, 2013) –
to build unified parsing models and evaluate them
across the languages and domains. As we deal with
highly inflectional languages, we also investigate
the influence of morphological preprocessing and
morphosyntactic feature selection on parsing perfor-

mance. We aim to use this first inquiry as a decision
point regarding further advancements in resource in-
terchangeability in terms of, e.g., annotation projec-
tion (Yarowsky et al., 2001) and domain adaptation
(Søgaard, 2013). Availability is highly emphasized,
as we provide our resources and models to the public
under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license.3 We stress the es-
sential role of free culture licensing in enabling and
maturing NLP for under-resourced languages.

In the following section, we give an overview of
related work in computational processing of Croat-
ian and Serbian morphology and syntax. Further, we
define the experiment objectives and describe the re-
sources and experiment workflow. We elaborate on
the obtained results and conclude by sketching pos-
sible future research plans.

2 Related work

Two overviews of current state of language technol-
ogy development have appeared just recently for the
two languages we investigate in this paper.

The Croatian overview (Tadić et al., 2012) states
that a few underperforming shallow parsing proto-
types for Croatian do exist (Vučković et al., 2008),
while deep parsing is left completely unaddressed.
In contrast, it indicates that the more basic re-
sources – manually annotated corpora, inflectional
lexicons, lemmatizers, morphosyntactic and named
entity taggers – are of higher quality and availability.
Most of these are available through META-SHARE
(Tadić and Varadi, 2012). However, in terms of
mandatory preprocessing for dependency parsing, to
the best of our knowledge, the only freely avail-
able and standard-compliant lemmatization, part-of-
speech (POS) or morphosyntactic (MSD) tagging
resources are those by (Agić et al., 2013).4 Their
elaboration contains a more substantial overview of
preprocessing. Relevant to our research, these mod-
els provide the state of the art in preprocessing for
both Croatian and Serbian.

Croatian Dependency Treebank (HOBS) project
was initiated by (Tadić, 2007). However, its suffi-
ciency in size increase, followed by the first experi-
ments with dependency parsing of Croatian, did not
appear soon enough to be included in the CoNLL

shared tasks and the overview of (Tadić et al.,
2012). Preliminary experiments in transition-based
(Berović et al., 2012) and graph-based parsing have
been augmented by a hybrid approach which in-
cluded integrating a graph-based parser (Hall, 2007)
and a valency lexicon (Agić, 2012). Due to uncov-
ered partial inadequacies of the HOBS formalism
at describing certain syntactic properties of Croa-
tian, a new line of research was initiated, aiming
at creating a more simplistic dependency-based for-
malism for data-driven parsing of Croatian (Agić
and Merkler, 2013). It provided a new freely avail-
able dependency treebank, the SETIMES.HR Tree-
bank, and derived state-of-the-art dependency pars-
ing models.5 On the downside, SETIMES.HR is a
prototype with currently less than 2 500 sentences
and a documented need for addressing certain an-
notation challenges, such as consistent annotation
of complex predicates, an issue that was previously
observed and partially resolved in HOBS as well
(Berović et al., 2012).

The overview of Serbian language technologies
(Vitas et al., 2012) explicitly denotes a satisfac-
tory development level for Serbian preprocessing
based on large electronic dictionaries, manually an-
notated corpora and hand-crafted transducer gram-
mars. These are available through META-SHARE,
even if mostly coupled with restrictive licensing.
Further, the overview lists some preliminary re-
search in shallow syntactic analysis, while it clearly
states that the absence of a formalised syntax of Ser-
bian restricts the development of syntactically anno-
tated corpora and thus hinders the research in full
parsing of Serbian, making the creation of a syntac-
tic formalism for Serbian a very urgent task.

Similar to Croatian, research in Serbian shallow
parsing deals exclusively with the manual design of
rule-based modules (Nenadić, 2000; Nenadić et al.,
2003; Vitas et al., 2003) in linguistic development
enviroments such as Intex and NooJ (Silberztein,
2004). We also inquired into a case study on the pos-
sibilities of resource transfer from English to Ser-
bian (Martinović, 2008), only to conclude that it
does not provide any empirical results. Hence, to
the best of our knowledge, no experiments in de-
pendency treebank construction and data-driven de-

pendency parsing – or, for that matter, any other ap-
proaches to deep syntactic modeling and processing
– currently exist for Serbian.

3 Experiment setup

In this section, we present the experimental setup by
which we aim at subsequently addressing the pre-
viously outlined issues with dependency parsing of
Croatian and Serbian. We define our goals, describe
the utilized resources and lay out the workflow.

3.1 Objectives

We identify the main issues unaddressed by previous
research in Croatian and Serbian syntactic process-
ing and use these to define our research objectives.
They are listed here as follows.

1. No empirical research was conducted in de-
pendency parsing of Serbian. Even if this fact
was justified by the lack of applied research in
creating formalisms targeted exclusively at de-
scribing syntactic properties of Serbian, we fol-
low the underspecification approach that was
successfully implemented in HOBS for Croa-
tian. Namely, as the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) formalism for Czech (Böhmová
et al., 2003) was altogether ported to Croatian
by simply using the PDT annotation manual
for annotating Croatian sentences due to mi-
nor differences in syntactic structure between
Croatian and Czech, we reflect this to the
even greater similarity between Croatian and
Serbian on all levels of linguistic description.
Hence, we use Croatian data to parse Serbian
and to serve as a baseline in Serbian parsing.

2. Using Croatian syntactic models for parsing
Serbian text serves to establish the need for ad-
vanced approaches to porting resources among
languages, such as annotation projection.

3. The best dependency parsing models for Croa-
tian are created and tested using a small pro-
totype treebank. SETIMES.HR currently pro-
vides state of the art in Croatian dependency
parsing. To serve our experiment, we enlarge
it by 50% by following the annotation guide-
lines (Merkler et al., 2013) and provide its new
version to the public.

4. Previous experiments were conducted by ten-
fold cross-validation on treebank data. This is
a standard approach to dependency parser eval-
uation, especially in under-resourced environ-
ments. In this setting, observations are posi-
tively biased by text domain and phrase trans-
fer due to randomization. We seek to partially
account for these effects by designing a set of
language- and domain-aware test samples. By
these we also target at establishing the need for
domain adaptation for parsing.

5. No research was done in investigating the ef-
fects of preprocessing and linguistic feature se-
lection to dependency parsing for these lan-
guages. As these are highly inflectional, hav-
ing very large morphosyntactic tagsets, we seek
to inspect the impact of preprocessing choices
on their dependency parsing. There is am-
ple research on the effect preprocessing has
on dependency parsing (Goldberg and Elhadad,
2009; Mohamed, 2011) and on joint morpho-
logical and syntactic processing (Bohnet and
Nivre, 2012), but none of it included any of the
South Slavic languages.

3.2 Workflow
We define three batches of experiments to meet the
research objectives:

1. to select the best Croatian dependency formal-
ism with respect to its overall parsing accuracy
on Croatian and Serbian – with an emphasis
on the most important syntactic categories that
match across formalisms – and incidentally to
establish the need for annotation projection,

2. to inspect the impact of state-of-the-art auto-
matic preprocessing on dependency parsing of
both languages and

3. to establish the importance of specific Croat-
ian and Serbian morphosyntactic features of the
most frequent parts of speech in modeling syn-
tactic fenomena for dependency parsing.

In the first batch, we use HOBS in two instances
and SETIMES.HR to create parsing models and test
them on Croatian and Serbian test samples. Draw-
ing from previous research, we use a standard non-
projective graph-based MSTParser generator with
second-order features (McDonald et al., 2006), as
this setting favors Croatian (Agić, 2012) and re-

24



lated languages such as Czech and Slovene (Buch-
holz and Marsi, 2006). We are aware of the exis-
tence of novel dependency parsers that implement
approaches to handling non-local dependencies and
outperform MSTParser on a set of languages, such
as (Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). They are not included
here due to temporal constraints and the fact that
we were provided with prebuilt MSTParser models
for the HOBS instances and needed to ensure their
comparability with SETIMES.HR. As we mainly
deal with the concept of resource sharing between
closely related languages, we assign a more elabo-
rated parser selection for future research.

For the second batch, we redo the experiments
from the first batch in a realistic scenario regard-
ing preprocessing. We use the publicly available
state-of-the-art tagging and lemmatization models
for Croatian and Serbian (Agić et al., 2013) instead
of manual annotation to observe the incurred ef-
fects. We do both batches for all three formalisms
(two HOBS instances and SETIMES.HR) and pro-
vide learning curves.

The third batch of experiments deals with ob-
serving the impact of certain morphosyntactic fea-
tures by removing them from training and test data.
We inspect all features involved in subspecification
of adjectives, nouns and verbs in compliance with
the Multext East specification (Erjavec, 2012), i.e.,
MTE v5 as its fifth release.6

In all batches, we observe labeled (LAS) and un-
labeled (UAS) attachment scores. We use approxi-
mate randomization for statistical significance test-
ing where applicable and meaningful.

3.3 Treebanks

Two Croatian dependency treebanks are used in this
experiment: HOBS (Tadić, 2007) and SETIMES.HR
(Agić and Merkler, 2013).

HOBS is available in two instances or implemen-
tations. The first one closely follows the PDT anno-
tation guidelines (Böhmová et al., 2003) with several
adaptations of predicate annotation (Berović et al.,
2012). The second one introduces a set of additional
syntactic tags used for the introduction and subclas-
sification of subordinate clauses. It also alters the
head attachment rules for subordinating conjunc-

tions. This addition enabled consistency in predicate
annotation in clauses and an increase in dependency
parsing accuracy (Agić and Merkler, 2013), while
taking a turn away from the PDT guidelines and to-
wards specifics of Croatian syntax. In the paper,
we refer to this instance of HOBS as HOBS + Sub.
Both of them are based on Croatian newspaper text
and manually preprocessed. They implement a mor-
phosyntactic tagset based on, but slightly deviated
from MTE v4 (Erjavec, 2012). HOBS is available
from META-SHARE for research purposes, but its
syntactic tags are stripped from this version. HOBS
+ Sub is not publicly available. Both have been
made available to us in whole for conducting this
experiment, along with prebuilt MSTParser models
compatible with our experimental settings.

SETIMES.HR is based on Croatian newspaper text

25



from the SETimes parallel corpus.7 It implements a
simplistic new formalism (Merkler et al., 2013) tar-
geting and reaching increased dependency parsing
performance while maintaining the information on
the main syntactic categories and compliance with
the general guidelines for HOBS for these categories
(Agić and Merkler, 2013). It is also manually pre-
processed, but using the newer MTE v5 morphosyn-
tactic tagset. SETIMES.HR is fully compliant with
this tagset. As mentioned, it is freely available for all
purposes. With this in mind, following the annota-
tion guidelines, we have expanded its 2 500 sentence
prototype by introducing 1 365 new sentences.

Treebank statistics are given in Table 1. HOBS
treebanks are larger than SETIMES.HR by approxi-
mately 800 sentences, i.e., 30 thousand tokens (30
kw). The morphosyntactic tagsets also differ, favor-
ing SETIMES.HR and MTE v5 by 250 tags if we are
to consider the smaller tagset as better in terms of
the expressivity vs. preprocessing accuracy balanc-
ing. Syntactic tagset of SETIMES.HR has only 15
tags. Tag counts for HOBS treebanks are given by
two figures: the first one represents the basic tagset,
while the second one includes the subclassification
tags. For example, a coordinated predicate is anno-
tated as Pred using the basic tagset and as Pred Co
in the full tagset. Here, we use only the basic tagset.

As we anticipated given the properties of Croat-
ian syntax, non-projectivity is amply present in both
treebanks. Approximately 2% of all dependency re-
lations and more than 20% of all sentences are non-
projective, supporting our parser selection.

As the three treebanks – HOBS, HOBS + Sub and
SETIMES.HR– formally do implement different ap-
proaches to syntactic modeling, issues may be raised
regarding the comparability of dependency parsing
scores. However, since HOBS and HOBS + Sub are
both based on the PDT formalism and SETIMES.HR
implements a simplistic formalism that is still based
on the PDT and HOBS annotation guidelines and
syntactic tagset reduction (Merkler et al., 2013), we
consider the comparison to be valid. Moreover, all
three formalisms encode the main Croatian syntactic
categories by closely following the general guide-
lines for describing the Croatian syntax (Silić and
Pranjković, 2005), thus indicating that comparisons

7http://opus.lingfil.uu.se/SETIMES2.php

for the main syntactic categories – such as predi-
cates, subjects, objects, prepositional and adverbial
phrases – should hold true for the task of depen-
dency parsing irregardless of the formal differences
between the models.

3.4 Test sets

The publicly available test sets are obtained from an
experiment in lemmatization and tagging of Croat-
ian and Serbian (Agić et al., 2013). They were avail-
able in MTE v4 and v5. As HOBS uses the former
and SETIMES.HR the latter tagset, they were well-
suited for our experiment. We syntactically anno-
tated the test sets threefold, i.e., by using the HOBS,
HOBS + Sub and SETIMES.HR formalisms. There
are four test samples: Croatian and Serbian paral-
lel sentences from newspaper sources (set.test) and
Wikipedia (wiki.test). Their suitability for testing
models on closely related languages was thoroughly
elaborated by (Agić et al., 2013), where their dif-
ferences were measured by using inflectional lexi-
cons of Croatian and Serbian and were found to be
significant in supporting the difference between the
languages. Namely, lexical coverage differed by ap-
proximately 10 percentage points in favor of Croat-
ian across the two domains.

Statistics for the test set are given in Table 2. Each
sample has 100 sentences or approximately 2 000
tokens. Slight variations in token, type and lemma
counts are present and reflect the domain differ-
ences. MSD tag and syntactic tag counts reflect the
respective formalisms, as not all HOBS and HOBS
+ Sub syntactic tags are utilized, while all 15 SE-
TIMES.HR tags are present in all the samples. HOBS
tag counts are once again given separately for the
basic and the full tagset, while only the basic subset
was used in the experiment.

Inter-annotator agreement for HOBS, HOBS +
Sub and SETIMES.HR is investigated in (Agić and
Merkler, 2013). It favors SETIMES.HR over HOBS
+ Sub and HOBS + Sub over HOBS with a statis-
tically significant difference. The CoNLL shared
tasks in dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi,
2006; Nivre et al., 2007) used test sets of approx-
imately 5 000 tokens. This may raise an issue re-
garding the relatively small size of our domain test
samples. However, in the experiment, we combine
the test sets by domain and by language and also

merge them into a single test set, thus accounting
for the size of the individual samples.

3.5 Parser setup

Here we use MSTParser with the non-projective
maximum spanning tree parsing algorithm and sec-
ond order features (decode-type:non-proj
order:2 training-k:5 iters:10), as it
was previously established as the optimal set-
ting for parsing Croatian using MSTParser (Agić,
2012) with a statistically significant margin over
the transition-based approach. In training and test-
ing, we separate the MTE v5 MSD tags into POS
(CPOSTAG) and full MSD (POSTAG). We do not
separate the MSD tags into atomic features, i.e., we
do not utilize the FEATS column of the CoNLL-X
format. Thus the MSD tags themselves are consid-
ered as atomic features in the experiment, both for
the full MTE v5 tagset and its reductions.

4 Results and discussion

Here we report and discuss the obtained results. We
discuss the results in batches, as in the experiment
workflow description. In addition, we give a brief
linguistic analysis of the parsing errors considering
the difference between the two languages and the
fact that Croatian models were used for parsing both
Croatian and Serbian text.

4.1 Formalism selection

In the first experiment batch, we trained the parsing
models using three treebanks, HOBS, HOBS + Sub

and SETIMES.HR, and tested them on our Croatian
and Serbian test sets from Wikipedia and newspa-
per text. We present the overall scores in Table 3,
the learning curves are plotted in the first diagram
of Figure 1 and the accuracy for selected syntactic
categories are given in Table 4.

Regarding the formalism selection process, in-
specting the overall observed LAS and UAS, it is
evident that models based on SETIMES.HR outper-
form HOBS-based models by a large margin. They
outperform HOBS + Sub by approximately 9 LAS
and 3 UAS points, while their overall advantage is
even more substantial in comparison with the scores
of basic HOBS models – approximately 17 LAS
and 7 UAS points. Benefits of explicit annotation
of predicates by introducing tags for subordinating
syntactic conjunctions are also evident as HOBS
+ Sub parsers outperform HOBS by 8 LAS and 4
UAS points. These observations maintain the con-
clusions about the three formalisms given in previ-
ous research (Agić and Merkler, 2013).8 Moreover,
the introduction of a held-out test set further steep-
ens these differences, as the previous tests were per-
formed by tenfold cross-validation using treebank
data only. The observed differences in overall LAS
and UAS scores are shown to be significant by the
approximate randomization test (p < 0.01).9

As stated in the presentation of treebanks in the
previous section, since the three formalisms are
closely related to one another and to the general
guidelines for describing the properties of Croatian
dependency syntax, we find this comparison to hold
true regardless of the formal differences between
the models. Moreover, since the accuracy for the
PDT-based formalisms in this and previous experi-
ments with Croatian dependency parsing (Agić and
Merkler, 2013) is below the margins set by similar
languages such as Czech and Slovene (Buchholz and

8Importance of standard compliance should be noted regard-
ing the morphosyntactic tagset impact on the observed results.
Namely, HOBS ”slightly deviates” from MTE v4 by design,
while still claiming de facto compliance. As the test sets fully
comply with MTE v4 and v5, this has an effect on parsing.

9We test by randomly (prob = 0.5) inserting alternate syn-
tactic annotations for entire test set sentences and evaluating
with respect to annotation style, i.e., selecting to match the sen-
tence annotations against HOBS, HOBS + Sub or SETIMES.HR
layer in the gold standard annotation.

27

and morphosyntactic tagging

Marsi, 2006)10, we argue that HOBS requires thor-
ough further revision if it is to be the Croatian coun-
terpart of PDT in terms of expressivity and usability
in research and practical applications. This is further
supported by the data in Table 4, where the assign-
ment of specific syntactic tags is explored. However,
extrinsic evaluation would also be beneficial.

The differences in LAS and UAS scores between
the two languages are virtually non-existent across
formalisms and domains. The parsing models fa-
vor Croatian newspaper text by less than 2 LAS
points for all three formalisms, while UAS is ap-
proximately 1 UAS point higher in Serbian newspa-
per text for HOBS and HOBS + Sub, in contrast with
SETIMES.HR, which scores 1 UAS point higher for
the Croatian sample. In the Wikipedia samples, LAS
and UAS may be approximated as identical. In total,
as a top-performer, the SETIMES.HR model scored
74.5 LAS and 80.9 UAS on Croatian samples and
74.1 LAS and 80.6 UAS on Serbian samples. We be-
lieve this indicates that the parsing models trained on
Croatian treebank data can be used reliably for both
Croatian and Serbian text. We also use these figures
to imply no need for syntactic annotation projection
between Croatian and Serbian in this test scenario.

The cross-domain differences in LAS and UAS
are, in contrast with the cross-language differences,

10This holds even with the Slovene treebank of the CoNLL
2006 shared task having more than 2 000 sentences less than
HOBS, with both using the PDT formalism

much more substantial. As all treebanks were built
on top of Croatian newspaper text, scores are ex-
pectedly higher for these test samples in comparison
with the Wikipedia samples’ scores. This difference
amounts to approximately 5 LAS points and 2 UAS
points in favor of the newspaper text samples across
the two languages and three formalisms.

We plotted the LAS learning curves by merging
the test samples into a single mixed-language test
set, incrementally creating 8 parsing models per for-
malism (12.5% to 100% of full size) and testing
them on this merged test set. The left plot of Figure 1
represents the learning curves for the three treebanks
peaking at previously discussed scores from Table 3.
The curves clearly reflect the overall differences in
scores. Their rate of increase is consistently com-
parable, with the overall difference in favor of SE-
TIMES.HR due to its smaller yet still informative
syntactic tagset and its formalism better suited for
Croatian syntax. With this fact now once again
empirically supported, we select the top-performing
SETIMES.HR parsing model for further inspection.
Thus, our further discussion deals exclusively with
parsing using SETIMES.HR.

First we observe parsing accuracy regarding syn-
tactic categories, where we still do compare SE-
TIMES.HR with HOBS + Sub as a final reference
point. We merged our test sets by language to pro-
vide Croatian and Serbian cross-domain test sam-
ples and calculate the LAS per syntactic category for

the two languages. This data is presented in Table 4.
Once again, the language variety is seen to be of no
significance to the parsing models. The scores ac-
tually alternate in favoring the two languages. SE-
TIMES.HR substantially outperforms HOBS + Sub
on the most frequent and arguably the most infor-
mative categories, such as predicate and subject (at
least 5 LAS points), object (almost 20 LAS points)
and attribute (6 points LAS).

4.2 Preprocessing and features

Here we discuss the impact of automatic preprocess-
ing, i.e., lemmatization and MSD tagging on depen-
dency parsing in our test framework. As announced,
this discussion deals exclusively with SETIMES.HR.
We lemmatize and tag the test samples by using
freely available state-of-the-art models for Croatian
and Serbian (Agić et al., 2013), parse them using
our best SETIMES.HR model and observe LAS and
UAS. Preprocessing performance is given in Table 5

Table 6: Parsing accuracy (LAS, UAS) with automatic
preprocessing

as a reference point while, more importantly, the de-
pendency parsing scores are given in Table 6. The
second plot of Figure 1 provides the learning curves
for the automatically preprocessed test sets.

Table 6 scores are easily elaborated using the pre-
viously discussed scores with manual, i.e., gold or
perfect preprocessing. Namely, the impact of differ-
ences between manual and automatic preprocessing
on parsing quality basically amounts to a very sim-
ple formula: LAS is reduced by 3-4 points and UAS
by 2 points when introducing preprocessing noise
by automatic lemmatization and tagging. This ob-
servation is valid across the languages and domains
of our test set and thus applies generally. Keeping
in mind the more complex prospective NLP systems
for Croatian and Serbian, we consider this fact to
be very favorable as the observed 16% error rate in
full MSD tagging, 5-6% for POS and lemmatization,
amounts for a significantly smaller decrease in pars-
ing quality as quantified by LAS and UAS.

To further support this observation, we conducted
an experiment with purposely corrupting lemmatiza-
tion and tagging. In this, as previously for learning
curves, we use the single merged test sample. For
lemmatization, we randomly drop lemmas from the
manually annotated test sample, replacing them with
empty features.11 For MSD tagging, we implement
two procedures. The first is identical with the one for
lemmatization, while in the second we replace the
valid tag with a randomly selected Croatian tag from
the full MTE v5 morphosyntactic tagset. For each

11In terms of the CoNLL-X format, we simply replace the
valid entry from the LEMMA field by an underscore.

of these scenarios, we provide 11 test sets: step-
ping by 10% of removals or random insertions, from
0% to 100% preprocessing accuracy. The results
are plotted in Figure 2. Evidently, lemmatization
is of no influence to dependency parsing using our
model. This is an important observation to consider
in, e.g., the future tasks of parsing large web cor-
pora of Croatian and Serbian. The large impact of
morphosyntactic tagging, i.e., morphosyntactic fea-
tures on parsing is also evident from the figure. It
is also supported by previous research in parsing us-
ing SETIMES.HR (Agić and Merkler, 2013), where
a significant bias towards MSD-based parsing mod-
els was found over the POS-only-based models. Tag
removal and tag randomization appear to induce a
very similar effect of near-linear functional depen-
dency between tagging and parsing. We note that
this is not entirely supported by our realistic prepro-
cessing test scenario. It is purely due to the fact that
our noise introduction procedure does not relate to
the modus in which the stochastic tagger errs in pro-
cessing unseen text. Namely, MSD tagging errors

Figure 2: Overall SETIMES.HR parsing accuracy in rela-
tion with lemmatization and morphosyntactic tagging

tend to occur on certain morphosyntactic features,
corrupting these much more often than entire tags.
Thus, even when it yields a feature error, the tagger
still provides the parser with other valid features to
work with. This consideration of MSD features, in
pair with the following set of results, sketches our
plans for further research.

Following the previous note on MSD tagset and
features, we also implemented a simple experiment
in feature weight assessment. In it, we used the SE-
TIMES.HR treebank with full MTE v5 tagset and
created from it several instances, each with its own
reduced MTE v5 tagset. Each reduction was de-
fined by dropping one MSD feature from one part
of speech. More precisely, we dropped all MSD
features of adjectives (5 features), nouns (4) and
verbs (5). This amounted at 14 different MTE v5
reductions. We trained 14 parsing models using SE-
TIMES.HR with the reduced tagsets and tested them
on the test samples merged by language and imple-
menting the respective tagset reductions.

The results are given in Table 7. Most notably,
we observed an increase in parsing accuracy when
dropping adjective case and verb type. The most
substantial decrease occurred with the removal of
noun case, indicating the importance of this feature
in parsing the two languages. We consider the ad-
jective case removal gain an important observation
for future work, as adjectives are the most difficultly

4.3 Error analysis

Here we provide a brief insight to the error instances.
We discuss LAS errors for both languages, i.e., in-
stances of invalid head attachments paired with tag
misassignments. These are given in Table 8 in the
form of two confusion matrices for LAS.

We isolate several clusters of errors with shared
linguistic properties. Firstly, the subject-attribute-
apposition group (Sb-Atr-Ap), in which we find
the error instances to be closely related to the or-
der of attachment and assignment in multi-word
units representing foreign personal names, titles or
functions and occupations of persons. Next, the
attribute-adverb-object group (Atr-Adv-Obj) expect-
edly appears as these are inherently ambiguous cat-
egories.12 The predicate-nominal-auxiliary group of
errors (Pred-Pnom-Aux) reflects the interaction of
MSD annotation choices and syntactic annotation
principles, as participes are MSD-tagged as adjec-
tives, thus confusing the parser in predicate annota-
tion. Moreover, SETIMES.HR has documented is-
sues with consistency in complex predicate anno-
tation that seek resolution and negatively influence
the parsing scores. Lastly, the only error group sub-
stantially reflecting the language difference is the
one involving predicates and predicate complements
(Pred-Atv), as it appears only in the Serbian confu-
sions. Namely, the infinitive predicate complement
is frequent in Croatian and non-existent in Serbian.
Infinitives in Serbian only appear for the future tense
paired with auxiliary verbs, confusing the parser to

12PDT, e.g., has an AtrAdv, AdvAtr, AtrObj and ObjAtr am-
biguity classes to address this. However, the sum of their fre-
quencies in HOBS is negligibly small (< 0.03%).

annotate these infinitives as predicate complements
as observed in the Croatian training data.

5 Conclusions and future work

We have described an experiment with dependency
parsing of two closely related and under-resourced
languages, Croatian and Serbian, by using parsing
models trained on Croatian treebanks. We investi-
gated three different parsing formalisms, the effects
of lemmatization, morphosyntactic tagging and fea-
ture selection on parsing quality for both languages.
We observed state-of-the-art parsing scores. All re-
sources used in the experiment are made publicly
available under a permissive license.13

The results of this experiment sketch the path for
our future research. Experiments with syntactic pro-
jection between Croatian and Serbian are not feasi-
ble given the negligible differences in the observed
scores. In contrast, domain adaptation for pars-
ing the two languages should be investigated given
the observed accuracy decrease when moving from
newspaper text to Wikipedia. We have already initi-
ated further enlargements of the SETIMES.HR tree-
bank and the test sets with Croatian data from other
domains. Experiments with newer and more ad-
vanced dependency parsers (Koo and Collins, 2010;
Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Zhang and McDonald,
2012; Martins et al., 2013) should be conducted to
provide up-to-date scores.

We are currently experimenting with morphosyn-
tactic tagset design for improved dependency pars-
ing of Croatian and Serbian. We aim at finding the
optimal tagset by closely investigating morphosyn-
tactic feature influences and dependencies.
