ABSTRACT
There is a demand for taxonomies to organise large collections of documents into categories
for browsing and exploration. This paper examines four existing taxonomies that have been
manually created, along with two methods for deriving taxonomies automatically from data
items. We use these taxonomies to organise items from a large online cultural heritage collection.
We then present two human evaluations of the taxonomies. The first measures the cohesion
of the taxonomies to determine how well they group together similar items under the same
concept node. The second analyses the concept relations in the taxonomies. The results show
that the manual taxonomies have high quality well defined relations. However the novel
automatic method is found to generate very high cohesion.

1 Introduction
With increasingly large sets of diverse collections of documents available online a key challenge
is organising and presenting these items effectively for information access. To enable the
navigation and exploration of collections, content providers typically provide users with free-
text search functionalities, along with some form of browsable subject categories or taxonomy,
also useful in organising documents. Providing multiple mechanisms for accessing documents
enables users to conduct various modes of information seeking activity, from locating specific
documents to more exploratory forms of searching and browsing behaviour (Hearst, 2009;
Marchionini, 2006; Wilson et al., 2010).

In this paper we focus on evaluating different taxonomies that could be used to organise
and navigate content from Europeana1, an online cultural heritage collection. This collection
comprises many subcollections taken from different providers, and thus contains a very diverse
set of cultural heritage items2. Some of the subcollections are linked to bespoke taxonomies;
however, many are not. This therefore represents a very challenging dataset to organise in a
consistent and uniform manner. We focus on two main approaches for organising content: the
first is to map items from Europeana onto existing manually-created taxonomies; the second
is to use data-driven approaches to automatically derive taxonomies from the collection. This
requires being able to successfully group items into categories and generate suitable category
labels. A note on definitions: the term ‘taxonomy’ is used in this paper as a general term
meaning a conceptual hierarchy. A taxonomy does not necessarily have to be a subsumption
hierarchy (where each child concept is subsumed by its parent concept). Some of the taxonomies
described here are subsumption hierarchies and some are not.

There are many different ways of evaluating taxonomies (Snow et al., 2004; Malaisé et al.,
2006; Yi, 2008; Nikolova et al., 2010; Ponzetto and Strube, 2011). Here we focus on two
approaches which capture different qualities of the taxonomies. The first evaluation measures
the cohesion of the taxonomies; how well they group together similar items into the same
concept node. The second analyses the relationships between concept nodes in the taxonomies
and whether people can understand the concept labels. We believe this is the first time that
such evaluations have been applied to such taxonomies over large collections of data items.

This paper provides three main contributions: (1) the systematic comparison of different
taxonomies for organising a large cultural heritage collection; (2) a novel data-driven approach
based on using Wikipedia article links as concept nodes in the taxonomy; and (3) the evaluation
of cohesion and relationship type between concepts using an approach based on crowdsourcing.
The rest of the paper comprises the following. Section 2 describes related work in this area.
Section 3 gives a brief overview of the key data resources and tools referenced and Section 4
describes the taxonomies and item-to-resource mapping approaches used in the experiments.
Section 5 describes the cohesion and relatedness experiments and the results obtained.

2 Related work
There are many category systems or taxonomies available, some of which are domain specific;
others aimed at covering more general subjects. For example, one of the most popular and
commonly used resources is the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)3. LCSH provides

1http://www.europeana.eu
2An item is defined here as a online record of a cultural heritage artifact (usually an image), together with associated

metadata, such as title, subject, description etc.
3http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/

a controlled vocabulary of keywords (or subject headings), which are widely used in libraries to
catalogue materials and facilitate information access. Similarly, in the medical domain MeSH4,
created and maintained by the National Library of Medicine, provides a controlled vocabulary
of medical subject headings. In computational linguistics, WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a
commonly used lexical knowledge base that links concepts in various ways. WordNet has been
expanded with WordNet domain labels which group together words from different syntactic
categories and different senses (Bentivogli et al., 2004). These domain labels are organised
into a hierarchical structure.

There is a body of previous work on automatically deriving taxonomies and relations from free
text. Hearst (1992) was perhaps the earliest significant effort to derive hyponym-hypernym
relations from free text using the now eponymous Hearst patterns which code common syntactic
forms of the hyponymy pattern (e.g. ‘Vehicles such as Cars’). These patterns were hand-crafted.
More recently Snow et al. (2004) developed on this work by using an existing knowledge base
to automatically derive lexico-syntactic patterns containing the hyponym-hypernym pairs.

An alternative to creating hierarchies of concepts from the pattern-based methods is to use
statistical methods. Sanderson and Croft (1999) used an approach to automatically build
a hierarchy of terms or concepts (nouns and noun phrases) based on term co-occurrences
within a set of documents. To order the concepts a statistical relation called subsumption was
used to determine which of a co-occurring pair of concepts was most likely to be the parent.
Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2004) uses Bayesian methods and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
to derive topic clusters and create a topic hierarchy. Recent work has exploited the information
in Wikipedia to create taxonomies. Ponzetto and Strube (2011) uses the category hierarchy
along with lexical matching methods to create a taxonomy which compares well with manually
created resources. DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) also uses the Wikipedia category hierarchy but
also additionally links in the articles into the hierarchy.

One key problem is how to evaluate taxonomies effectively. This is a complex problem since
there are many aspects to consider. We can consider how users would rate various aspects of
their experience using a questionnaire. However this subjective study can be misleading since
people can underrate or overrate their experience. A more objective approach is to log user
interactions and then infer from these how effective the taxonomy is i.e. time spent on a task,
how much of the domain was covered and so on. There have been user studies of taxonomies
which have used combinations of both of these approaches (Malaisé et al., 2006; Yi, 2008;
Nikolova et al., 2010). There is also an important distinction to be made between the data
content of a taxonomy and the methods used for visualisation. There have been user studies
which have focussed on evaluation different visualisations while keeping the data constant
(Katifori et al., 2007). In this paper we are considering only the data content, the concepts and
relations, so visualisations are kept constant.

User studies are certainly important. However these studies often don’t answer certain questions
about the taxonomy. We can measure aspects of their experience but we might not have a
fine-grained understanding of which aspects of the taxonomy were positively or negatively
perceived. Also such studies require users to be physically present at a machine specially
set up for logging. This can make such studies expensive and time-consuming. A different
approach is to use intrinsic evaluations. Yu et al. (2007) present a wide range of ontology
evaluation approaches as applied to variations of the Wikipedia category structure such as

4http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/

881



fanout, tangledness, relationship richness, class richness, importance connectivity and cohesion.
Cohesion attempts to measure the degree to which similar items are clustered together under a
single node in the taxonomy. This was initially proposed by (Boyd-Graber et al., 2009) and has
also recently been applied to cultural heritage (Hall et al., 2012).

Another evaluation is to measure the accuracy of the child-parent pairs from the taxonomies by
asking evaluators to classify them as either isa or notisa relations (Snow et al., 2004; Ponzetto
and Strube, 2011). A similar method is used here but expanded to give a more detailed
understanding of the types of the relations found in the different taxonomies.

3 Resources and tools

This section lists some key resources and tools that are used in this paper.

3.1 Wikipedia Miner

The Wikipedia Miner (Milne and Witten, 2008) tool is used in this paper both as a tool to help
map items into existing taxonomies and as a way to generate a novel taxonomy from scratch.
Wikipedia Miner is a Wikification tool which adds inline links to Wikipedia articles into free text.
The software is trained on Wikipedia articles, and thus learns to disambiguate and detect links
in the same way as Wikipedia editors. Disambiguation of terms within the text is performed
first. A machine-learning classifier is used with several features. The main features used are
commonness and relatedness, as in Medelyan et al. (2008). The commonness of a target sense is
defined by the number of times it is used a destination from some anchor text e.g. the anchor
text ‘Tree’ links to the article about the plant more often than the mathematical concept and is
thus more common. Relatedness gives a measure of the similarity of two articles by comparing
their incoming and outgoing links. The performance achieved using their approach is currently
state of the art for this task. The Wikipedia Miner software is freely available5.

3.2 Europeana cultural heritage collection

Cultural heritage items from Europeana are used for the evaluation. Europeana is a large
online aggregation of cultural heritage collections from across Europe. In this paper a snapshot
of the English subset of the data from March 2011 is used. This comprises 547780 items in
total. Each item consists of an XML metadata record. This comprises a number of fields the
most informative of which are dc:title, dc:subject, dc:description which contain the
title, subject keywords and a textual description of the item. About 74% of the items have an
associated image which is displayed on the portal website. A difficulty with this collection is
that a significant number of the items have very little associated metadata. In the worst case
some items have only a one-word title, with no subject or description. This problem is dealt
with implicitly in the methods described below, where such sparse records are effectively filtered
out in the mapping and taxonomy generation stages and are not included in the evaluations.

4 Taxonomies and mappings

Six taxonomies were tested in these experiments. Four of these were based on existing
taxonomies which have been mostly manually created: the Library of Congress Subject Headings,
WordNet Domains, Wikipedia Taxonomy and DBpedia. The remaining two taxonomies were
automatically derived from the metadata present for the items in the collections: WikiFreq and

5http://wikipedia-miner.cms.waikato.ac.nz/

882



LDA topics. This section gives a description of each of these taxonomies and how the items in
the collection were mapped into them. Statistics for each taxonomy are presented at the end of
this section.

4.1 Manually created taxonomies

4.1.1 Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)

The LCSH comprises a controlled vocabulary maintained by the United States Library of
Congress for use in bibliographic records. They are used in many libraries to organise their
collections as well as for organising materials online.

The text from the dc:subject field in the Europeana item are used for the mapping. The text
is lemmatized using Freeling (Padró, 2011). The text is compared to the category labels for the
LCSH concepts. If the text contains any of the category labels then the item is matched to these
categories. If more than one matching label is found, then the longest matching label is used
for the mapping.

4.1.2 WordNet domains

The WordNet hierarchy is a fine-grained classification which is too detailed for browsing, with
more than a hundred thousand nodes and concepts like entity, natural phenomenon and body of
water. Instead WordNet domains organises the WordNet concepts into a smaller hierarchy, with
only 164 domain labels which are easily understood by a general user. The domain labels have
been semi-automatically applied to each of the synsets in WordNet. Each synset is annotated
with each one label from a set of about two hundred. The information provided by the domain
labels is complementary to the data existing already in WordNet. The domain labels group
together words from different syntactic categories (e.g. nouns and verbs), and also may group
together different senses of the same word and thus reduce polysemy.

WordNet domains lists the domain labels for all open class words in WordNet, but it only
contains a few proper nouns. Given the large concentration of proper nouns in Europeana, we
extend the list of words using Yago2. Yago2 (Hoffart et al., 2011) is a knowledge base derived
from Wikipedia with more than 10 million entities, and each entity in Yago2 is linked to a
WordNet 3.0 synset. We also used a mapping from WordNet 3.0 synsets to WordNet Domain
labels as provided by the Multilingual Central Repository (MCR) (Atserias et al., 2004). To
perform the mapping, the first step is again to use the dc:subject field to link Europeana
items to Yago2 entities (using lemmatization and finding the longest possible match). These
are then mapped to the WordNet Domain labels via the Yago2 entity-to-synset and the MCR
synset-to-WordNetDomain mappings.

4.1.3 Wikipedia Taxonomy

Wikipedia Taxonomy (Ponzetto and Strube, 2011) is a taxonomy derived from Wikipedia
categories. The authors create the Wikipedia Taxonomy by keeping the isa relations between
Wikipedia categories and discarding the rest. We first apply Wikipedia Miner (see Section 3.1)
over the Europeana items to find the relevant Wikipedia entities in the the dc:subject field.
Then, we link the Europeana item to all Wikipedia Taxonomy categories which are related to
these entities.

883



4.1.4 DBpedia ontology

The DBpedia ontology (Auer et al., 2007) is a small, shallow ontology manually created based
on information derived from Wikipedia. Contrary to the previous vocabularies described above,
the DBpedia ontology is a formalised ontology, including inference capabilities. The authors
provide the instances of each ontology class, i.e. the set of Wikipedia entities pertaining to
this class. For mapping Europeana items to DBpedia ontology classes, we first apply Wikipedia
Miner to find the relevant Wikipedia entities to the item, and then link the item to the classes
these entities belong.

4.2 Automatically created data-driven taxonomies

4.2.1 LDA topic modelling

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a state-of-the-art topic modelling algorithm, that creates a
mapping between a set of topics T and a set of items I , where each item i ∈ I is linked to one
or more topics t ∈ T . Each item is input into LDA as a bag-of-words and then represented as a
probabilistic mixture of topics. The LDA model consists of a multinomial distribution of items
over topics where each topic is itself a multinomial distribution over words. The item-topic and
topic-word distributions are learned simultaneously using collapsed Gibbs sampling based on
the item - word distributions observed in the source collection (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
LDA has been used to successfully improve result quality in Information Retrieval (Azzopardi
et al., 2004; Wei and Croft, 2006) tasks and is thus well suited to support exploration in digital
libraries.

To turn the flat LDA topic model into a navigable hierarchy, Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2004)
describe a hierarchical LDA approach. However this was found to be prohibitively time
consuming given our large data-set. Instead a recursive divide and conquer approach was
used, which was much more efficient. The number of topic groups at each stage was limited
to a maximum of 9 to make the hierarchy manageable for users to navigate. The algorithm is
outlined below.

1) Run LDA over the corpus to determine the document-topic probabilities. The number of
topics topic_n to generate is automatically determined using this equation:

topic_n=min(9,

��documents_in_corpus
��

30
) (1)

2) For each topic used the document-topic probabilities that LDA outputs to identify the set
of documents associated with that topic. Each document is assigned only to its highest-
probability topic. While this removes some of the power inherent in the LDA topic model,
we believe that from a navigational perspective it is better if each document is located at
only one point in the hierarchy and not at multiple points. To give each topic a label, we
simply selected the highest-probability word from each topic’s topic-word distribution.

3) If a topic set has less than 60 items then stop. Otherwise go back to 1) using the set of items
identified in 2) as the corpus.

884



4.2.2 Wikipedia link frequencies

This is a novel method for taxonomy creation which uses Wikipedia article links as the concept
nodes in the taxonomy. The first step is to add inline article links to all the item texts in the
collection using Wikipedia Miner (see Section 3.1). A confidence threshold of 0.5 was used to
help ensure the links were of high quality - that is they are correctly disambiguated and relevant
to the topic of the item.

The first step is to find the frequency counts of all article links that occur in the items. Let L be
the set of all links found in the items. Then the frequency function F : L→ N gives the global
frequency count for occurrences of the link in all items.

The following procedure is then used for each item to create and populate the taxonomy. Let
S ⊂ L be the set of links found in that item. The links are ordered in S by order of frequency
according to the F function (most frequently occuring first) to give an ordered list of links
a1, a2, a3 · · · an. The item is then inserted into the tree under the branch a1→ a2→ a3 · · · → an,
with a1 at the top level in the tree and the item appearing under the node an. If this branch
does not already exist in the tree then it is created.

It was found that using this approach the branching factor was very high at some levels so the
number of child nodes at each level was limited to at most 20. Furthermore only items with at
least 2 links were used to prevent a large number of single-linked items appearing at the top
level. Concepts with less than 20 items were also filtered out.

This method is labelled WikiFreq in the remainder of the paper.

4.3 Taxonomy statistics

Table 1 shows some statistics for each taxonomy:

• The number of items that are mapped into the taxonomy.
• The average number of parents for each item.
• The average depth from the root node to an item.
• The number of top level nodes in the taxonomy.

A problem with some of the manual taxonomies is the very high number of top level nodes,
which makes it difficult for users to browse. However there is no obvious way to select suitable
top level nodes in these taxonomies. Additionally some of the taxonomies assign items to many
parent nodes - this means that the data is repeated across the taxonomy. This is not a problem
in itself, but is likely to mean that items may often be assigned to incorrect nodes.

5 Experiments

Two evaluations were performed on the taxonomies. The first measured the cohesion of the
item clustering, and the second gathered human judgements of the relations that were found
between child-parent concept pairs in the taxonomy. For both evaluations online surveys were
created using an in-house crowdsourcing interface. Links to the surveys were sent out to a
mailing list comprising thousands of students and staff members at the University of Sheffield.

5.1 Cohesion

A cohesive cluster is defined as one in which the items are similar while at the same time clearly
distinguishable from items in other clusters (Tan et al., 2006). To measure the cohesiveness
of the taxonomies we use the intruder detection task originally devised in Boyd-Graber et al.
(2009) and recently used for cultural heritage items in Hall et al. (2012). The idea of this is to
present 5 items to an evaluator. Four of these are taken from one concept node in the taxonomy
and the other (the intruder) is randomly picked from elsewhere in the taxonomy. The more
cohesive the concept in the taxonomy the more obvious it should be which is the intruder item.
Each unit was displayed as a list of five images along with the titles of the items. An example6

of a cohesive unit is shown in Figure 1. To generate good quality units for the evaluation the
informativeness of items was calculated as follows:

in f ormativeness(i tem) = leng th(i temt i t le)/avg Lt i t le ∗ log(N/count(i temt i t le))
+leng th(i temdesc)/avg Ldesc ∗ log(N/count(i temdesc))
+leng th(i temsub j)/avg Lsub j ∗ log(N/count(i temsub j))

where t i t le, desc, sub j refer to the title, description and subject fields of the metadata, avg LX
is the average length of field X over the whole collection, leng th(i temX ) is the length of that
item field text, and count(i temX ) gives the frequency of that item field text over the whole
collection. The higher the resulting value the more informative the item is. Note that as well as
taking into account the length of the fields, this also weights by the inverse document frequency
(idf) value, so very frequently occuring terms will be downweighted.

The most informative items were selected for each category. This helped to ensure that the users
were presented with informative items, allowing them to have enough information to decide
which was most likely to be the intruder. The same also applies to the taxonomy mappings
being evaluated; it is difficult to correctly map items with very little information in the metadata.
The procedure for selecting the sample units was as follows:

Six units were shown on each page, one of which was always a control unit. The control units
were manually chosen to be examples where the intruder was very obvious. The purpose of the
control units was to ensure the quality of the judgements, since if a participant got the control
unit wrong it was an indication that they were not taking the task seriously.

Thirty non-control units were created from each taxonomy. Altogether 134 people attempted
the survey. 23 of the users evaluated at least one control unit wrong, or evaluated less than 5
units in total, and so their answers were excluded. The remaining 111 participants contributed
a total of 1255 answers. Each unit received a minimum of 5 answers and an average of 6.97
answers. A unit was judged as cohesive if more than 80% of the annotators agreed on the same
intruder.

Table 2: Number of coherent units (out of 30) for each of the taxonomies.

The results (Table 2) show that most of the taxonomies achieved roughly the same level of
cohesion for the clusters, roughly between 50 and 63%. However the WikiFreq taxonomy
performed far better, with only one unit of the 30 judged as not coherent. This success shows
that the Wikipedia links are very effective as a means of grouping together similar items. This
might be explained by considering that items grouped together under the same node will share
a number of keywords which link to the same Wikipedia articles which would ensure that the
items are very similar. In contrast the Wikipedia taxonomy and DBpedia ontology use categories
rather than articles in Wikipedia as the concept nodes. These are much more loosely defined;
each article in Wikipedia can belong to many categories and each category contains many
articles. The results also indicate that Wikipedia articles as entities are much more clearly
defined than the LDA topic keywords and thus work much better at grouping together the
similar items.

5.2 Relation classification

Previous work has evaluated taxonomies by presenting child-parent pairs of concept nodes
to evaluators and asking them a simple boolean question - does the pair represents a valid
hypernymic relation, i.e. is it true that "ChildNode isa ParentNode"? (Ponzetto and Strube,
2011; Snow et al., 2004). We would expect the manually created taxonomies to perform well
here. The automatic methods also intend to create a hierarchical structure, with more general
concepts at the top nodes going to more specific in the lower nodes.

Here we conduct a slightly deeper analysis of what kinds of relations were present in these
taxonomies. Instead of a simple boolean question a two-part question was used. Given a
child-parent pair A, B the evaluators were asked two questions:

1. Are the two concepts A and B related? (Yes/No/I don’t know) The evaluators were
asked to judge the relation within the context of the cultural heritage taxonomy. A
positive example was presented: Westminster and London, which were related because
Westminster is in London. A negative example was Fish and Bicycle which were unrelated
and would not be a useful pair to include in a taxonomy.

2. If Yes, then how would you best define the relationship? Is A more specific than B, less
specific than B, neither, or don’t know? Examples were also given to help with this
question. Westminster is more specific than London since Westminster is within London.
The term Scientist is less specific than Physicist, since while all Physicists are Scientists,
not all Scientists are Physicists (they could be biologists or chemists for example). For

Forty non-control pairs from each taxonomy were presented to the evaluators giving a total
of 240 pairs. Examples of concept pairs from each taxonomy are shown in Table 3. As for
the previous experiment control pairs were manually identified where the answer should be
obvious. Five pairs were shown on each page of which one was always a control pair.

Altogether 270 people attempted this survey. 97 people evaluated more than half the control
pairs wrong or evaluated less than 5 pairs in total, and so their answers were excluded. Of the
173 remaining participants, a total of 3826 evaluations were made for each pair. A minimum of
8 evaluations and an average of 15.94 evaluations were made for each instance.

Table 4: Are A and B related?

The results for the relatedness question (Table 4) show a clear pattern. The manually created
taxonomies are markedly more likely to contain clearly related pairs of concepts. The Wikipedia

889



taxonomy hierarchy is the highest performing in this regard which suggests that the user-created
category hierarchy is of high quality and has easily understood concepts and relations. DBpedia
scores slightly lower. This difference might be explained due to DBpedia containing article
entities as well as categories. The lower score suggests either that articles are not always placed
in the best categories, or that it is harder for users to identify article-category relationships.
WordNet domains scores lower. This may be due to the domain concepts being sometimes quite
general and possibly harder for general users to understand (for example one pair of concepts
was ‘color’ and ‘factotum’). LCSH scored surprisingly low considering that it is a manually
created taxonomy. This suggests that the concepts and relations in this hierarchy are even
harder for users to understand or identify. Finally the two data derived taxonomies score lower
still. For the WikiFreq taxonomy a high percentage of the relations were classified as ‘Don’t
know’. This may be because a high number of the article links are about quite obscure concepts
which most people would not know about. Finally the LDA topics produced the highest number
of definite ‘No’ judgements which shows that the taxonomy may be difficult or confusing for
users to navigate.

Table 5: Specificity of the pairs, with A the child node, and B the parent node. A< B means A is
more specific than B.

The results for the specificity question are shown in Table 5. These follow a roughly similar
pattern to the relatedness. The A< B case is the most desirable for the taxonomies since we
would prefer the most general concepts at the top of the hierarchy narrowing down into more
specific concepts. The Wikipedia taxonomy and DBpedia both score relatively highly here,
although both contain a surprisingly high number of cases where neither A or B was identified
as more specific than the other (16.0 and 18.1% respectively). For the Wikipedia taxonomy this
shows that although almost all child-parent pairs are considered to be related concepts, they
are not always easily identified with the child as more specific than the parent. Both WordNet
domains and LCSH fare worse, again with more relations identified as ‘neither’. The WikiFreq
taxonomy contains a more mixed set of results with quite a high proportion of relations the
‘wrong way round’ with A deemed to be less specific than B, although the highest number falls
into the ‘neither’ category. This result is a reflection of the nature of the links within the items.
The taxonomy is ordered with the most frequent occuring links at the top going down towards
the least. Clearly this is not enough to create the kind of general-to-specific relationships which
are desirable. Finally the results for the LDA topics show that the majority are defined as
‘neither’ - the concepts are topically related but mostly without any specificity ordering.

Conclusion and perspectives

Developing effective taxonomies for the purpose of organising large number of data items is a
complex task. Existing manually created taxonomies might be accurate and well structured but
may not be adequate for a specified domain or may be hard for users to navigate. Automatic
methods for deriving taxonomies have the advantage of closely reflecting the nuances of the
data - but organising the derived concepts into meaningful relations remains a problem.

The experiments in this paper shows some surprising results. The LCSH taxonomy has been
manually created for the purpose of organising library collections and so might be the obvious
choice to organise CH data online. However the results show that the relations within LCSH are
defined less clearly than that of the Wikipedia derived taxonomies. WordNet domains performs
at a similar level to the LCSH in terms of the quality of the relations. The LDA topic hierarchy
gave poor results in terms of the identified topics. The topic pairs were often unrelated, and
had no general-to-specific structure as would be desirable for this application.

The WikiFreq hierarchy performed slightly better in this regard. Just over half the concept pairs
were judged to be related. Just under a third were labelled as ‘Don’t know’ which may reflect
the obscurity of the concept nodes identified. It was hoped that organising the frequency counts
of the links would organise the hierarchy into a general-to-specific direction. This was not
achieved, although the hierarchy does have the benefit of providing the user with an overview
of the collection by immediately seeing which kind of items are most prevalent.

In terms of cohesion all the taxonomies achieved similar results except for the WikiFreq
taxonomy which achieved almost perfect cohesion. This shows how effective the Wikipedia
links are in grouping together similar items.

It is also worth noting that WikiFreq and LCSH map significantly fewer items into the taxonomy.

Future work will continue with different evaluation approaches, such as domain/task coverage
and accuracy of the mappings. We also aim to expand the evaluations to include user studies; a
key question is how well these taxonomies assist users when used for browsing large collections,
such as Europeana. The aim is to see if there is a correlation between the intrinsic results that
were found here with the extrinsic quality judgements when used in real life applications. A
promising line of work will be to build on the WikiFreq approach by integrating with the high
quality Wikipedia taxonomy knowledge base. The hope is that using this approach will generate
highly coherent units along with a well structured conceptual tree.
