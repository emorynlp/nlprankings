Abstract

Learning from errors is a crucial aspect of
improving expertise. Based on this no-
tion, we discuss a robust statistical frame-
work for analysing the impact of different
error types on machine translation (MT)
output quality. Our approach is based on
linear mixed-effects models, which allow
the analysis of error-annotated MT out-
put taking into account the variability in-
herent to the specific experimental setting
from which the empirical observations are
drawn. Our experiments are carried out
on different language pairs involving Chi-
nese, Arabic and Russian as target lan-
guages. Interesting findings are reported,
concerning the impact of different error
types both at the level of human perception
of quality and with respect to performance
results measured with automatic metrics.

1 Introduction

The dominant statistical approach to machine
translation (MT) is based on learning from large
amounts of parallel data and tuning the result-
ing models on reference-based metrics that can
be computed automatically, such as BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2001), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,
2005), TER (Snover et al., 2006), GTM (Turian
et al., 2003). Despite the steady progress in the
last two decades, especially for few well resourced
translation directions having English as target lan-
guage, this way to approach the problem is quickly
reaching a performance plateau. One reason is
that parallel data are a source of reliable informa-
tion but, alone, limit systems knowledge to ob-
served positive examples (i.e. how a sentence
should be translated) without explicitly modelling
any notion of error (i.e. how a sentence should
not be translated). Another reason is that, as a

development and evaluation criterion, automatic
metrics provide a holistic view of systems’ be-
haviour without identifying the specific issues of a
translation. Indeed, the global scores returned by
MT evaluation metrics depend on comparisons be-
tween translation hypotheses and reference trans-
lations, where the causes and the nature of the dif-
ferences between them are not identified.

To cope with these issues and define system
improvement priorities, the focus of MT evalua-
tion research is gradually shifting towards profil-
ing systems’ behaviour with respect to various ty-
pologies of errors (Vilar et al., 2006; Popović and
Ney, 2011; Farrús et al., 2012, inter alia). This
shift has enriched the traditional MT evaluation
framework with a new element, that is the actual
errors done by a system. Until now, most of the
research has focused on the relationship (i.e. the
correlation) between two elements of the frame-
work: humans and automatic evaluation metrics.
As a new element of the framework, which be-
comes a sort of “evaluation triangle”, the analy-
sis of error annotations opens interesting research
problems related to the relationships between: i)
error types and human perception of MT quality
and ii) error types and the sensitivity of automatic
metrics.

Besides motivating further investigation on met-
rics featuring high correlation with human judge-
ments (a well-established MT research sub-field,
which is out of the scope of this paper), connecting
the vertices of this triangle raises new challenging
questions such as:
(1) Which types of MT errors have the high-
est impact on human perception of translation
quality? Surprisingly, little prior work focused
on this side of the triangle. Error annotations
have been considered to highlight strengths and
weaknesses of MT engines or to investigate the
influence of different error types on post-editors’
work. However, the direct connection between er-

1643



rors and users’ preferences has been only partially
understood, mainly from a descriptive standpoint
and through rudimentary techniques unsuitable to
draw clear-cut conclusions or reliable inferences.
(2) To which types of errors are different MT
evaluation metrics more sensitive? This side of
the triangle has been even less explored. For in-
stance, little has been done to understand which
automatic metric is more suitable to assess sys-
tem improvements with respect to a specific issue
(e.g. word order or morphology) or to shed light
on the joint impact of different error types on per-
formance results calculated with different metrics.

To answer these questions, we propose a ro-
bust statistical framework to analyse the im-
pact of different error types, alone and in com-
bination, both on human perception of quality and
on MT evaluation metrics’ results. Our analysis
is carried out by employing linear mixed-effects
models, a generalization of linear regression mod-
els suited to model responses with fixed and ran-
dom effects. Experiments are performed on data
covering three translation directions (English to
Chinese, Arabic and Russian). For each direc-
tion, two automatic translations were collected for
around 400 sentences and were manually evalu-
ated by expert translators through absolute quality
judgements and error annotation.

Building on the advantages offered by linear
mixed-effects models, our main contributions in-
clude:

• A rigorous method, novel to MT error anal-
ysis research, to relate MT issues to human
preferences and MT metrics’ results;

• The application of such method to three
translation directions having English as
source and different languages as target;

• A number of findings, specific to each lan-
guage direction, which are out of the reach of
the few simpler methods proposed so far.

Overall, our study has clear practical implica-
tions for MT systems’ development and evalu-
ation. Indeed, the proposed statistical analysis
framework represents an ideal instrument to: i)
identify translation issues having the highest im-
pact on human perception of quality and ii) choose
the most appropriate evaluation metric to measure
progress towards their solution.

2 Related Work

Error analysis, as a way to identify systems’ weak-
nesses and define priorities for their improvement,
is gaining increasing interest in the MT com-
munity (Popović and Ney, 2011; Popovic et al.,
2013). Along this direction, the initial efforts to
develop error taxonomies covering different levels
of granularity (Flanagan, 1994; Vilar et al., 2006;
Farrús Cabeceran et al., 2010; Stymne and Ahren-
berg, 2012; Lommel et al., 2014) have been re-
cently complemented by investigations on how to
exploit error annotations for diagnostic purposes.
Error annotations of sentences produced by differ-
ent MT systems, in different target languages and
domains, have been used to determine the qual-
ity of translations according to the amount of er-
rors encountered (Popovic et al., 2013), to design
new automatic metrics that take into considera-
tion human annotations (Popovic, 2012; Bojar et
al., 2013), and to train classifiers that can auto-
matic identify fine-grained errors in the MT output
(Popović and Ney, 2011). The impact of edit op-
erations on post-editors’ productivity, which im-
plicitly connects the severity of different errors to
human activity, has also been studied (Temnikova,
2010; O’Brien, 2011; Blain et al., 2011), but
few attempts have been made to explicitly model
how fine-grained errors impact on human quality
judgements and automatic metrics.

Recently, the relation between different error
types, their frequency, and human quality judge-
ments has been investigated from a descriptive
standpoint in (Lommel et al., 2014; Popović et al.,
2014). In both works, however, the underlying as-
sumption that the most frequent error has also the
largest impact on quality perception is not verified
(in general and, least of all, across language pairs,
domains, MT systems and post-editors). Another
limitation of the proposed (univariate) analysis lies
in the fact that it exclusively focuses on error types
taken in isolation. This simplification excludes the
possibility that humans, when assigning a global
quality score to a translation, may be influenced
not only by the error types but also by their inter-
action. The implications of such possibility call
for a multivariate analysis capable to model also
error interactions.

In (Kirchhoff et al., 2013), a statistically-
grounded approach based on conjoint analysis has
been used to investigate users’ reactions to dif-
ferent types of translation errors. According to

1644



their results, word order is the most dispreferred
error type, and the count of the errors in a sen-
tence is not a good predictor of users’ prefer-
ences. Though more sophisticated than methods
based on rough error counts, the conjoint model
is bound to several constraints that limit its us-
ability. In particular, the application of conjoint
analysis in this context requires to: i) operate with
semi-automatically created (hence artificial) data
instead of real MT output, ii) manually define dif-
ferent levels of severity for each error type (e.g.
high/medium/low), and iii) limit the number of er-
ror types considered to avoid the explosion of all
possible combinations. Finally, the conjoint anal-
ysis framework is not able to explicitly model vari-
ance in the translated sentences, the human anno-
tators, and the SMT systems used to translate the
source sentences. Our claim is that avoiding any
possible bias introduced by these factors should be
a priority in the analysis of empirical observations
in a given experimental setting.

So far, the relation between errors and auto-
matic metrics has been analysed by measuring the
correlation between single or total error frequen-
cies and automatic scores (Popović and Ney, 2011;
Farrús et al., 2012). Using two different error tax-
onomies, both works show that the sum of the er-
rors has a high correlation with BLEU and TER
scores. Similar to the aforementioned works ad-
dressing the impact of MT errors on human per-
ception, these studies disregard error interactions,
and their possible impact on automatic scores.

To overcome these issues, we propose a ro-
bust statistic analysis framework based on mixed-
effects models, which have been successfully ap-
plied to several NLP problems such as sentiment
analysis (Greene and Resnik, 2009), automatic
speech recognition (Goldwater et al., 2010), and
spoken language translation (Ruiz and Federico,
2014). Despite their effectiveness, the use of
mixed-effects models in the MT field is rather re-
cent and limited to the analysis of human post-
editions (Green et al., 2013; Läubli et al., 2013).
In both studies, the goal was to evaluate the im-
pact of post-editing on the quality and productivity
of human translation assuming an ANOVA mixed
model for a between-subject design, in which hu-
man translators either post-edited or translated the
same texts. Our scenario is rather different as we
employ mixed models to measure the influence of
different MT error types - expressed as continu-

ous fixed effects - on quality judgements and auto-
matic quality metrics. Mixed models, having the
capability to absorb random variability due to the
specific experimental set-up, provide a robust mul-
tivariate method to efficiently analyse the impor-
tance of error types.

Finally, differently from all previous works, our
analysis is run on language pairs having English
as source and languages distant from English (in
term of morphology and word-order) as target.

3 Mixed-effects Models

Mixed-effects models - or simply mixed models
- like any regression model, express the relation-
ship between a response variable and some co-
variates and/or contrast factors. They enhance
conventional models by complementing fixed ef-
fects with so-called random effects. Random ef-
fects are introduced to absorb random variability
inherent to the specific experimental setting from
which the observations are drawn. In general, ran-
dom effects correspond to covariates that are not -
or cannot be - exhaustively observed in an experi-
ment, e.g. the human annotators and the evaluated
systems. Hence, mixed models permit to elegantly
cope with experimental design aspects that hinder
the applicability of conventional regression mod-
els. These are, in particular, the use of repeated
and/or clustered observations that introduce corre-
lations in the response variable that clearly violate
the independence and homoscedasticity assump-
tions of conventional linear, ANOVA, and logis-
tic regression models. Significance testing with
mixed models is in general more powerful, i.e. less
prone to Type II Errors, and also permits to reduce
the chance of Type I Errors in within-subject de-
signs, which are prone to the “fallacy of language-
as-a-fixed-effect” (Clark, 1973).

Random effects can be directly associated to
the regression model parameters, as random in-
tercepts and random slopes, and have the same
form of the generic error component of the model,
i.e. normally distributed with zero mean and un-
known variance. As random effects introduce hid-
den variables, mixed models are trained with Ex-
pectation Maximization, while significance testing
is performed via likelihood-ratio (LR) tests.

In this work we employ mixed linear models to
measure the influence of different MT error types,
expressed as continuous fixed effects, on quality

judgements or on automatic quality metrics.1

We illustrate mixed linear models (Baayen et
al., 2008) by referring to our analysis, which ad-
dresses the relationships between a quality metric
(y) and different types of errors (e.g. A, B, and
C)2 observed at the sentence level. For the sake of
simplicity, we assume to have balanced repeated
observations for one single crossed effect. That is,
we have i ∈ {1, . . . , I} MT systems (our groups)
each of which translated the same j ∈ {1, . . . , J}
test sentences. Our response variable yij - a nu-
meric quality score - is computed on each (sen-
tence, system) pair, and we aim to investigate its
relationship with error statistics available for each
MT output, namely Aij , Bij and Cij . A (possible)
linear mixed model for our study would be:

yij = β0 + β1 Aij + β2 Bij + β3 Cij + (1)
b0,i + b1,iAij + b2,iBij + b3,iCi + �ij

The model is split into two lines on purpose. The
first line shows the fixed effect component, that is
intercept (β0) and slopes (β1, β2, β3) for each error
type. The second line specifies the random struc-
ture of the model, which includes random inter-
cept and slopes for each MT system and the resid-
ual error. Borrowing the notation from (Green
et al., 2013), we conveniently rewrite (1) in the
group-wise arranged matrix notation:

yi = xTi β + z
T
i bi + �i (2)

where yi is the J × 1 vector of responses, xi is the
J×p design matrix of covariates (including the in-
tercept) with fixed coefficients β ∈ Rp×1, z is the
random structure matrix defined by J × q covari-
ates with random coefficients bi ∈ Rq×1, and �i is
the vector of residuals (in our example, p = 4 and
q = 4). By packing together vectors and matrices
indexed over groups i, we can rewrite the model
in a general form (Baayen et al., 2008), which can
represent any possible crossed-effects and random
structures defined over them allowing, at the same
time, for a compact model specification:

y = XTβ + ZT b+ � (3)
� ∼ N (0, σ2I), b ∼ N (0, σ2Σ), b ⊥ �

1Although mixed ordinal models (Tutz and Hennevogl,
1996) are in principle more appropriate to target quality
judgements, in our preliminary investigations mixed linear
models showed a significantly higher predictive power.

2Here, A, B and C represent three generic error classes.
Their actual number in a given experimental setting will de-
pend on the granularity of the reference error taxonomy.

where Σ is the relative variance-covariance q × q
matrix of the random effects (now q = 4I), σ2

is the variance of the per-observation term �, the
symbol ⊥ denotes independence of random vari-
ables, andN indicates the multivariate normal dis-
tribution. While b, σ, and Σ are estimated via max-
imum likelihood, the single random intercept and
slope values for each group are calculated subse-
quently. They are referred to as Best Linear Un-
biased Predictors (BLUPS) and, formally, are not
parameters of the model.

The significance of the contribution of each sin-
gle parameter (e.g. single entries of Σ) to the
goodness of fit can be tested via likelihood ratio.
In this way, both the fixed and random effect struc-
ture of the model can be investigated with respect
to its actual necessity to the model.

4 Dataset

For our analysis we used a dataset that covers
three translation directions, corresponding to En-
glish to Chinese, Arabic, and Russian. An inter-
national organization provided us a set of English
sentences together with their translation produced
by two anonymous MT systems. For each evalu-
ation item (source sentence and two MT outputs)
three experts were asked to assign quality scores to
the MT outputs, and a fourth expert was asked to
annotate translation errors. The four experts, who
were all professional translators native in the ex-
amined target languages, were carefully trained to
get acquainted with the evaluation guidelines and
the annotation tool specifically developed for these
evaluation tasks (Girardi et al., 2014). The anno-
tation process was carried out in parallel by all an-
notators over one week, resulting in a final dataset
composed of 312 evaluation items for the ENZH
direction, 393 for ENAR, and 437 for ENRU.

4.1 Quality Judgements

Quality judgements were collected by asking the
three experts to rate each automatic translation
according to a 1-5 Likert scale, where 1 means
“incomprehensible translation” and 5 means “per-
fect translation”. The distribution of the collected
annotations with respect to each quality score is
shown in Figure 1. As we can see, this distri-
bution reflects different levels of perceived qual-
ity across languages. ENZH, for instance, has the
highest number of low quality scores (1 and 2),
while ENRU has the highest number of high qual-

ity scores (4 and 5).
Table 1 shows the average of all the qual-

ity scores assigned by each annototator as well
as the average score obtained for each MT sys-
tem. These values demonstrate the variability
of annotators and systems. A particularly high
variability among human judges is observed for
the ENAR language direction (also reflected by
the inter-annotator agreement scores discussed be-
low), while ENZH shows the highest variability
between systems. As we will see in §5.1, we suc-
cessfully cope with this variability by considering
systems and annotators as random effects, which
allow the regression models to abstract from these
differences.

Table 1: Average quality scores per annotator and

Inter-annotator agreement was computed using
the Fleiss’ kappa coefficient (Fleiss, 1971), and re-
sulted in 22.70% for ENZH, 5.24% for ENAR, and
21.80% for ENRU. While for ENZH and ENRU
the results fall in the range of “fair” agreement
(Landis and Koch, 1977), for ENAR only “slight”
agreement is reached, reflecting the higher anno-
tators’ variability evidenced in Table 1.

A more fine-grained agreement analysis is pre-
sented in Figure 2, where the kappa values are
given for each score class. In general we no-
tice a lower agreement on the intermediate quality
scores, while annotators tend to agree on very bad
and, even more, on good translations. In partic-
ular, we see that the agreement for ENAR is sys-
tematically lower than the values measured for the
other languages on all the score classes.

4.2 Error Annotation

This evaluation task was carried out by one ex-
pert for each language direction, who was asked to
identify the type of errors present in the MT output
and to mark their position in the text. Since the fo-
cus of our work is the analysis method rather than
the definition of an ideal error taxonomy, for the
difficult language directions addressed we opted
for the following general error classes, partially
overlapping with (Vilar et al., 2006): i) reordering
errors, ii) lexicon errors (including wrong lexical
choices and extra words), iii) missing words, iv)
morphology errors.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the errors in
terms of affected tokens (words) for each error
type. Since token counts for Chinese are not word-
based but character-based, for readability purposes
the number of errors counted for Chinese trans-
lations have been divided by 2.5. Note also that
morphological errors annotated for ENZH involve
only 13 characters and thus are not visible in the
plot. The total number of errors amounts to 16,320
characters for ENZH, 4,926 words for ENAR, and
5,965 words for ENRU.

This distribution highlights some differences
between languages directions. For example, trans-
lations into Arabic and Russian present several
morphology errors, while word reordering is the
most frequent issue for translations into Chinese.
As we will see in §5.1, error frequency does not
give a direct indication of their impact on trasla-
tion quality judgements.

4.3 Automatic Metrics

In our investigation we consider three popular au-
tomatic metrics: sentence-level BLEU (Lin and
Och, 2004), TER (Snover et al., 2006), and GTM
(Turian et al., 2003). We compute all automatic
scores by relying on a single reference and by

means of standard packages. In particular, auto-
matic scores on Chinese are computed at the char-
acter level. Moreover, as we use metrics as re-
sponse variables for our regression models, we
compute all metrics at the sentence level. The
overall mean scores for all systems and languages
are reported in Table 2. Differences in systems’
performance can be observed for all language
pairs; as we will observe in §5.2 such variability
explains the effectiveness of considering the MT
systems as a random effect.

5 Experiments

To assess the impact of translation errors on MT
quality we perform two sets of experiments. The
first set (§5.1) addresses the relation between er-
rors and human quality judgements. The sec-
ond set (§5.2) focuses on the relation between er-
rors and automatic metrics. In both cases, be-
fore measuring the impact of different errors on
the response variable (respectively quality judge-
ments and metrics), we validate the effectiveness
of mixed linear models by comparing their predic-
tion capability with other methods.

In all experiments, error counts of each category
were normalized into percentages with respect to
the sentence length and mapped in a logarithmic
scale. In this way, we basically assume that the
impact of errors tends to saturate above a given
threshold, hypothesis that also results in better fits
by our models.3 Notice that while the chosen log-

3In other words, we assume that human sensitivity to er-

10 base is easy to interpret, linear models can im-
plicitly adjust it. Our analysis makes use of mixed
linear models incorporating, as fixed effects, the
four types of errors (lex, miss, morph and reo) and
their pairwise interactions (the product of the sin-
gle error log counts), while their random struc-
ture depends on each specific experiment. For
the experiments we rely on the R language (R
Core Team, 2013) implementation of linear mixed
model in the lme4 library (Bates et al., 2014).

We assess the quality of our mixed linear mod-
els (MLM) by comparing their prediction capabil-
ity with a sequence of simpler linear models in-
cluding only fixed effects. In particular, we built
five univariate models and two multivariate mod-
els. The univariate models use as covariates, re-
spectively, the sum of all error types (baseline),
and each of the four types of errors (lex, miss,
morph and reo). The two multivariate models in-
clude all the four error types, considering them
without interactions (FLM w/o Interact.) and with
interactions (FLM).

Prediction performance is computed in terms of
Mean Absolute Error (MAE),4 which we estimate
by averaging over 1,000 random splits of the data
in 90% training and 10% test. In particular, for the
human quality classes we pick the integer between
1-5 that is closest to the predicted value.

5.1 Errors vs. Quality Judgements

The response variable we target in this experiment
is the quality score produced by human annotators.
Our measurements follow a typical within-subject
design in which all the 3 annotators are exposed
to the same conditions (levels of the independent
variables), corresponding in our case to perfectly
balanced observations from 2 MT systems and N
sentences. This setting results in repeated or clus-
tered observations (thus violating independence)
corresponding to groups which naturally identify
possible random effects,5 namely the annotators
(3 levels with 2xN observations each), the systems
(2 levels and 3xN observations each), and the sen-

rors follows a log-scale law: e.g. more sensitive to variations
in the interval [1-10] that in the interval [30-40].

4MAE is calculated as the average of the absolute errors
|fi − yi|, where fi is the prediction of the model and yi the
true value for the ith instance. As it is a measure of error,
lower MAE scores indicate that our predictions are closer to
the true values of each test instance.

5In all our experiments, random effects are limited to ran-
dom shifts since preliminary experiments also including ran-
dom slopes did not provide consistent results.

tences (N levels with 6 observations each). In prin-
ciple, such random effects permit to remove sys-
tematic biases of individual annotators, single sys-
tems and even single sentences, which are mod-
elled as random variables sampled from distinct
populations.

Table 3 shows a comparison of the prediction
capability of the mixed model6 with simpler ap-
proaches. While the good performance achieved
by our strong baseline cannot be outperformed
by separately counting the number of errors of a
single type, lower MAE results are obtained by
methods based on multivariate analysis. Among
them, FLM brings the first consistent improve-
ments over the baseline by considering error in-
teractions, while MLM leads to the lowest MAE
due to the addition of random effects. The impor-
tance of random effects is particularly evidenced
by ENAR (12 points below the baseline). Indeed,
as discussed in §4.1, for this language combina-
tion human annotators show the lowest agreement
score. This variability, which hides the smaller
differences in systems’ behaviour, demonstrates
the importance of accounting for the erratic fac-
tors that might influence empirical observations in
a given setting. The good performance achieved
by MLM, combined with their high descriptive
power,7 motivates their adoption in our study.

Concerning the analysis of error impact, Ta-
ble 4 shows the statistically significant coefficients
for the full-fledged MLM models for each trans-
lation direction. By default, all reported coeffi-
cients have p-values ≤ 10−4, while those marked
with • and ◦ have respectively p-values ≤ 10−3
and ≤ 10−2. Slope coefficients basically show

6Note that the mixed model used in prediction does not in-
clude the random effect on sentences since the training sam-
ples do not guarantee sufficient observations for each test sen-
tence.

7Note that the strong baseline used for comparison is not
capable to describe the contribution of the different error

the impact of different error types (alone and in
combination) on human quality scores. Those that
are not statistically significant are omitted as they
do not increase the fitting capability of our model.
As can be seen from the table, such impact varies
across the different language combinations. While
for ENZH and ENRU miss is the error having
the highest impact (highest decrement with respect
to the intercept), the most problematic error for
ENAR is lex. It is interesting to observe that pos-
itive values for error combinations indicate that
their combined impact is lower that the sum of the
impact of the single errors. For instance, while for
ENZH a one-step increment in lex and miss errors
would respectively cause a reduction in the human
judgement of 1.27 and 1.76, their occurrence in
the same sentence would be discounted by 1.00.
This would result in a global judgement of 2.26
(4.29 -1.27 -1.76 +1.00) instead of 1.26. While
for ENAR this phenomenon can be observed for
all error combinations, such discount effects are
not always significant for the other two language
pairs. The existence of discount effects of various
magnitude associated to the different error com-
binations is a novel finding made possible by the
adoption of mixed-effect models.

Another interesting observation is that, in con-
trast with the common belief that the most fre-
quent errors have the highest impact on human
quality judgements, our experiments do not re-
veal such strict correlation (at least for the exam-
ined language pairs). For instance, for ENZH and
ENRU the impact of miss errors is higher than the
impact of other more frequent issues.

5.2 Errors vs. Automatic Metrics

In this experiment, the response variable is an au-
tomatic metric which is computed on a sample of
MT outputs (which are again perfectly balanced
over systems and sentences) and a set of reference
translations. As no subjects are involved in the ex-
periment, random variability is assumed to come
from the involved systems, the tested sentences,
and the unknown missing link between the covari-
ates (error types) and the response variable which
is modelled by the residual noise. Notice that,
in this case, the random effect on the sentences
also incorporates in some sense the randomness
of the corresponding reference translations, which
are themselves representatives of larger samples.

The prediction capability of the mixed model,
in comparison with the simpler ones, is reported
in Table 5. Also in this case, the low MAE
achieved by the baseline is out of the reach of uni-
variate methods. Again, small improvements are
brought by FLM when considering error interac-
tions, whereas the most visible gains are achieved
by MLM due to their control of random effects.
This is more evident for some language combina-
tions and can be explained by the differences in
systems’ performance, a variability factor easily
absorbed by random effects. Indeed, the largest
MAE decrements over the baseline are always ob-
served for ENZH (for which the overall mean re-
sults reported in Table 2 show the largest dif-
ferences) and the smallest decrements relate to
language/metric combinations where systems’ be-
haviour is more similar (e.g. ENRU/GTM).

Concerning the analysis of error impact, Table
6 shows how different error types (alone and in
combination) influence performance results mea-
sured with automatic metrics. To ease interpre-
tation of the reported figures we also show Pear-
son and Spearman correlations of each set of coef-
ficients (excluding intercept estimates) with their

corresponding coefficients reported in Table 4. In
fact, our primary interest in this experiment is to
see which metrics show a sensitivity to specific er-
ror types similar to human perception. As we can
see, the coefficients for each metric significantly
vary depending on the language, for the simple
reason that also the distribution and co-occurrence
of errors vary significantly across the different lan-
guages and MT systems. Remarkably, for some
translation directions, some of the metrics show
a sensitivity to errors that is very similar to that
of human judges. In particular, BLEU for ENZH
and ENAR, and GTM for ENZH show a very high
correlation with the human sensitivity to transla-
tion errors, with Pearson correlation coefficient ≥
0.97. For ENRU, the best Pearson correlation is
instead achieved by TER (-0.78).

Besides these general observations, a closer
look at the reported scores brings additional find-
ings. In three cases (BLEU for ENZH, GTM for
ENZH and ENAR) the analysed metrics are most
sensitive to the same error type that has the high-
est influence on human judgements (according to
Table 4, these are miss for ENZH and ENRU, lex
for ENAR). On the contrary, in one case (TER for
ENZH) the analysed metric is insensitive to the er-
ror type (miss) which has the highest impact on hu-
man quality scores. From a practical point of view,
these remarks provide useful indications about the
appropriateness of each metric to highlight the de-
ficiencies of a specific system and to measure im-
provements targeting specific issues. As a rule of
thumb, for instance, to measure improvements of
an ENZH system with respect to missing words,
it would be more advisable to use BLEU or GTM
instead of TER.8

8Note that this conclusion holds for our data sample, in
which different types of errors co-occur and only one refer-
ence translation is available. In such conditions, our regres-
sion model shows that TER is not influenced by miss errors in
a statistically significant way. This does not mean that TER
is insensitive to missing words when occurring in isolation,

Table 6: Effect of translation errors on BLEU score, TER and GTM on all judged sentences and correla-
tion with their corresponding effects on human quality scores (from Table 4). Reported coefficients (β)
are statistically significant with p ≤ 10−4, except those marked with • (p ≤ 10−3), ◦ (p ≤ 10−2) and
2(p ≤ 10−1).

Similar considerations also apply to the analysis
of the impact of error combinations. The same dis-
count effects that we noticed when analysing the
impact of errors’ co-occurrence on human percep-
tion (§5.1) are evidenced, with different degrees of
sensitivity, by the automatic metrics. While some
of them substantially reflect human response (e.g.
BLEU and GTM for ENZH), in some cases we
observe either the insensitivity to specific combi-
nations (mostly for ENAR), or a higher sensitivity
compared to the values measured for human as-
sessors (mostly for ENRU, where the impact of
miss:reo combinations is discounted - hence un-
derestimated - by all the metrics).

Despite such small differences, the coherence of
our results with previous findings (§5.1) suggests
the reliability of the applied method. Complet-
ing the picture along the side of the MT evalua-
tion triangle which connects error annotations and
automatic metrics, our findings contribute to shed
light on the existing relationships between transla-
tion errors, their interaction, and the sensitivity of
widely used automatic metrics.

6 Conclusion

We investigated the MT evaluation triangle (hav-
ing as corners automatic metrics, human quality
judgements and error annotations) along the two
less explored sides, namely: i) the relation be-
tween MT errors and human quality judgements

but that TER becomes less sensitive to such errors when they
co-occur with other types of errors. Overall, our experiments
show that when MT outputs contain more than one error type,
automatic metrics show different levels of sensitivity to each
specific error type.

and ii) the relation between MT errors and auto-
matic metrics. To this aim we employed a ro-
bust statistical analysis framework based on lin-
ear mixed-effects models (the first contribution of
the paper), which have a higher descriptive power
than simpler methods based on the raw count of
translation errors and are less artificial compared
to previous statistically-grounded approaches.

Working on three translation directions having
Chinese, Arabic and Russian as target (our second
contribution), we analysed error-annotated trans-
lations considering the impact of specific errors
(alone and in combination) and accounting for the
variability of the experimental set-up that origi-
nated our empirical observations. This led us to
interesting findings specific to each language pair
(third contribution). Concerning the relation be-
tween MT errors and quality judgements, we have
shown that: i) the frequency of errors of a given
type does not correlate with human preferences,
ii) errors having the highest impact can be pre-
cisely isolated and iii) the impact of error inter-
actions is often subject to measurable and previ-
ously unknown “discount” effects. Concerning the
relation between MT errors and automatic met-
rics (BLEU, TER and GTM), our analysis evi-
denced significant differences in the sensitivity of
each metric to different error types. Such differ-
ences provide useful indications about the most
appropriate metric to assess system improvements
with respect to specific weaknesses. If learning
from errors is a crucial aspect of improving exper-
tise, our method and the resulting empirical find-
ings represent a significant contribution towards a

more informed approach to system development,
improvement and evaluation.
