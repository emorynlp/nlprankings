Abstract 

Personal Attributes Extraction in Unstructured Chinese 

Text Task is a subtask of The 3rd CIPS-SIGHAN Joint 

Conference on Chinese Language Processing 

(CLP-2014). In this report, we propose a method based 

on the combination of trigger words, dictionary and 

rules to realize the personal attributes extraction. We 

introduce the extraction process and show the result of 

this bakeoff, which can show that   our method is 

feasible and has achieved good effect. 

Keywords: Unstructured Chinese Text, Personal 

Attributes Extraction, Trigger Words, Dictionary, Rules 

1 Introduction 

In recent years, with the development of Internet, masses 

of information provide the majority of Internet users 

with a lot of convenience. However, with the increase of 

amount of information, screening redundant information 

and seeking for the knowledge which users really want 

from a lot of unstructured texts is getting more and more 

difficult. For example, when we search for the details of 

someone, general search engines usually return a 

number of pages, and we must identify these pages one 

by one even if we just need a little of them. Therefore, 

extracting personal attributes from unstructured texts has 

become a very important task. Personal attributes 

extraction in unstructured Chinese text task is designed 

to extract person specific attributes, such as date of birth, 

spouse, husband, children, education, or title etc. from 

unstructured Chinese texts. The corresponding 

techniques play an important role in information 

extraction, event tracking, entity disambiguation and 

other related research areas. 

In our report, a method based on the combination of 

trigger words, dictionary and rules to realize the 

personal attributes extraction is introduced. We build a 

basic framework including trigger words, dictionaries 

and rules that relative to the task to extract personal 

specific attributes. In Section 2, we introduce two basic 

methods about information extraction and several recent 

researches on this theme while the detailed description 

of the task is represented in Section 3. In Section 4, we 

give the step to build our basic model of extraction. We 

talk the main framework in Section 4.1. Then from 

Section 4.2 to Section 4.4, we describe the process to 

build trigger word table, attribute dictionaries and 

personal attribute rules one by one in a detailed way. We 

show the evaluation metrics and the final experiment 

results in Section 5 to prove the feasibility of our method. 

In Section 6, we point out the shortage of our system and 

propose some suggestions to improve our model and 

then make a conclusion. 

2 Related Works 

Rule-based methods and statistics-based ones are two 

main ways of information extraction at present. 

Information extraction based on the rules is a two phase 

process consists of learning and applying, including the 

study of rules and the application of using rules for 

target information extraction. Information extraction 

rules mainly come from the target context in constraint 

environment. As long as finding the constraint 

information which can meet the rules in the text, we 

could also find the target extraction information. Thus, 

learning and extracting the rules themselves becomes the 

key point to the rule-based information extraction. As 

for the method of statistics-based, its accuracy is 

generally low, but it has good portability to this 

extraction problem. Some statistics models have strong 

statistical theory basis and wholesome training 

algorithms such as HMM and CRFs and so on. However, 

statistics-based information extraction requires a large 

amount of labeled training data. 

Currently, there are not many references about the 

personal attributes extraction and there is no more 

mature system to solve this problem. However, personal 

attributes extraction has a very close relation to the 

information extraction, and personal entities also belong 

to the category of the entity. So, to a certain extent, the 

entity relation extraction method can also be applied to 

personal attribute extraction. Ye [1] and some other 

researchers treated the personal attribute extraction as a 

specific application in the entity relationship extraction. 

They use the “Hownet” to acquire the trigger words 

which can describe the personal attributes, then change 

the relationship between trigger words and names into a 

classification problem. Their solution needs manual 

114



 

 

labeled data during classifier training and is under the 

help of semantic resource. Wang [2] and some other 

researchers put forward a relationship judgment 

algorithm which is based on the semantic similarity 

between the current tuples and the relationship set to 

filter and classify the relational tuples that are extracted 

according to the pattern, using Wikipedia as a 

knowledge database. This is under the foundation of 

extraction model of sentence groups such as blocks and 

named entity recognition marker. Wang [3] and others 

tried to use the method of knowledge engineering to 

extract personal attributes. They sum up some rules 

manually under the foundation of mass analysis about 

web texts and researches in natural language processing 

and then built a pattern repository to do the match. Yu [4] 

adopted the way of using trigger words and classifier to 

exact personal basic information, and carried out a 

character search engine based on the stored exaction 

information. 

3 Task Descriptions  

In this task, there are 25 predefined personal attributes to 

be extracted, including alternate_names, date_of_birth, 

age, country_of_birth, stateorprovince_of_birth, 

city_of_birth, date_of_death, country_of_death, 

stateorprovince_of_death, city_of_death, 

coutriea_of_residence, stateorprovince_of_residence, 

cities_of_residence, title, member_of, employee_of, 

religion, spouse, children, parents, siblings, other_family, 

charges, cause_of_death and schools_attended. The 

testing data are provided by a series of folders which are 

named after people whose attributes need to be extracted. 

In each folder, a XML document of Wikipedia and some 

unstructured Chinese texts about the person are included. 

Except for the actual attribute values, the extraction 

results should also contain the source documents that the 

values come from and their positions in the documents. 

For the attributes that are already located in the tags of 

“Facts” in the document of Wikipedia, we do not need to 

extract them repeatedly. For those attributes whose 

values are not unique, such as parents, children and the 

residence of cities, it is responsible for us to extract all 

probable attribute values. 

4 Methods  

Before the selection of methods to extract, we’ve 

analyzed the attributes to be extracted, the sample data 

and also the testing data provided by the conference 

carefully. Because we don't have enough data as the 

training data, and it requires quantities of work to collect 

and label the training data artificially, we gave up the 

extraction method based on statistics. While, through the 

observation of a large number of Wikipedia pages and 

personal information, we found that most of the 

attributes have a great similarity in the expression and 

discipline. Therefore, what we use is a method that 

combines the trigger words, dictionaries and rules 

together to achieve the task of personal attributes 

extraction. 

 

4.1 Basic Framework 

As shown in Figure 1, the architecture includes several 

parts:  

1. The test corpus is provided by the conference. The 

corpus includes several XML files about persons whose 

personal attributes are to be extracted, containing the 

persons’ Wikipedia records, and a number of 

unstructured documents relating to the persons.  

2. Build attributes trigger words. The trigger words are 

aimed to narrow down the extraction scope, such as birth 

date and place of birth appears in sentences containing 

“出生”(birth) or “生于”(born).  

3. Build attributes dictionary. The dictionary is in the 

view of the state, province, and school, the cause of 

death and some similar fixed attributes or some 

attributes which could be extracted by dictionary lookup 

directly.  

4. Build attributes extraction rules. We sum up the 

general characteristics of the attributes from the corpus 

using the combination features of word segmentation, 

part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition 

(NER) and sentence parsing. Then we formulate the 

rules of grammar corresponding to these characteristics 

respectively. As a result, we can use these rules in the 

process of personal attributes extraction respectively.  

5. Extract the attributes information. Extract attributes 

from the input unstructured documents according to the 

rules and structure of the dictionary. 

 

Figure 1 System Framework 

4.2 Build Trigger word Table 

So-called trigger word refers to a particular attribute 

extraction having the effect of location and identification 

that can activate the extraction task. When a sentence 

contains trigger words in a certain document, it could 

trigger the corresponding attribute extraction task in the 

sentence, so that the scope of the attribute extraction 

would be greatly narrowed. In this work, by analyzing 

the text characteristic and the description of the Chinese 

language style, we built trigger word sets for part of the 

corresponding attributes, while the attributes without 

trigger words require full range extraction in document. 

Trigger word table is shown in Table 1.

4.3 Build Attribute Dictionary 

We built attribute dictionary aiming at national, 

provincial or state, city, school, etc. for those attributes, 

which can be extracted directly by dictionary lookup. 

Compared to the rules, dictionary extraction is more 

convenient and with higher accuracy. For part of 

attributes, we built 8 dictionaries referring to the country, 

school, religion etc., as shown in Table 2.

4.4 Build Personal Attribute Rules 

Rules are very important for the proposed personal 

attributes information extraction. Its quality directly 

decides the effect of information extraction. While we 

were studying the personal attributes, we found that the 

expression of same attributes have a lot of similarities. 

Based on the similarity, in combination with word 

segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity 

recognition, we built rules for each corresponding 

attribute. Rule sets are shown in Table 3. 

Table 3 Rules of Personal Attributes Extraction

5 Experiments 

This work is designed to extract person specific 

attributes from unstructured Chinese texts. The testing 

date contains 323 documents about 90 persons, 

including 233 documents to extract attributes and 90 

documents from Wikipedia records. The organizer of 

Personal Attributes Extraction in Unstructured Chinese 

Text Subtask of The 3rd CIPS-SIGHAN Joint 

Conference on Chinese Language Processing 

(CLP-2014) takes the same evaluation metrics adopted 

in the slot filling of TAC KBP. Deails of the result is 

presented in [5]. 

Single attributes evaluation metric 

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 =
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡

𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑡
 

When NumCorrect is zero, we set NumCorrect to 1.0; 

List attributes evaluation metric 

𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 =
(𝐹𝛽

2 + 1) ∗ 𝐼𝑃 ∗ 𝐼𝑅

𝐹𝛽
2 ∗ (𝐼𝑃 + 𝐼𝑅)

 

𝐹𝛽 = 2 𝑡𝑜 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 

𝐼𝑃 = 𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 
𝐼𝑅 = 𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 

𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡 =
∑ 𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒

𝑁𝑢𝑚𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑆𝑙𝑜𝑡𝑠
 

When both IP and IR are zero, we set ListSlotValue to 

0.0; 

Overall evaluation metric 

𝑆𝐹𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 =
1

2
(𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 +  𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑠𝑡) 

We use the average of single attributes evaluation score 

and list attributes evaluation score as the final evaluation 

score. In the evaluation, both the lenient evaluation and 

strict evaluation are performed. In the strict evaluation, 

all instance attributes are compared to the answers while 

in the lenient evaluation, the offsets of the string from 

the beginning word to the ending word are ignored. 

Table 4 and Table 5 give the results for lenient 

evaluation and strict evaluation, respectively. Note that 

there are 6 teams participated in this bakeoff, as shown 

in the first column of Table 4 and Table 5, in which our 

team is called CIST-BUPT.

We can see that our method has achieved good results, 

ranking the second place in the six teams. The results 

fully show that the method based on the combination of 

118



 

 

trigger words, dictionary and rules is feasible to some 

extent, and the trigger words and rules we formulated 

have performed well. 

But there are still some problems in our method. The list 

attributes evaluation score is far lower than the single 

attributes evaluation score, which shows that we 

possibly have missed a lot of instances. And when 

considering the offsets of the extracted string, both the 

single attribute and list attributes evaluation score 

declined. This indicates that there are some errors, for 

example, the attribute value is correct but the source or 

object is wrong. In future work, we need to develop 

special improved strategies to extract more accurate 

results. 

6 Conclusions and Future Work 

In this report, we proposed a method based on the 

combination of trigger words, dictionary and rules to 

extract person specific attributes from unstructured 

Chinese texts. The trigger words can narrow the scope of 

extraction and then they are combined with specific 

dictionary lookup and extraction rules to implement the 

extraction of 25 person specific attributes. 

Given the limited time and the first try in this kind of 

bakeoff, our system still has some shortages to be 

improved. For example, in the case of “Missing Words”, 

we can specify the rules or collect and tag data 

artificially in order to get more training data and then 

use the method of machine learning to extract person 

attributes. On the other hand, to improve the case of 

“Incorrect Words”, we plan to increase the judgment of 

the subject in one sentence so that we can avoid the 

situation that the attributes we extract belong to other 

people. Otherwise, we can also try to make more 

specific rules for the place names which occurs in 

schools or organizations to reduce their effects to those 

related attributes about place.  

We believe that if we do some improvements to our 

system as above, we can get a more accurate extraction 

result. And we are also looking forward to developing 

more formal and more relatively complete machine 

learning algorithms and rules to realize the extraction of 

person specific attributes in unstructured Chinese with 

less human labor in the loop.
