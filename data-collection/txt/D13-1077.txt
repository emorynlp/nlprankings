Abstract

Recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due
to the wide variation within the phenomenon,
the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface
markers and their relative rarity. We develop
linguistically motivated discourse structure,
lexico-semantic and genericity detection fea-
tures and integrate these into a cascaded mi-
nority preference algorithm that models bridg-
ing recognition as a subtask of learning fine-
grained information status (IS). We substan-
tially improve bridging recognition without
impairing performance on other IS classes.

1 Introduction

In bridging or associative anaphora (Clark, 1975;
Prince, 1981; Gundel et al., 1993), the antecedent
and anaphor are not coreferent but are linked via a
variety of contiguity relations.1 In Example 1, the
phrases a resident, the stairs and the lobby are bridg-
ing anaphors with the antecedent One building.2

(1) One building was upgraded to red status while peo-
ple were taking things out, and a resident called up the
stairs to his girlfriend, telling her to keep sending things
down to the lobby.

Bridging is an important problem as it affects lin-
guistic theory and applications alike. For exam-
ple, without bridging resolution, entity coherence
between the first and second coordinated clause in

1We exclude comparative anaphora where anaphor and an-
tecedent are in a similarity/exclusion relation, indicated by ana-
phor modifiers such as other or similar (Modjeska et al., 2003).

2Examples are from OntoNotes (Weischedel et al., 2011).
Bridging anaphora are set in boldface; antecedents in italics.

Example 1 cannot be established. This is a prob-
lem both for coherence theories such as Centering
(Grosz et al., 1995) (where bridging is therefore in-
corporated as an indirect realization of previous en-
tities) as well as applications relying on entity co-
herence modelling, such as readability assessment
or sentence ordering (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).

Full bridging resolution needs (i) recognition that
a bridging anaphor is present and (ii) identification
of the antecedent and contiguity relation. In re-
cent work, these two tasks have been tackled sep-
arately, with bridging recognition handled as part of
information status (IS) classification (Markert et al.,
2012; Cahill and Riester, 2012; Rahman and Ng,
2012). Each mention in a text gets assigned one IS
class that describes its accessibility to the reader at
a given point in a text, bridging being one possible
class. We stay within this framework.

Bridging recognition is a difficult task, so that we
had to report very low results on this IS class in pre-
vious work (Markert et al., 2012). This is due to the
phenomenon’s variety, leading to a lack of clear sur-
face features for recognition. Instead, we formulate
in this paper novel discourse structure and lexico-
semantic features as well as features that distinguish
bridging from generics (see Section 3). In addition,
making up between 5% and 20% of definite descrip-
tions (Gardent and Manuélian, 2005; Caselli and
Prodanof, 2006) and around 6% of all NPs (Mark-
ert et al., 2012), bridging is still less frequent than
many other IS classes and recognition of minority
classes is well known to be more difficult. We there-
fore use a cascaded classification algorithm to ad-
dress this problem (Omuya et al., 2013).

2 Related Work

Most bridging research concentrates on antecedent
selection only (Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Poesio et
al., 2004a; Markert et al., 2003; Lassalle and De-
nis, 2011; Hou et al., 2013), assuming that bridg-
ing recognition has already been performed. Previ-
ous work on recognition is either limited to definite
NPs based on heuristics evaluated on small datasets
(Hahn et al., 1996; Vieira and Poesio, 2000), or
models it as a subtask of learning fine-grained IS
(Rahman and Ng, 2012; Markert et al., 2012; Cahill
and Riester, 2012). Results within this latter frame-
work for bridging have been mixed: We reported in
Markert et al. (2012) low results for bridging in writ-
ten news text whereas Rahman and Ng (2012) re-
port high results for the four subcategories of bridg-
ing annotated in the Switchboard dialogue corpus by
Nissim et al. (2004). We believe this discrepancy to
be due to differences in corpus size and genre as well
as in bridging definition. Bridging in Switchboard
includes non-anaphoric, syntactically linked part-of
and set-member relationships (such as the building’s
lobby), as well as comparative anaphora, the latter
being marked by surface indicators such as other,
another etc. Both types are much easier to identify
than anaphoric bridging cases.3 In addition, many
non-anaphoric lexical cohesion cases have been an-
notated as bridging in Switchbard as well.

We also separate bridging recognition and ante-
cedent selection. One could argue that a joint model
is more attractive as potential antecedents such as
building “trigger” subsequent bridging cases such as
stairs (Example 1). However, bridging can be indi-
cated by referential patterns without world knowl-
edge about the anaphor/antecedent NPs, as the non-
sense example 2 shows: the wug is clearly a bridging
anaphor although we do not know the antecedent.4

(2) The blicket couldn’t be connected to the dax. The
wug failed.

Similarly, Clark (1975) distinguishes between
bridging via necessary, probable and inducible
parts/roles and argues that only in the first and
maybe the second case the antecedent triggers the

parative anaphora (Markert et al., 2012).

bridging anaphor in the sense that we already spon-
taneously think of the anaphor when we read the an-
tecedent. Also, bridging recognition on its own can
be valuable for applications: for example, prosody is
influenced by IS status without needing antecedent
knowledge (Baumann and Riester, 2013).

3 Characterizing Bridging Anaphora for
Automatic Recognition

3.1 Properties of bridging anaphora
Bridging anaphors are rarely marked by surface fea-
tures. Indeed, even the common practice (Vieira and
Poesio, 2000; Lassalle and Denis, 2011; Cahill and
Riester, 2012) to limit bridging to definite NPs does
not seem to be correct: We report in previous work
(Hou et al., 2013) that less than 40% of the bridg-
ing anaphora in our corpus are definites. Instead,
bridging is diverse with regard to syntactic form
and function: bridging anaphora can be definite NPs
(Examples 4 and 6), indefinite NPs (Example 5) or
bare NPs (Examples 3, 8 and 9). The only frequent
syntactic property shared is that bridging NPs tend
to have a simple internal structure with regards to
modification. Bridging is also easily confused with
generics: friends is used as bridging anaphor in Ex-
ample 9 but generically in Example 10.

(3) . . . meat . . . The Communists froze prices instead.

(4) . . . the fund’s building . . . The budget was only
$400,000.

(5) . . . employees . . . A food caterer stashed stones in the

(6) . . . his truck . . . The farmer at the next truck shouts,
”Wheat!”

(7) . . . the firms . . . Crime was the reason that 26% re-
ported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19% said
they were considering moving.

chief executive until his death in an accident five years
ago.

(9) . . . Josephine Baker . . . Friends pitched in.

(10) Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith
together.

Bridging anaphora can have almost limitless varia-
tion. However, we observe that bridging anaphors
are often licensed because of discourse structure

and/or lexical or world knowledge. With regard to
discourse structure, Grosz et al. (1995) observe that
bridging is often needed to establish entity coher-
ence between two adjacent sentences (Examples 1,
2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9). With regard to lexical and world
knowledge, relational noun phrases (Examples 3, 4,
8 and 9), building parts (Example 1), set member-
ship elements (Example 7), or, more rarely, tem-
poral/spatial modification (Example 6) may favor a
bridging reading. Motivated by these observations,
we develop discourse structure and lexico-semantic
features indicating bridging anaphora as well as fea-
tures designed to separate genericity from bridging.

3.2 Features

In Markert et al. (2012) we classify eight fine-
grained IS categories for NPs in written text: old,
new and 6 mediated categories (syntactic, world-
Knowledge, bridging, comparative, aggregate and
function). This feature set (Table 1, f1-f13) works
well to identify old, new and several mediated cate-
gories. However, it fails to recognize most bridging
anaphora which we try to remedy in this work by
including more diverse features.

Discourse structure features (Table 2, f1-f3).
Bridging occurs frequently in sentences where oth-
erwise there would no entity coherence to previous
sentences/clauses (see Grosz et al. (1995) and Poe-
sio et al. (2004b) for discussions about bridging, en-
tity coherence and centering transitions in the Cen-
tering framework). This is especially true for topic
NPs (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) in such sentences.

We follow these insights by identifying coherence
gap sentences (see Examples 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and also
2): a sentence has a coherence gap (f1) if it has none

of the following three coherence elements: (1) entity
coreference to previous sentences, as approximated
via string match or presence of pronouns, (2) com-
parative anaphora approximated by mentions modi-
fied via a small set of comparative markers (see also
Table 1, f10 PreModByCompMarker), or (3) proper
names. We approximate the topic of a sentence via
the first mention (f2).

f3 models that bridging anaphors do not appear
at the beginning of a text.

Semantic features (Table 2, f4-f10). In contrast
to generic patterns, our semantic features capture
lexical properties of nouns that make them more
likely to be the head of a bridging NP. We create
f4-f8 to capture four kinds of bridging anaphora.

Löbner (1985) distinguishes between relational
nouns that take on at least one obligatory semantic
role (such as friend) and sortal nouns. It is likely that
relational nouns are more frequently used as bridg-
ing than sortal nouns (see Examples 3, 4, 8 and 9).
We extract a list containing around 4,000 relational
nouns from WordNet and a list containing around
500 nouns that specify professional roles from the
General Inquirer lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), then
determine whether the NP head appears in these lists

816



or not (f4 and f5). The obligatory semantic role for
a relational noun can of course also be filled NP in-
ternally instead of anaphorically and we use the fea-
tures f10 (for instances such as the Egyptian presi-
dent) and f18 (for complex NPs that are likely to fill
needed roles NP internally) to address this.

Because part-of relations are typical bridging re-
lations (see Example 1 and Clark (1975)), we use f6
to determine whether the NP is a part of the building
or not, using again a list extracted from Inquirer.

f7 is used to identify set membership bridging
cases (see Example 7), by checking whether the
NP head is a number or indefinite pronoun (such as
none, one, some) or modified by each, one. How-
ever, not all numbers are bridging cases (such as
1976) and we use f9 to exclude such cases.

Lassalle and Denis (2011) note that some bridging
anaphors are indicated by spatial or temporal modi-
fications (see Example 6). We use f8 to detect this
by compiling 20 such adjectives from Inquirer.

Features to detect generic nouns (Table 2, f11-
f15). Generic NPs (Example 10) are easily con-
fused with bridging anaphora. Inspired by Reiter
and Frank (2010) who build on linguistic research,
we develop features (f11-f15) to exclude generics.

First, hypothetical entities are likely to refer to
generic entities (Mitchell et al., 2002), We approx-
imate this by determining whether the NP appears
in an if-clause (f11). Also the clause tense and
mood may play a role to decide genericity (Reiter
and Frank, 2010). This is often reflected by the main
verb of a clause, so we extract its POS tag (f12).

Some NPs are commonly used generically, such
as children, men, or the dollar. The ACE-2 corpus
(distinct from our corpus) contains generic annota-
tion . We collect all NPs from ACE-2 that are always
used generically (f13). We also try to learn NPs that
are uniquely identifiable without further description
or anaphoric links such as the sun or the pope. We
do this by extracting common nouns which are an-
notated as worldKnowledge from the training part of
our corpus5 and use these as lexical features (f14).

Finally, motivated by the ACE-2 annotation
guidelines, we identify six quantifiers that may in-
dicate genericity, such as all, no, neither (f15).

5This list varies for each run of our algorithm in 10-fold
cross validation.

Other features for bridging (Table 2, f16-f18).
Following Rahman and Ng (2012), we use unigrams
(f16). We also extract heads of bridging anaphors
from the training data as lexical features (f17) to
learn typical nouns used for bridging that we did not
cover in lexicon extraction (f4 to f6).

Feature f18 models that bridging anaphora most
often have a simple internal structure and usually do
not contain any other NPs.

Features for other IS categories (Table 2, f19-
f21). We propose three features to improve other
IS categories. In the relational feature f19, we sep-
arate coordination parent-child from other parent-
child relations to help with the class aggregate. f20
determines whether a number is the object of an in-
crease/decrease verb (using a list extracted from In-
quirer) and therefore likely to be the IS class func-
tion. Frequent proper names are more likely to be
hearer old and hence of the class worldKnowledge.
f21 extracts proper names that occur in at least 100
documents in the Tipster corpus to approximate this.

4 Experiments and Results

Experimental setup. We perform experiments on
the corpus provided in Markert et al. (2012)6. It con-
sists of 50 texts taken from the WSJ portion of the
OntoNotes corpus (Weischedel et al., 2011) with al-
most 11,000 NPs annotated for information status
including 663 bridging NPs and their antecedents.
All experiments are performed via 10-fold cross-
validation on documents. We use gold standard
mentions and the OntoNotes named entity and syn-
tactic annotation layers for feature extraction.

Reimplemented baseline system (rbls). rbls uses
the same features as Markert et al. (2012) (Table 1)
but replaces the local decision tree classifier with
LibSVM as we will need to include lexical features.

rbls + Table 2 feature set (rbls+newfeat). Based
on rbls, all the new features from Table 2 are added.

et al. (2013), we develop a cascading minority pref-
erence system for fine-grained IS classification. For
the five minority classes (function, aggregate, com-
parative, bridging and worldKnowledge) that each
make up less than the expected 18 of the data set, we
develop five binary classifiers with LibSVM7 using
all features from Tables 1 and 2 and apply them in
order from rarest to more frequent category. When-
ever a minority classifier predicts true, this class is
assigned. When all minority classifiers say false, we
back off to the multiclass rbls+newfeat system.

cmps − Table 2 feature set (cmps−newfeat). To
test the effect of using the minority preference sys-
tem without additional features, we employ a cmps
system with baseline features from Table 1 only.

Results and Discussion (Table 3). Our novel
features in rbls+newfeat show improvements for
worldKnowledge, aggregate and function as well as
bridging categories compared to both baseline sys-
tems, although the performance for bridging is still
low. In addition, the overall accuracy is significantly
better than the two baseline systems (at the level of
1% using McNemar’s test). Using the cascaded mi-
nority preference system cmps in addition improves
bridging results substantially while the performance
on other categories does not worsen. The algorithm
needs both our novel feature classes as well as cas-
caded modelling to achieve this improvement as the
comparison to cmps−newfeat shows: the latter low-
ers overall accuracy as it tends to overgenerate rare

classes (including bridging) with low precision if the
features are not strong enough. Our novel features
(addressing linguistic properties of bridging) and the
cascaded algorithm (addressing data sparseness) ap-
pear to be complementary.

To look at the impact of features in our best sys-
tem, we performed an ablation study. Lexical fea-
tures as well as semantic ones have the most impact.
Discourse structure and genericity information fea-
tures have less of an impact. We believe the latter to
be due to noise involved in extracting these features
(such as approximating coreference for the coher-
ence gap feature) as well as genericity recognition
still being in its infancy (Reiter and Frank, 2010).

5 Conclusions

This paper aims to recognize bridging anaphora in
written text. We develop discourse structure, lexico-
semantic and genericity features based on linguis-
tic intuition and corpus research. By using a cas-
cading minority preference system, we show that
our approach outperforms the bridging recognition
in Markert et al. (2012) by a large margin without
impairing the performance on other IS classes.
