Abstract

Compounding, the process of combining several simplex words into a complex whole, is a pro-
ductive process in a wide range of languages. In particular, concatenative compounding, in
which the components are “glued” together, leads to problems, for instance, in computational
tools that rely on a predefined lexicon. Here we present the AuCoPro project, which focuses
on compounding in the closely related languages Afrikaans and Dutch. The project consists of
subprojects focusing on compound splitting (identifying the boundaries of the components) and
compound semantics (identifying semantic relations between the components). We describe the
developed datasets as well as results showing the effectiveness of the developed datasets.

1 Introduction

In many human language technology applications (e.g. machine translators and spelling checkers), many
concatenatively written compounds are processed incorrectly. One of the reasons for this is that these
applications rely on a predefined lexicon and the productive nature of the process of compound formation
automatically results in incomplete lexicons. For example, consider the novel Afrikaans (Afr.) compound
ministerskatkis ‘treasury of a minister’ that should be segmented as minister+skatkis minister+treasury.
Should it be incorrectly segmented as minister s+kat+kis minister LINK+cat+coffin1 (where LINK
refers to a linking morpheme), one would get the (possible but improbable) interpretation ‘coffin of a
minister’s cat’. From a technological perspective, deficiencies related to automatic compound splitting
(also known as compound segmentation) are particularly problematic, since many other technologies
(such as morphological analyzers, or semantic parsers) might rely on highly accurate compound splitting.

For more advanced natural language processing applications like information extraction, question an-
swering and machine translation systems, proper semantic analysis of compounds might also be required.
With semantic analysis of compounds we refer to the task of determining that the Dutch (Du.) compound
keuken+tafel kitchen+table construes ‘table in kitchen’, while Du. baby+tafel baby+table means ‘table
for a baby’ (and not, fatally so, *‘table in a baby’). Internationally, research on automatic compound
analysis has focused almost exclusively on English; very little work in this regard has been done for
other languages (see section 4.1).

Concatenative compounding is a highly productive process in many languages of the world, such as
West-Germanic languages (Afrikaans, Dutch, Frisian, German, and to a far lesser extent English), Nordic

languages (Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish) and Modern Greek; our focus in this research
is only on Afrikaans and Dutch. Next to derivation, the process of right-headed, recursive compounding
is the most productive word-formation process in these two languages. While almost all parts-of-speech
categories can be found as components of compounds, noun+noun compounds are by far the most fre-
quent type, while noun+verb compounding is generally considered to be non-productive in Germanic
languages (Don, 2009, p. 378). Components of a compound sometimes need to be “glued” together
using linking morphemes. The occurrence of linking morphemes in Afrikaans and Dutch compounds is
well-known (Neijt et al., 2010), like Afr. besigheid s+besluit business LINK+decision ‘business deci-
sion’.

Besides regular compounding, one also finds, amongst others, phrasal compounds (e.g. Afr.
help-my-fris-lyk-hemp help-me-strong-look-shirt ‘gym vest’), (neo)classical compounds (e.g. Afr.
neuro+wetenskap neuro+science ‘neuroscience’, or Du. bio+logie bio+logy ‘biology’), separable ver-
bal compounds (e.g. Du. op+bellen up+call ‘to phone’), reduplicative compounds (e.g. Afr. speel -
+speel play LINK+play ‘easily’), and compounding compounds (i.e. where the two left constituents
are normally a phrase, but joined in a compound through the right-most constituent, e.g. Du. on-
der+water+camera under+water+camera ‘under-water camera’). Except for the latter, none of these
marginal types of compounds were considered as data for any of the systems developed in this research
project.

In section 2 we provide an overview of the automatic compound processing (AuCoPro) project, which
forms the background of this research. Sections 3 and 4 provide details of each of the subprojects relating
to compound splitting and semantic analysis, with details about related research, the development of
datasets, and our experiments. We conclude with a discussion of results and future work in section 5.

2 Overview: The AuCoPro Project

Running from 2012 to 2013, the AuCoPro project was funded by the Dutch Language Union and the
Department of Arts and Culture of the South African Government in a programme to support collab-
orative research in human language technology between Belgium, The Netherlands and South Africa.
Additional funding was provided by the South African National Research Foundation, and the European
Network on Word Structure (NetWordS). The partners involved in the project were the University of
Antwerp (Belgium), Tilburg University (The Netherlands), and North-West University (South Africa).

The primary aim of the project was to develop resources (including annotation protocols, and training
and testing data) for the development of robust compound splitters (subproject 1), and first-generation
compound analyzers (subproject 2) for Afrikaans and Dutch, through a combination of cross-language
transfer (allowing technology recycling), data pooling, and various machine learning approaches. In a
subpart of subproject 2 we also aimed to gain insight in compound semantics by unifying perspectives
from computational semantics (Ó Séaghdha, 2008), typological studies (Scalise and Bisetto, 2009), and
construction-based approaches to word-formation (specifically cognitive grammar (Langacker, 2008)
and construction morphology (Booij, 2010)); the results of which can be found in Van Huyssteen (2014)
and Van Huyssteen and Verhoeven (2014).

Deliverables included eight peer-reviewed publications, a technical report on annotation guidelines
for compound processing, and six datasets. All deliverables are available in the open-source domain at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/aucopro, while more information about the project
is available at http://tinyurl.com/aucopro.

3 Compound Splitting

The aim of subproject 1 was to develop datasets that can be used to build robust compound splitters
for Afrikaans and Dutch, or for a cross-lingual analysis of the use of compounds in the closely related
languages Afrikaans and Dutch. Based on existing datasets containing words that are morphologically
analyzed, we extracted (potential) compounds, removed unwanted morphological information, and re-
analysed and corrected them.

21



In the AuCoPro datasets, compounds are analyzed in a shallow manner: no deep hierarchical ordering
of components is performed. Compounds consisting of more than two elements are annotated by indicat-
ing the location of the boundaries, so for instance, Du. bloem+boll en+veld flower+bulb LINK+field
‘bulb field’ consists of four components, viz. bloem, boll-, -en-, and veld, without any indication of
their syntagmatic relations. The parts bloem, boll- and veld are all simplex words, which we will call
constituents. Constituents are the meaningful parts of a compound. These constituents are prototyp-
ically independent words, but in some cases affixoids (i.e. forms that are somewhere between a word
and an affix in its development) can also occur in compounds (e.g. boer in Du. krant en+boer newspa-
per LINK+farmer ‘newspaper seller’ does not have the literal meaning of farmer; see Booij (2010)).
In some cases a word may undergo morphophonological changes in the context of a compound. For
instance, in the bloembollenveld example, boll- is an allomorph (or allograph) of bol ‘bulb’.

As mentioned above, some compounds require linking morphemes (indicated by LINK in the exam-
ples above) to “glue” components together. Besides ordinary linking morphemes like -e-, -en-, and -s- (in
both languages), we also defined hyphens as linking morphemes. In the orthographies of Afrikaans and
Dutch in general a hyphen is used in cases of vowel collision, i.e. between compound constituents when
the left-hand constituent ends on a vowel, and the right-hand constituent begins with the same vowel, for
example Afr. see -+eend sea LINK+duck ‘seaduck’.

We also mentioned above that marginal compound types such as phrasal compounds, reduplicative
compounds, separable verbal compounds, etc. were not considered as part of the datasets. Similarly, we
excluded synthetic compounds from the datasets when the right-hand element of a synthetic compound
is a non-word (e.g. in Du. blauw+ogig blue+eye-ADJR2 ‘blue-eyed’, *ogig is not a valid independent
word in Dutch). However, for this subproject we accepted and annotated compounding compounds,
since they can generally be split quite easily (e.g. Afr. drie+vlak+regering three+level+government
‘three-level government’).

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed datasets, we started building and evaluating com-
pound splitters for both Dutch and Afrikaans based on the data only. A compound splitter takes a word
as input, and provides as output the input string divided into valid compound components. Note that
these results are only to illustrate that these datasets can be used successfully as training data for such
systems. The actual results can potentially be improved, as the systems are not optimized.

3.1 Related Research

In general, the problem of splitting compounds is found in a wide range of languages. Some of these
languages show non-concatenative compound formation (i.e. compounds are written with whitespaces
between constituents), such as English. Compounds in these languages fall under the umbrella term
multiword expressions (MWEs), which also includes idioms and collocations. Ramisch et al. (2013)
show that this is a quite active research field.

Focusing on concatenative compounding (i.e. where constituents are written conjunctively so that a
compound is always written as a single string without any whitespaces), previous work on Afrikaans has
been performed in the context of the development of spelling checkers (Van Zaanen and Van Huyssteen,
2002; Van Huyssteen and Van Zaanen, 2004). Van Huyssteen and Van Zaanen (2004) describe a com-
pound splitter for Afrikaans. To our knowledge, no stand-alone compound splitter for Dutch is available.
Research done in this field is over ten years old (e.g. Pohlmann and Kraaij (1996)), uses expensive re-
sources (e.g. Ordelman et al. (2003)), does complete morphological analysis (e.g. De Pauw et al. (2004)),
and/or has not been released for re-use in the open-source domain.

3.2 Dataset Development

The datasets developed during this subproject are based on compounds taken from existing (morpho-
logically annotated) datasets. For Dutch, a few morphologically annotated datasets exist, although none
focus on compounds specifically. The development of the Dutch dataset is based on the e-Lex dataset.3

2Adjectiviser.
3This dataset was extended with a compound dataset extracted from CELEX by Lieve Macken (LT3, UGent).

22



The e-Lex dataset contains words annotated with more morphological information than required for
our dataset, but it also contains morphologically annotated non-compound words. After removing non-
compound words (and removing duplicates), 71,274 potential Dutch compounds remained.

For Afrikaans, the situation is more difficult. No dataset containing compound boundary and linking
morpheme boundary information is freely available. The Afrikaans AuCoPro dataset is based on the
PUK-Protea corpus as well as the CTexT Afrikaans spelling checking lexicon (CTexT, 2005; Pilon et al.,
2008). Both corpora do not describe any morphological information. To identify potential compounds,
a longest string matching algorithm (Van Huyssteen and Van Zaanen, 2004) is applied. This algorithm
identifies compounds by searching for known (simplex) words from the left and right ends of the potential
compound, taking the possibility of the occurrence of linking morphemes into account. This algorithm
seems to identify most compounds as well as some non-compounds, which resulted in a list of 77,651
potential Afrikaans compounds.

After this automatic collection and cleanup (for Dutch) and automatic identification and annotation (for
Afrikaans), annotators checked each compound for correct linking morpheme and compound boundaries.
For Afrikaans, seven annotators together checked 25,266 compounds. For Dutch, two annotators checked
26,000 potential compounds. In the end, this resulted in 18,497 and 21,997 true compounds for Afrikaans
and Dutch respectively.

To be able to calculate inter-annotator agreement, subsets of approximately 1,000 words were an-
notated by pairs of annotators. For Dutch in total 6,000 words were used to calculate inter-annotator
agreement and for Afrikaans 12,818 words. This leads to an average Cohen’s Kappa of 98.6 and 97.6 for
Afrikaans and Dutch respectively.

The annotators had access to an annotation manual (Verhoeven et al., 2014), which was developed
specifically for this project. The manual is based on the annotation guidelines that were developed
during the CKarma project (CTexT, 2005; Pilon et al., 2008). These initial guidelines only apply to
Afrikaans, and was hence extended to handle Dutch compounds as well as more complicated cases
not foreseen in the original CKarma guidelines. During the annotation process, regular discussions
between the annotators took place, which resulted in changes in the data and (minor) modifications to
the annotation guidelines.

3.3 Experiments

One of the reasons for creating the compound splitting datasets is to show their usefulness in the de-
velopment of automatic compound splitting systems. These systems search for compound boundaries,
effectively identifying the simplex words in compounds. This information is essential, for instance, when
developing spelling correction systems or machine translation systems for languages that have productive
compound formation processes.

As a classifier, we used the algorithm developed by Liang (1983). This system, which is used as
the hyphenation method in the LATEX typesetting system, identifies letter combinations that either allow
or disallow boundary breaks. Even though the task of compound boundary detection is different from
hyphenation (or syllabification), the tasks are similar enough to use the same method. Since the system
is trainable, instead of hyphenation breaks, compound boundaries are provided.

Since no separate annotated gold standard test set is available, we performed leave-one-out evaluation
(using all but one instance for training and the remaining instance for testing; all instances are evaluated
once) using the full dataset. This approach is preferred over, for instance, 10-fold cross validation, which
each time removes 10% of the training data for testing. Additionally, it does not depend on a “lucky”
selection of test data from the training data, as all compounds are tested.

Evaluating the datasets using this system (which does not have any additional tuning parameters)
results in classification accuracies of 88.28% and 91.48% on the word level for Afrikaans and Dutch
respectively. We assume that further improvements are possible with alternative systems and parameter
optimization.

4 Compound Semantics

The automatic processing of the semantics of compounds (or other complex nominals) is a topic in
computational linguistics that, although it has been studied regularly in the past, cannot be considered
a solved problem. Although previous research was often promising, it also had an almost exclusive
focus on English noun-noun (NN) compounds. In recent years, more languages have been studied (e.g.
German (Hinrichs et al., 2013) and Italian (Celli and Nissim, 2009)), and this project added Dutch and
Afrikaans to the list.

It is worth noting that a number of different operationalizations of compound interpretation have been
studied. The most notable are semantic classification of the constituent relation according to a limited
set of semantic categories (e.g. Ó Séaghdha (2008)), and the generation of possible paraphrases for
the compound that express its meaning more explicitly (Hendrickx et al., 2013). Our study adopts the
classification model, in which the set of semantic relations to be predicted (the classification scheme) is
crucial.

4.1 Related Research

Several attempts have been made in the past to postulate appropriate classification schemes for noun-
noun compound semantics. These schemes are mainly inventory-based in that they present a limited list
of predefined possible classes of semantic relations a compound can manifest.

In some cases, proposed classes are abstractly represented by a paraphrasing preposition (Lauer, 1995;
Girju et al., 2005; Lapata and Keller, 2004). For example, all compounds that can be paraphrased by
putting the preposition “of” between the constituents belong to the class OF, e.g. a car door is the
‘door of a car’. Another possibility is using predicate-based classes where the relations between the
constituents are not merely described by a preposition, but by definitions or paraphrasing predicates for
each class. The class AGENT would contain compounds that could be paraphrased as ‘X is performed
by Y’ (Kim and Baldwin, 2005), e.g. enemy activity can be paraphrased as ‘activity is performed by
the enemy’. Different schemes vary from 9 to 43 classes with Cohen’s Kappa scores for inter-annotator
agreement ranging from 52% to 62% (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Girju et al., 2005; Moldovan et al.,
2004; Nakov, 2008; Ó Séaghdha, 2008).

With regard to the information used by the classifier to assign the classes to the compounds (the fea-
tures of a compound to be analyzed), two main approaches are available, viz. taxonomy-based methods,
or corpus-based methods.

Taxonomy-based methods (also called semantic network similarity (Ó Séaghdha, 2009)) base their fea-
tures on a word’s location in a taxonomy or hierarchy of terms. Most of the taxonomy-based techniques
use WordNet (Miller, 1995) for these purposes; especially the hyponym information in the hierarchy
is used. A bag of words is created of all hyponyms and the instance vector contains binary values for
each feature (the feature being whether the considered word from the bag of words is a hyponym of the
constituent or not). Kim and Baldwin (2005) reached an accuracy of 53.3% using only WordNet. Other
research was based on Wikipedia as a semantic network (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).

Corpus-based methods use co-occurrence information of the constituents of the selected compounds
in a corpus. The underlying idea (the distributional hypothesis) is that the set of contexts in which a
word occurs, is an implicit representation of the semantics of this word (Harris, 1968). The lexical sim-
ilarity measure assumes that compounds have a similar semantic interpretation when their respective
constituents are semantically similar. Two compounds, for example flour can and corn bag will be con-
sidered similar if they have similar modifying constituents (flour and corn) and similar head constituents
(can and bag). The co-occurrences of both constituents will be combined to calculate a measure of sim-
ilarity for the entire compound. This approach implicitly uses the lexical semantic knowledge also used
in taxonomy-based methods but without the need for a taxonomy. Performances of up to 64% F-score
have been reached (Ó Séaghdha and Copestake, 2013).

Corpus-based and taxonomy-based methods have also been combined by several researchers. Accu-
racies of 58.35% (Ó Séaghdha, 2007), 73.9% (Tratz and Hovy, 2010) and even 82.47% (Nastase et al.,
2006) were reported.

4.2 Dataset Development
For this project, we developed datasets of semantically annotated compounds for Afrikaans and Dutch.
This section describes these new resources.

The annotation scheme and guidelines that we used as basis, were developed by Ó Séaghdha (2008)
for semantic annotation of English NN compounds. For purposes of our project, some adaptations were
in order, while Dutch and Afrikaans examples were added (Verhoeven et al., 2014). Ó Séaghdha (2008)
describes eleven classes of compounds; six of these classes are semantically specific (see Table 1).

Class Definition Example

BE
The compound can be rewritten as ‘N2 which is (like) (a) N1’ with N1
and N2 being the two constituents nouns.

woman doctor

HAVE
The compound denotes some sort of possession. Part-whole com-
pounds, typical one-to-many possession, compounds expressing condi-
tions or properties and meronymic compounds belong here.

car door

IN The compound denotes a location in time or place. garden party

ACTOR
The compound denotes a characteristic event or situation and one of the
constituents is a salient entity.

enemy activity

INST
The compound denotes a characteristic event and there is no salient en-
tity present.

cheese knife

ABOUT The compound describes a topical relation between its constituents. film character

Table 1: Overview of semantically specific categories in the semantics annotation scheme.

The other five categories are less specific. The MISTAG and NONCOMPOUND categories serve
to classify compounds that do not belong in the dataset. The REL class describes compounds with a
clear meaning that does not belong to any of the other classes, but of which the relation between the
constituents seems productive (e.g. sodium chloride). The LEX category is almost the same as REL,
but the relation does not seem to be productive (e.g. monkey business). The UNKNOWN category is for
correct NN compounds of which the meaning is not clear enough to annotate.

As a subpart of this subproject, we also developed an annotation protocol for nominal compounds that
do not have a noun as first constituent (XN) (Verhoeven and Van Huyssteen, 2013). Such XN compounds
had thus far mostly been neglected, despite the fact that they are fairly productive in some Germanic
languages (although far less frequent than NN compounds). Our annotation guidelines followed the
general approach of Ó Séaghdha (2008).

In the course of the project, several datasets were developed. For both Dutch and Afrikaans there were
two annotation rounds for NN compounds and one smaller annotation experiment for XN compounds.
An overview of the semantics data can be found in Table 2, including the average Cohen’s Kappa scores.

The Dutch NN compounds were taken from the same raw compound list of 71,274 compounds de-
scribed in section 3.2 above. Subsequent annotations were performed by students in linguistics at the
University of Antwerp, all native speakers of Dutch. The first dataset was annotated by one student, and
a subset of 500 compounds by one of the authors in order to calculate inter-annotator agreement. The
second round of data was annotated by three students, with the data divided between them in such a way
that we had two annotations for each compound. For the XN compound dataset, only 600 compounds
were annotated.

The NN compounds for the Afrikaans dataset were taken from the CKarma list of split compounds
(see section 3.2 above). The complete Afrikaans dataset was annotated by three undergraduate linguistics
students, all native speakers of Afrikaans. This resulted in three annotations for each compound. With
regard to the XN compound subpart, a large dataset of 4,553 compounds was annotated.

4.3 Experiments
The data from the first annotation rounds were used for semantic classification experiments that were
based on those conducted by Ó Séaghdha (2008). We used the annotations made by the main annotator

for each language in order to maintain his or her consistency of annotation. What follows is a description
of our own experimental setup. In our classification experiment, classifiers trained by machine learning
methods use feature vectors arising from a combination of the distributional hypothesis (as proposed
above) with the idea of analogical reasoning. It is assumed that the semantic category of a compound
can be predicted by comparing compounds with similar meanings (Ó Séaghdha, 2008).

4.3.1 Vector Creation

For every compound constituent, the co-occurrence context was calculated. For this purpose, for each
instance of the constituents in the corpus, the surrounding n words (that belong to the 10,000 most
frequent words of the corpus) were held in memory. The relative frequencies of these context words (the
number of times the word appeared in the context of the constituent, divided by the frequency of the
constituent in the corpus) for each constituent were stored.

For Dutch, the Twente News Corpus (Ordelman et al., 2007) was used. This is a 340 million word
corpus of newspaper articles. For Afrikaans, we used the Taalkommissie corpus (Taalkommissie, 2011),
a 60 million word corpus that consists of a variety of text genres.

A concatenation of the constituent data was used to create the instance vector. This is a new but very
simple technique of composition whereby each instance vector thus contains the relative frequencies for
the 1,000 most frequent words for each constituent (hence 2,000 per compound). Compounds of which
one or both of the constituents did not appear in the corpus were excluded from the data.

The classification experiment dealt with those compounds that were annotated with a semantically
specific category. This means that only compounds with the category tags BE, HAVE, IN, INST, AC-
TOR and ABOUT were used for the experiments. The final vector set for Afrikaans contained 1,439
compounds, while the final vector set for Dutch had 1,447 compounds.

4.3.2 Results

As machine learning method, we used the SMO algorithm, which is WEKA’s (Witten et al., 2011)
support vector machines (SVM) implementation, in a 10-fold cross-validation setup.

Since this was the first research on both Dutch and Afrikaans (Verhoeven et al., 2012), we assumed
a majority baseline which represents the accuracy that can be obtained by always guessing the most
frequent class as the output class. For Dutch, this baseline is 29.5% (428 instances of class IN on a total
of 1,447 compounds) (Verhoeven, 2012). For Afrikaans, this baseline is 28.2% (407 instances of class
ABOUT on a total of 1,439 instances).

The outcome of these experiments showed that the semantic relation between compound constituents
in Dutch and Afrikaans can be learned using our simple new composition method of concatenating
the constituent vectors into a compound vector. F-scores of 47.8 (Dutch) and 51.1 (Afrikaans) were
achieved using the counts of three context words left and right of the constituent for computing their
semantic representation. The approach turned out to be robust for varying sizes of context (different
numbers of context words), as well as for the way corpus counts were done: on either lemmas or word
forms (Verhoeven, 2012; Verhoeven and Daelemans, 2013). Our results are a good improvement of our
baselines, and provide a baseline for future research.

26



4.3.3 WordNet-based method for Afrikaans
In another subpart of this subproject, we experimented with an alternative approach, namely to use the
Afrikaans WordNet (CTexT, 2011) to infer compound semantics of Afrikaans compounds (Botha et al.,
2013). We followed the same approach as Kim and Baldwin (2005), and achieved precision results
similar to the general approach described above. i.e. 50.49% using the Afrikaans WordNet, vs. 50.80%
reported by Verhoeven et al. (2012). However, recall was much worse: 29.27% in this approach, vs.
51.60% using the other approach. This poor recall can be attributed to the small size of the Afrikaans
WordNet, which only contains 10,045 synsets, compared to 115,424 synsets in the Princeton WordNet
(Miller, 1995). We therefore conclude that a WordNet-approach holds much promise, on the premise
that the WordNet is large enough to ensure good coverage.

5 Discussion

We described machine learning approaches to the segmentation and semantic interpretation of com-
pounds in Dutch and Afrikaans, two related languages where concatenative compounding is a highly
productive morphological process. Success of machine learning approaches to any natural language pro-
cessing task is based on the presence of sufficient high quality training data and relevant information
sources allowing the classification problem to be solved.

For compound splitting, high annotator agreement in the annotation of the training data and high
generalization accuracy could be obtained for both languages using a statistical pattern induction method
working on the orthography of the input compounds, without need for other information sources. Further
improvement can be achieved here with more and richer training data. Other methods for sequence
learning could lead to further improvements as well, although Liang’s method (1983) turns out to be a
strong algorithm for this task.

The task of compound interpretation is much more difficult, both for people (who reached relatively
low annotation agreement for both languages) and for machine learners, suggesting that crucial infor-
mation is missing in the semantic representations we used for our compound constituents. Nevertheless,
also for this task, we were able to set a standard, well above baseline, for future work in compound in-
terpretation for Dutch and Afrikaans. Further improvement can potentially be found in many directions:
more fine-grained and more learnable semantic relation types, more consistently annotated training data
(and much more of it from different domains), and better semantic representations for the constituents,
for example using deep learning (Mikolov et al., 2013).
