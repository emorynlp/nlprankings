Abstract 

The focus of this talk is on the applications and techniques currently used in government screening 
venues and on anticipated future applications. I will begin with a discussion of how and why the 
polygraph is used in a screening interview and touch on some of the newer techniques in deception 
detection using body movements, vocal and verbal behavior that are now being tested. We'll then look 
at some of the needs for deception detection and applications on our wish list. The talk will include 
cases where the current technology has been good and where it has not.
