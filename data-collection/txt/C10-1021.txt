Abstract 

This  paper  proposes  a  multi-label  ap-
proach  to  detect  emotion  causes.  The 
multi-label  model  not only  detects  mul-
ti-clause  causes,  but  also  captures  the 
long-distance  information  to  facilitate 
emotion  cause  detection.  In  addition, 
based on the linguistic analysis, we cre-
ate two sets of linguistic patterns during 
feature extraction. Both manually gener-
alized patterns and automatically gener-
alized  patterns  are  designed  to  extract 
general  cause  expressions  or  specific 
constructions  for  emotion  causes.  Ex-
periments 
system 
achieves  a  performance  much  higher 
than a baseline model.

Introduction 

Text-based emotion  processing  has  been a  cen-
ter of attention in the NLP field in the past few 
years.  Most  previous  researches  have  focused 
on  detecting  the  surface  information  of  emo-
tions,  especially  emotion  classes,  e.g.,  “happi-
ness”  and  “anger”  (Mihalcea  and  Liu  2006, 
Strapparava  and  Mihalcea  2008,  Abbasi  et  al, 
2008,  Tokuhisa  et  al.  2008).  Although  most 
emotion theories recognize the important role of 
causes  in  emotion  analysis  (Descartes,  1649; 
James, 1884; Plutchik 1980, Wierzbicka 1999), 
very  few  studies  explore  the  interactions  be-
tween  emotion  and  causes.  Emotion-cause  in-
teraction  is  the  eventive  relation  which  poten-
tially  yields  the  most  crucial  information  in 
terms  of  information  extraction.  For  instance, 
knowing  the  existence  of  an  emotion  is  often 
insufficient to predict future events or decide on 
the best reaction. However, if the emotion cause 
is  known  in  addition  to  the  type  of  emotion, 

 

prediction of future events or assessment of po-
tential  implications  can  be  done  more  reliably. 
In  other  words,  when  emotion  is  treated  as  an 
event,  causal  relation  is  the  pivotal  relation  to 
discover.  In  this  paper,  we  explore  one  of  the 
crucial deep level types of information of emo-
tion, i.e. cause events.  

Our  study  focuses  on  explicit  emotions  in 
which emotions are often presented by emotion 
keywords  such  as  “shocked”  in  “He  was 
shocked after hearing the news”. Emotion caus-
es are the explicitly expressed propositions that 
evoke  the  presence  of  the  corresponding  emo-
tions.  They  can  be  expressed  by  verbs,  nomi-
nalizations,  and  nominals.  Lee  et  al.  (2010a) 
explore the causes of explicit emotions by con-
structing  a  Chinese  emotion  cause  corpus. 
Based on this corpus, we formalize the emotion 
cause detection problem through extensive data 
analysis. We find that ~14% emotion causes are 
complicated  events  containing  multi-clauses,  to 
which  previous  cause  detection  systems  can 
hardly be applied directly. Most previous cause 
detection  systems  focus  on  the  causal  relation 
between  a  pair  of  small-size  text  units,  such  as 
clauses  or  phrases.  They  are  thus  not  able  to 
detect emotion causes that are multi-clauses. In 
this  paper,  we  formalize  emotion  cause  detec-
tion as a multi-label classification task (i.e. each 
instance  may  contain  more  than  one  label), 
which  allows  us to  capture  long-distance  infor-
mation for emotion cause detection. 

In  term  of  feature  extraction,  as  emotion 
cause  detection  is  a  case  of  cause  detection, 
some typical patterns used in existing cause de-
tection systems, e.g., “because” and “thus”, can 
be  adopted.  In  addition,  various  linguistic  cues 
are  examined  which  potentially  indicate  emo-
tion  causes,  such  as  causative  verbs  and  epis-
temic  markers  (Lee  at  al.  2010a).  Then  some 
linguistic  patterns  of  emotion  causes  are  manu-

180

ally  generalized  by  examining  the  linguistic 
context of the empirical data (Lee et al., 2010b). 
It  is  expected  that  these  manually  generalized 
patterns  often  yield  a  low-coverage  problem. 
Thus,  we  extracted  features  which  enable  us  to 
automatically  capture  more  emotion-specific 
constructions.  Experiments  show  that  such  an 
integrated  system  with  various  linguistic  fea-
tures  performs  promisingly  well.  We  believe 
that  the  present  study  should  provide  the  foun-
dation  for  future  research  on  emotion  analysis, 
such  as  the  detection  of  implicit  emotion  or 
cause.  

The paper  is  organized  as follows.  Section 2 
discusses  the  related  work  on  cause-effect  de-
tection.  Section  3  briefly  describes  the  emotion 
cause corpus, and then presents our data analy-
sis. Section 4 introduces the multi-label classifi-
cation system for emotion cause detection. Sec-
tion 5 describes the two kinds of features for our 
system, one is based on hand-coded patterns and 
the  other  is  the  generalized  features.  Section  6 
presents  the  evaluation  and  performance  of  our 
system. Section 7 highlights our main contribu-
tions and the possible future work. 

2  Related Work 

Most  previous  studies  on  textual  emotion  proc-
essing focus on emotion recognition or classifi-
cation  given  a  known  emotion  context  (Mihal-
cea  and  Liu  2006,  Strapparava  and  Mihalcea 
2008, Abbasi et al, 2008, Tokuhisa et al. 2008). 
However,  the  performance  is  far  from  satisfac-
tory. One crucial problem in these works is that 
they limit the emotion analysis to a simple clas-
sification and do not explore the underlying in-
formation  regarding  emotions.  Most  theories 
conclude that emotions are often invoked by the 
perception of external events. An effective emo-
tion recognition model should thus take this into 
account.  

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  little  research 
has  been  done  with  respect  to  emotion  cause 
detection. Lee et al. (2010a) first investigate the 
interactions  between  emotions  and  the  corre-
sponding  causes  from  a  linguistic  perspective. 
They annotate a small-scale emotion cause cor-
pus,  and  identify  six  groups  of  linguistic  cues 
facilitating  emotion  cause  detection.  Based  on 
these findings, they develop a rule-based system 

for  automatic  emotion  cause  detection  (Lee  et 
al., 2010b).  

Emotion cause detection can be considered as 
a  kind  of  causal  relation  detection,  which  has 
been  intensively  studied  for  years.  Most  previ-
ous  cause  detection  studies  focus  on  a  specific 
domain, such as aviation (Persing and Ng, 2009) 
and  finance  (Low,  et  al.,  2001).  Few  works 
(Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Girju, 2003; Chang 
and  Choi,  2005)  examine  causal  relation  for 
open domains. 

In recognizing causal relations, most existing 
systems  involve  two  steps:  1)  cause  candidate 
identification;  2)  causal  relation  detection.  To 
simplify the task, most systems omit the step of 
identifying cause candidates. Instead, they often 
predefine  or filter  out  possible  causes  based  on 
domain knowledge, e.g., 14 kinds of cause types 
are identified for aviation incidents (Persing and 
Ng,  2009).  For  events  without  specific  domain 
information,  open-domain  systems  choose  to 
limit  their  cause  candidate.  For  example,  the 
cause-effect  pairs  are  limited  to  two  noun 
phrases (Chang and Choi, 2005; Girju, 2003), or 
two  clauses  connected  with  fixed  conjunction 
words (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). 

Given pairs of cause-effect candidates, causal 
relation detection is considered as a binary clas-
sification  problem, 
i.e.  “causal”  vs.  “non-
causal”.  In  general,  there  are  two  kinds  of  in-
formation  extracted  to  identify  the  causal  rela-
tion. One is patterns or constructions expressing 
a  cause-effect  relation  (Chang  and  Choi,  2005; 
Girju, 2003), and the other is semantic informa-
tion  underlying  in  a  text  (Marcu  and  Echihabi, 
2002; Persing and Ng, 2009), such as word pair 
probability.  Undoubtedly,  the  two  kinds  of  in-
formation  usually  interact  with  each  other  in  a 
real cause detection system. 

In the literature, the three common classifica-

tion methods, i.e. unsupervised, semi-supervised, 
and  supervised,  have  all  been  used  for  cause 
detection  systems.  Marcu  and  Echihabi  (2002) 
first collected a cause corpus using an unsuper-
vised approach with the help of several conjunc-
tion  words,  such  as  “because”  and  “thus”,  and 
determined  the  causal  relation  for  a  clause  pair 
using the word pair probability. Chang and Choi 
(2005) used a semi-supervised method to recur-
sively  learn  lexical  patterns  for  cause  recogni-
tion based on syntactic trees. Bethard and Mar-
tin  (2008)  put  various  causal  information  in  a 

181

supervised  classifier,  such  as  the  temporal  in-
formation and syntactic information.  

For  our  emotion  cause  detection,  several 
practical  issues  need  to  be  investigated  and  re-
solved. First, for the identification of cause can-
didates, we need to define a reasonable span of 
a cause. Based on our data analysis, we find that 
emotion  causes  often  appear  across  phrases  or 
even  clauses.  Second,  although  in  emotion 
cause  detection  the  effect  is  fixed,  the  cause  is 
open-domain.  We  also  notice  that  besides  the 
common  patterns,  emotion  causes  have  their 
own  expression  patterns.  An  effective  emotion 
cause  detection  system  should  take  them  into 
account. 

ated  with  more  than  one  cause,  in  such  a 
case,  both  causes  are  marked.  Moreover, 
the  cause  type  is  also  identified,  which  is 
either a nominal event or a verbal event (a 
verb or a nominalization).  

Lee  at  al.  (2010a)  notice  that  72%  of  the  ex-
tracted entries express emotions, and 80% of the 
emotional entries have a cause. 

3.2  The Analysis of Emotion Causes 

To  have  a  deeper  understanding  of  emotion 
cause  detection,  we  take  a  closer  look  at  the 
emotion cause distribution, including the distri-
bution of emotion cause occurrence and the dis-
tribution of emotion cause text. 

3  Corpus Analysis  

In this section, we briefly introduce the Chinese 
emotion  cause  corpus  (Lee  et  al.,  2010a),  and 
discuss emotion cause distribution. 

3.1  Emotion Cause corpus 

Lee  at al.  (2010a)  made the  first  attempt to ex-
plore  the  correlation  between  emotions  and 
causes,  and  annotate  a  Chinese  emotion  cause 
corpus.  The  emotion  cause  corpus  focuses  on 
five  primary  emotions,  namely  “happiness”, 
“sadness”,  “fear”,  “anger”,  and  “surprise”.  The 
emotions  are  explicitly  expressed  by  emotion 
keywords, e.g., gao1xing4 “happy”, shang1xin1 
“sad”, etc. The corpus is created as follows. 
1.  6,058  entries  of  Chinese  sentences  are  ex-
tracted from the Academia Sinica Balanced 
Corpus  of  Mandarin  Chinese  (Sinica  Cor-
pus) with the pattern-match method as well 
as  the  list  of  91  Chinese  primary  emotion 
keywords  (Chen  et  al.,  2009).  Each  entry 
contains  the  focus  sentence  with  the  emo-
tion  keyword  “<FocusSentence>”  plus  the 
sentence  before  “<PrefixSentence>”  and 
after “<SuffixSentence>” it. For each entry, 
the  emotion  keywords  are  indexed  since 
more than one emotion may be presented in 
an entry;  

2.  Some preprocessing, such as balancing the 
number  of  entry  among  emotions,  is  done 
to  remove  some  entries.  Finally,  5,629  en-
tries remain; 

3.  Each  emotion  keyword  is  annotated  with 
its  corresponding  causes  if  existing.  An 
emotion keyword can sometimes be associ-

 

The occurrence of emotion causes: According 
to  most  emotion  theories,  an  emotion  is  gener-
ally  invoked  by  an  external  event.  The  corpus 
shows that, however, 20% of the emotional en-
tries  have  no  cause.  Entries  without  causes  ex-
plicitly expressed are mainly due to the follow-
ing reasons: 

i) There is not enough contextual information, 
for  instance  the  previous  or  the  suffix  sentence 
is interjections, e.g., en heng “aha”;  

ii)  When  the focus  sentence  is the  beginning 
or the ending of a paragraph, no prefix sentence 
or  suffix  sentence  can  be  extracted  as  the  con-
text.  In  this  case,  the  cause  may  be  beyond  the 
context;  

iii)  The  cause  is  obscure,  which  can  be  very 

abstract or even unknown reasons.  
 
The emotion cause text: A cause is considered 
as  a  proposition.  It  is  generally  assumed  that  a 
proposition has a verb which optionally takes a 
noun  occurring  before  it  as  the  subject  and  a 
noun after it as the object. However, a cause can 
also be expressed as a nominal. In other words, 
both  the  predicate  and  the  two  arguments  are 
optional  provided  that  at  least  one  of  them  is 
present. Thus,  the fundamental  issue  in  design-
ing a cause detection system is the definition of 
the  span  of  a  cause  text.  As  mentioned,  most 
previous  studies  on  causal  relations  choose  to 
ignore the identification of cause candidates. In 
this  paper,  we  first  analyze  the  distribution  of 
cause  text  and  then  determine  the  cause  candi-
dates for an emotion. 

Based  on  the  emotion  cause  corpus,  we  find 
that  emotion  causes  are  more  likely  to  be  ex-

182

pressed  by  verbal  events  than  nominal  events 
(85%  vs.  15%).  Although  a  nominalization  (a 
kind of verbal events) is usually a noun phrase, 
a  proposition  containing  a  verb  plays  a  salient 
role  in  the  expressions  of  emotion  causes,  and 
thus  a  cause  candidate  are  more  likely  to  be  a 
clause-based unit. 

In  addition,  the  actual  cause  can  sometimes 
be  too  long  and  complicated,  which  involves 
several events. In order to explore the span of a 
cause text, we do the following analysis. 
 

Cause (%)

cause is either a verbal event or a nominal event; 
otherwise, it will be removed from the list. 

Secondly,  we  calculate  whether  a  cause  can-
didate overlaps with the real cause, as shown in 
Table  1. We  find that  emotion  causes  are  more 
likely  to  occur  in  the  left  of  emotion  keyword. 
This observation is consistent with the fact that 
an emotion is often trigged by an external hap-
pened  event.  Thirdly,  for  all  causes  occurring 
between  ‘left_2’  and  ‘right_1’,  we  calculate 
whether a cause occurs across clauses, as in Ta-
ble  2.  We  observe  that  most  causes  locate 
within  the  same  clause  of  the  representation  of 
the  emotion  (85.57%).  This  suggests  that  a 
clause  may  be  the  most  appropriate  unit  to  de-
tect a cause.

Firstly, for each emotion keyword, an entry is 
segmented  into  clauses  with  four  punctuations 
(i.e.  commas,  periods,  question  marks  and  ex-
clamation  marks),  and thus  an  entry  becomes  a 
list  of  cause  candidates.  For  example,  when  an 
entry  has  four  clauses,  its  corresponding  list  of 
cause  candidates  contains  five  text  units,  i.e. 
<left_2,  left_1,  left_0,  right_0,  right_1>.  If  we 
assume  the  clause  where  emotion  keyword  lo-
cates is a focus  clause, ‘left_2’  and  ‘left_1’ are 
previous  two  clauses,  and  ‘right_1’  is  the  fol-
lowing one. ‘left_0’ and ‘right_0’ are the partial 
texts of the focus clause, which locate in the left 
side  of  and  the  right  side  of  the  emotion  key-
word, respectively. Moreover, a cause candidate 
must  contain  either  a  noun  or  a  verb  because  a 

A cause detection system is to identify the caus-
al relation between a pair of two text units. For 
emotion  cause  detection,  one  of  the  two  text 
units  is  fixed  (i.e.  the  emotion  keyword),  and 
therefore  the  remaining  two  unresolved  issues 
are  the  identification  of  the  other  text  unit  and 
the causal relation. 

From  the  above  data  analysis,  there  are  two 
observations.  First,  most  emotion  causes  are 
verbal  events,  which  are  often  expressed  by  a 
proposition  (or  a  clause).  Thus,  we  define  an-
other text unit as a clause, namely a cause can-
didate.  Second,  as  most  emotion  causes  occur 
between  ‘left_2’  and  ‘right_1’  (~80%),  we  de-
fine  the  cause  candidates  for  an  emotion  as 
<left_2, left_1, left_0, right_0, right_1>.  

Differing from the existing cause systems, we 
formalize  emotion  cause  detection  as  a  multi-
label problem. In other words, given an emotion 
keyword  and  its  context,  its  label  is  the  loca-
tions of its causes, such as “left_1, left_0”. This 
multi-label-based  formalization  of  the  cause 
detection task has two advantages. First, it is an 
integrated  system  detecting  causes  for  an  emo-
tion  from  the  contextual  information.  In  most 
previous cause detection systems, a causal rela-
tion  is  identified  based  on  the  information  be-
tween two small text units, i.e. a pair of clauses 
or  noun  phrases,  and  therefore  it  is  often  the 
case  that  long-distance  information  is  missed. 
Second, the multi-label-based tagging is able to 

183

capture the relationship between two cause can-
didates.  For  example,  “left_2”  and  “left_1”  are 
often  combined  as  a  complicated  event  as  a 
cause.   

As  a  multi-label  classification  task,  every 
multi-label classifier is applicable. In this study, 
we use a simple strategy: we treat each possible 
combination  of  labels  appearing  in  the  training 
data  as  a  unique  label.  Note  that  an  emotion 
without  causes  is  labeled  as  “None”.  This  con-
verts  multi-label  classification  to  single-label 
classification,  which  is  suitable  for  any  multi-
class  classification  technologies.  In  particular, 
we choose a Max Entropy tool, Mallet1, to per-
form the classification.  

5  Linguistic Features  

As  explained,  there  are  basically  two  kinds  of 
features  for  cause  detection,  namely  pattern-
based  features  and  semantic-based  features.  In 
this  study,  we  develop  two  sets  of  patterns 
based on linguistic analysis: one is a set of ma-
nually  generalized  patterns,  and  the  other  con-
tains  automatically  generalized  patterns.  All  of 
these  patterns  explore  causal  constructions  ei-
ther  for  general  causal  relations  or  for  specific 
emotion cause relations. 

5.1  Linguistic Cues  

Based  on  the  linguistic  analysis,  Lee  et  al. 
(2010a)  identify  six  groups  of  linguistic  cue 
words  that  are  highly  collocated  with  emotion 
causes, as shown in Table 3. Each group of the 
linguistic  cues  serves  as  an  indicator  marking 
the  causes  in  different  emotional  constructions. 
In this paper, these groups of linguistic cues are 
reinterpreted  from  the  computational  perspec-
tive, and are used to develop pattern-based fea-
tures for the emotion cause detection system.

For emotion cause processing, Group I and II 
contain cues which are for general cause detec-
tion,  and  while  Group  III,  IV  and  V  include 
cues  specifically  for  emotion  cause  detection. 
Group  VI  includes  other  linguistic  cues  that  do 
not fall into any of the five groups.  

Group  I  covers  some  prepositions  which  all 
roughly  mean  ‘for’,  and  Group  II  contains  the 
conjunctions  that  explicitly  mark  the  emotion 
cause. Group I is expected to capture the prepo-
sitions  constructions  in  the  focus  clause  where 
the emotion keyword locates. Group II tends to 
capture the rhetorical relation expressed by con-
junction  words  so  as  to  infer  causal  relation 
among multi-clauses. These two groups are typ-
ical features for general cause detection. 

Group  III  includes three common  light  verbs 
which correspond to the English equivalents “to 
make” or “to cause”. Although these light verbs 
themselves do not convey any concrete meaning, 
they are often associated with several construc-
tions  to  express  emotions  and  at  the  same  time 
indicate the position of emotion causes. For ex-
ample, “The birthday party made her happy”.  

One  apparent  difference  between  emotion 
causes  and  general  causes  is  that  emotions  are 
often  triggered  by  human  activities  or  the  per-
ception of such activities, e.g., “glad to say” or 
“glad to hear”. Those human activities are often 
strong  indicators  for  the  location  of  emotion 

184

causes. Group IV and V are used to capture this 
kind of information. Group IV is a list of verbs 
of  thinking  and  talking,  and  Group  V  includes 
four types of epistemic markers which are usu-
ally  verbs  marking  the  cognitive  awareness  of 
emotions in the complement position. The epis-
temic markers include verbs of seeing, hearing, 
knowing, and existing. 

  

5.2  Linguistic Patterns  

With  the six  groups  of  linguistic  cues,  we  gen-
eralize  14  rules  used  in  Lee  et  al.  (2010b)  to 
locate the clause positions of an emotion cause, 
as shown in Table 4. The abbreviations used in 
the rules are given as follows:

Rule 1: 
i)  C(B/F) + III(F) + K(F)  
ii)  C = the nearest N/V before III in F/B  
 
Rule 1 indicates that the cause (C) comes before 
Group III cue words. Theoretically, in identify-
ing C, we look for the nearest verb/noun occur-
ring  before  Group  III  cue  words  in  the  focus 
clause (F) or the clauses before the focus clause 
(B),  and  consider  the  clause  containing  this 
verb/noun as a cause. Practically, for each cause 
candidate, 
this 
feature  with 
verb/noun,  we 
“left_1_rule_1=1”.

5.3  Generalized Patterns  

Rule-based  patterns  usually  achieve  a  rather 
high accuracy, but suffer from low coverage. To 
avoid this shortcoming, we extract a generalized 
feature  automatically  according  to  the  rules  in 
Table  4.  The  features  are  able  to  detect  two 
kinds  of  constructions,  namely  functional  con-
structions, i.e. rhetorical constructions, and spe-
cific constructions for emotion causes.  
Local functional constructions: a cause occur-
ring in the focus clause is often expressed with 
certain  functional  words,  such  as  “because  of”, 
“due to”. In order to capture the various expres-
sions of these functional constructions, we iden-
tify all functional words around the given emo-
tion  keyword.  For  an  emotion  keyword,  we 
search  ‘left_0’  from  the  right  until  a  noun  or  a 
verb  is  found.  Next,  all  unigrams  and  bigrams 
between  the  noun  or  the  verb  and  the  emotion 
keyword  are  extracted.  The  same  applies  to 
‘right_0’. 
Long-distance 
constructions: 
Group II enumerates only some typical conjunc-
tion  words.  To  capture  more  general  rhetorical 
relations,  according  to  the  given  POS  tags,  the 
conjunction  word  is  extracted  for  each  cause 
candidate,  if  it  occurs  at  the  beginning  of  the 
candidate. 
Generalized  action  and  epistemic  verbs: 
Group  IV  and  V  cover  only  partial  action  and 
epistemic verbs. To capture possible related ex-
pressions,  we  take  the  advantage  of  Chinese 
characters. In Chinese, each character itself usu-
ally  has a  meaning  and  some  characters  have a 
strong capability to create words with extended 
meaning.  For  example,  the  character  “ting1-
listen” combines with other characters to create 

conjunction 

185

words expressing “listening”, such as ting1jian4, 
ting1wen5. With the selected characters regard-
ing  reported  verbs  and  epistemic  markers,  each 
cause  candidate  is  checked  to  see  whether  it 
contains the predefined characters.  

6  Experiments 

For  the  emotion  cause  corpus,  we  reserve  80% 
as  the  training  data,  10%  as  the  development 
data,  and  10%  as  the  test  data.  During  evalua-
tion, we first convert the multi-label tag output-
ted  from  our  system  into  a  binary  tag  (‘Y’ 
means the presence of a causal relation; ‘N’ in-
dicates the absence of a causal relation) between 
the  emotion  keyword  and  each  candidate  in  its 
corresponding  cause  candidates.  Thus, 
the 
evaluation scores for binary classification based 
on three common measures, i.e. precision, recall 
and F-score, are chosen. 

6.1  Linguistic Feature Analysis 

According to the distribution in Table 1, we de-
sign  a  naive  baseline  to  allow  feature  analysis. 
The  baseline  searches  for  the  cause  candidates 
in  the  order  of  <left_1,  right_0,  left_2,  left_0, 
right_1>.  If  the  candidate  contains  a  noun  or 
verb, consider this clause as a cause and stop. 

We  run  the  multi-label  system  with  different 
groups  of  features  and  the  performances  are 
shown  in  Table  5.  The  feature  set  begins  with 
linguistic patterns (LP), and is then incorporated 
with local functional constructions (LFC), long-
distance  conjunction  constructions  (LCC),  and 
generalized  action  and  epistemic  verbs  (GAE), 
one by one. Since the ‘N’ tag is overwhelming, 
we report only the Mac average scores for both 
‘Y’ and ‘N’ tags.  

In  Table  5,  we  first  notice  that  the  perform-
ances achieve significant improvement from the 
baseline  to  the  final  system  (~17%).  This  indi-
cates that our linguistic features are effective for 
emotion  cause  detection.  In  addition,  we  ob-
serve that LP and LFC are the best two effective 
features,  whereas  LCC  and  GAE  have  slight 
contributions.  This  shows  that  our  feature  ex-
traction  has  a  strong  capability  to  detect  local 
causal constructions, and is yet unable to detect 
the  long-distance  or  semantic  causal  informa-
tion.  Here,  ‘local’  refers  to  the  information  in 
the focus clause. We also find that incorporating 
LFC,  which  is  a  pure  local  feature,  generally 

improves  the  performances  of  all  cause  candi-
dates,  i.e.  ~5%  improvement  for  ‘left_1’.  This 
indicates  that  our  multi-label  integrated  system 
is able to convey information among cause can-
didates.

Table  6  shows  the  performances  (F-scores) 
for ‘Y’ and ‘N’ tags separately. First, we notice 
that  the  performances  of  the  ‘N’  tag  are  much 
better than the ones of ‘Y’ tag. Second, it is sur-
prising that incorporating the linguistic features 
significantly  improves  only  the  ‘Y’  tag  (from 
33% to  56%),  but  does  not  affect  ‘N’  tag.  This 
suggests that our linguistic features are effective 
to detect the presence of causal relation, and yet 
do  not  hurt  the  detection  of  ‘non_causal’  rela-
tion.  For  the  ‘Y’  tag,  the  features  LP  and  LFC 
achieve  ~15%  and  ~7%  improvements  respec-
tively.  LCC  and  GPE,  on  the  other  hand,  show 
slight improvements only. 

Finally,  Table  7  shows  the  detailed  perform-

ances of our multi-label system with all features. 
The last row shows the overall performances of 
‘Y’ and ‘N’ tags. For the ‘Y’ tag, the closer the 
cause  candidates  are  to  the  emotion  keyword, 
the  better  performances  the  system  achieves. 
This  proves  that  the  features  we  propose  effec-
tively  detect  local  emotion  causes,  more  effort,

however,  should  be  put  on  the  detection  of 
long-distance  causes.  In  addition,  we  find  that 
the  detection  of  long-distance  causes  usually 
relies on two kinds of information for inference: 
rhetorical  relation  and  deep  semantic  informa-
tion. 

6.2  Modeling Analysis 

To compare our multi-label model with single-
label models, we create a single-label system as 
follows.  The  single-label  model  is  a  binary 
classification for a pair comprising the emotion 
keyword  and  a  candidate  in  its  corresponding 
cause  candidates.  For  each  pair,  all  linguistic 
features  are  extracted  only  from  the  focus 
clause  and  its  corresponding  cause  candidate. 
Note that we only use the features in the focus 
clause for “left_0” and “right_0”. The perform-
ances are shown in Table 8. 

Comparing  Tables  7  and  8,  all  F-scores  of 
the  ‘Y’  tag  increase  and  the  performances  of 
the ‘N’ tag remain almost the same for both the 
single-label  model  and  our  multi-label  model. 
We  also  find  that  the  multi-label  model  takes 
more  advantage  of  local  information,  and  im-
proves 
for 
“left_1”.  

the  performances,  particularly 

To take an in-depth analysis of the cause de-
tection  capability  of  the  multi-label  model,  an 
evaluation  is  designed  that  the  label  is  treated 
as  a tag  from  the  multi-label  classifier.  Due to 
the tag sparseness problem (as in Table 2), only 

the  “left_2,  left_1”  tag  is  detected  in  the  test 
data,  and  its  performance  is  21%  precision, 
26%  recall  and  23%  F-score.  Furthermore,  we 
notice  that  ~18%  of  the  “left_1”  tags  are  de-
tected  through  this  combination  tag.  This 
shows  that  some  causes  need  to  take  into  ac-
count  the  mutual information  between  clauses. 
Although the scores are low, it still shows that 
our  multi-label  model  provides  an  effective 
way  of  detecting  some  of  the  multi-clauses 
causes. 

7  Conclusion 

We  treat  emotion  cause  detection  as  a  multi-
label  task,  and  develop  two  sets  of  linguistic 
features  for  emotion  cause  detection  based  on 
linguistic  cues.  The  experiments  on  the  small-
scale  corpus  show  that  both  the  multi-label 
model  and  the  linguistic  features  are  able  to 
effectively  detect  emotion  causes.  The  auto-
matic  detection  of  emotion  cause  will  in  turn 
allow us to extract directly relevant information 
for public opinion mining and event prediction. 
It  can  also  be  used  to  improve  emotion  detec-
tion  and  classification.  In  the  future,  we  will 
attempt  to  improve  our  system  from  two  as-
pects.  On  the  one  hand,  we  will  explore  more 
powerful  multi-label  classification  models  for 
our system. On the other hand, we will investi-
gate  more  linguistic  patterns  or  semantic  in-
formation to further help emotion cause detec-
tion.
