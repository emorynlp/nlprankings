Abstract

We propose the first unsupervised approach
to the problem of modeling dialogue acts in
an open domain. Trained on a corpus of
noisy Twitter conversations, our method dis-
covers dialogue acts by clustering raw utter-
ances. Because it accounts for the sequential
behaviour of these acts, the learned model can
provide insight into the shape of communica-
tion in a new medium. We address the chal-
lenge of evaluating the emergent model with a
qualitative visualization and an intrinsic con-
versation ordering task. This work is inspired
by a corpus of 1.3 million Twitter conversa-
tions, which will be made publicly available.
This huge amount of data, available only be-
cause Twitter blurs the line between chatting
and publishing, highlights the need to be able
to adapt quickly to a new medium.

1 Introduction

Automatic detection of dialogue structure is an im-
portant first step toward deep understanding of hu-
man conversations. Dialogue acts1 provide an
initial level of structure by annotating utterances
with shallow discourse roles such as “statement”,
“question” and “answer”. These acts are useful in
many applications, including conversational agents
(Wilks, 2006), dialogue systems (Allen et al., 2007),
dialogue summarization (Murray et al., 2006), and
flirtation detection (Ranganath et al., 2009).

Dialogue act tagging has traditionally followed an
annotate-train-test paradigm, which begins with the

∗This work was conducted at Microsoft Research.
1Also called “speech acts”

design of annotation guidelines, followed by the col-
lection and labeling of corpora (Jurafsky et al., 1997;
Dhillon et al., 2004). Only then can one train a tag-
ger to automatically recognize dialogue acts (Stol-
cke et al., 2000). This paradigm has been quite suc-
cessful, but the labeling process is both slow and
expensive, limiting the amount of data available for
training. The expense is compounded as we con-
sider new methods of communication, which may
require not only new annotations, but new annota-
tion guidelines and new dialogue acts. This issue be-
comes more pressing as the Internet continues to ex-
pand the number of ways in which we communicate,
bringing us e-mail, newsgroups, IRC, forums, blogs,
Facebook, Twitter, and whatever is on the horizon.

Previous work has taken a variety of approaches
to dialogue act tagging in new media. Cohen et al.
(2004) develop an inventory of dialogue acts specific
to e-mail in an office domain. They design their in-
ventory by inspecting a large corpus of e-mail, and
refine it during the manual tagging process. Jeong et
al. (2009) use semi-supervised learning to transfer
dialogue acts from labeled speech corpora to the In-
ternet media of forums and e-mail. They manually
restructure the source act inventories in an attempt
to create coarse, domain-independent acts. Each ap-
proach relies on a human designer to inject knowl-
edge into the system through the inventory of avail-
able acts.

As an alternative solution for new media, we pro-
pose a series of unsupervised conversation models,
where the discovery of acts amounts to clustering
utterances with similar conversational roles. This
avoids manual construction of an act inventory, and
allows the learning algorithm to tell us something
about how people converse in a new medium.

There is surprisingly little work in unsupervised
dialogue act tagging. Woszczyna and Waibel (1994)
propose an unsupervised Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) for dialogue structure in a meeting schedul-
ing domain, but model dialogue state at the word
level. Crook et al. (2009) use Dirichlet process mix-
ture models to cluster utterances into a flexible num-
ber of acts in a travel-planning domain, but do not
examine the sequential structure of dialogue.2

In contrast to previous work, we address the prob-
lem of discovering dialogue acts in an informal,
open-topic domain, where an unsupervised learner
may be distracted by strong topic clusters. We also
train and test our models in a new medium: Twit-
ter. Rather than test against existing dialogue inven-
tories, we evaluate using qualitative visualizations
and a novel conversation ordering task, to ensure our
models have the opportunity to discover dialogue
phenomena unique to this medium.

2 Data

To enable the study of large-data solutions to di-
alogue modeling, we have collected a corpus of
1.3 million conversations drawn from the micro-
blogging service, Twitter. 3 To our knowledge,
this is the largest corpus of naturally occurring chat
data that has been available for study thus far. Sim-
ilar datasets include the NUS SMS corpus (How
and Kan, 2005), several IRC chat corpora (Elsner
and Charniak, 2008; Forsyth and Martell, 2007),
and blog datasets (Yano et al., 2009; Gamon et al.,
2008), which can display conversational structure in
the blog comments.

As it characterizes itself as a micro-blog, it should
not be surprising that structurally, Twitter conversa-
tions lie somewhere between chat and blogs. Like
blogs, conversations on Twitter occur in a public en-
vironment, where they can be collected for research
purposes. However, Twitter posts are restricted to be
no longer than 140 characters, which keeps interac-
tions chat-like. Like e-mail and unlike IRC, Twit-
ter conversations are carried out by replying to spe-
cific posts. The Twitter API provides a link from
each reply to the post it is responding to, allowing

the models we present here.

accurate thread reconstruction without requiring a
conversation disentanglement step (Elsner and Char-
niak, 2008). The proportion of posts on Twitter that
are conversational in nature are somewhere around
37% (Kelly, 2009).

To collect this corpus, we crawled Twitter using
its publicly available API. We monitored the public
timeline4 to obtain a sample of active Twitter users.
To expand our user list, we also crawled up to 10
users who had engaged in dialogue with each seed
user. For each user, we retrieved all posts, retain-
ing only those that were in reply to some other post.
We recursively followed the chain of replies to re-
cover the entire conversation. A simple function-
word-driven filter was used to remove non-English
conversations.

We crawled Twitter for a 2 month period during
the summer of 2009. The resulting corpus consists
of about 1.3 million conversations, with each con-
versation containing between 2 and 243 posts. The
majority of conversations on Twitter are very short;
those of length 2 (one status post and a reply) ac-
count for 69% of the data. As shown in Figure 1, the
frequencies of conversation lengths follow a power-
law relationship.

While the style of writing used on Twitter is
widely varied, much of the text is very similar to
SMS text messages. This is likely because many
users access Twitter through mobile devices. Posts
are often highly ungrammatical, and filled with
spelling errors. In order to illustrate the spelling
variation found on Twitter, we ran the Jcluster word
clustering algorithm (Goodman, 2001) on our cor-

pus, and manually picked out clusters of spelling
variants; a sample is displayed in Table 1.

Twitter’s noisy style makes processing Twitter
text more difficult than other domains. While mov-
ing to a new domain (e.g. biomedical text) is a chal-
lenging task, at least the new words found in the
vocabulary are limited mostly to verbs and nouns,
while function words remain constant. On Twit-
ter, even closed-class words such as prepositions and
pronouns are spelled in many different ways.

3 Dialogue Analysis

We propose two models to discover dialogue acts in
an unsupervised manner. An ideal model will give
insight into the sorts of conversations that happen
on Twitter, while providing a useful tool for later
processing. We first introduce the summarization
technology we apply to this task, followed by two
Bayesian extensions.

3.1 Conversation model

Our base model structure is inspired by the con-
tent model proposed by Barzilay and Lee (2004)
for multi-document summarization. Their sentence-
level HMM discovers the sequence of topics used
to describe a particular type of news event, such as
earthquakes. A news story is modeled by first gen-
erating a sequence of hidden topics according to a
Markov model, with each topic generating an ob-
served sentence according to a topic-specific lan-
guage model. These models capture the sequential
structure of news stories, and can be used for sum-
marization tasks such as sentence extraction and or-
dering.

Our goals are not so different: we wish to dis-
cover the sequential dialogue structure of conversa-
tion. Rather than learning a disaster’s location is
followed by its death toll, we instead wish to learn
that a question is followed by an answer. An initial

Figure 3: Conversation + Topic Model

conversation model can be created by simply apply-
ing the content modeling framework to conversation
data. We rename the hidden states acts, and assume
each post in a Twitter conversation is generated by
a single act.5 During development, we found that a
unigram language model performed best as the act
emission distribution.

The resulting conversation model is shown as a
plate diagram in Figure 2. Each conversation C is
a sequence of acts a, and each act produces a post,
represented by a bag of words shown using the W
plates. The number of acts available to the model
is fixed; we experimented with between 5 and 40.
Starting with a random assignment of acts, we train
our conversation model using EM, with forward-
backward providing act distributions during the ex-
pectation step. The model structure in Figure 2 is

reasonable.

similar to previous HMMs for supervised dialogue
act recognition (Stolcke et al., 2000), but our model
is trained unsupervised.

3.2 Conversation + Topic model
Our conversations are not restricted to any partic-
ular topic: Twitter users can and will talk about
anything. Therefore, there is no guarantee that our
model, charged with discovering clusters of posts
that aid in the prediction of the next cluster, will nec-
essarily discover dialogue acts. The sequence model
could instead partition entire conversations into top-
ics, such as food, computers and music, and then pre-
dict that each topic self-transitions with high proba-
bility: if we begin talking about food, we are likely
to continue to do so. Since we began with a content
model, it is perhaps not surprising that our Conversa-
tion Model tends to discover a mixture of dialogue
and topic structure. Several high probability posts
from a topic-focused cluster discovered by EM are
shown in Table 2. These clusters are undesirable, as
they have little to do with dialogue structure.

In general, unsupervised sentence clustering tech-
niques need some degree of direction when a par-
ticular level of granularity is desired. Barzilay and
Lee (2004) mask named entities in their content
models, forcing their model to cluster topics about
earthquakes in general, and not instances of specific
earthquakes. This solution is not a good fit for Twit-
ter. As explained in Section 2, Twitter’s noisiness
resists off-the-shelf tools, such as named-entity rec-
ognizers and noun-phrase chunkers. Furthermore,
we would require a more drastic form of prepro-
cessing in order to mask all topic words, and not
just alter the topic granularity. During development,
we explored coarse methods to abstract away con-
tent while maintaining syntax, such as replacing to-
kens with either parts-of-speech or automatically-

generated word clusters, but we found that these ap-
proaches degrade model performance.

Another approach to filtering out topic informa-
tion leaves the data intact, but modifies the model
to account for topic. To that end, we adopt a Latent
Dirichlet Allocation, or LDA, framework (Blei et al.,
2003) similar to approaches used recently in sum-
marization (Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi
and Vanderwende, 2009). The goal of this extended
model is to separate content words from dialogue in-
dicators. Each word in a conversation is generated
from one of three sources:

• The current post’s dialogue act
• The conversation’s topic
• General English

The extended model is shown in Figure 3.6 In addi-
tion to act emission and transition parameters, the
model now includes a conversation-specific word
multinomial θk that represents the topic, as well as a
universal general English multinomial ψE . A new
hidden variable, s determines the source of each
word, and is drawn from a conversation-specific dis-
tribution over sources πk. Following LDA conven-
tions, we place a symmetric Dirichlet prior over
each of the multinomials. Dirichlet concentration
parameters for act emission, act transition, conver-
sation topic, general English, and source become the
hyper-parameters of our model.

The multinomials θk, πk and ψE create non-local
dependencies in our model, breaking our HMM dy-
namic programing. Therefore we adopt Gibbs sam-
pling as our inference engine. Each hidden vari-
able is sampled in turn, conditioned on a complete
assignment of all other hidden variables through-
out the data set. Again following LDA convention,
we carry out collapsed sampling, where the various
multinomials are integrated out, and are never ex-
plicitly estimated. This results in a sampling se-
quence where for each post we first sample its act,
and then sample a source for each word in the post.
The hidden act and source variables are sampled ac-
cording to the following transition distributions:

6This figure omits hyperparameters as well as act transition
and emission multinomials to reduce clutter. Dirichlet priors are
placed over all multinomials.

Ptrans(si,j |a, s−(i,j),w) ∝
P (si,j |s−(i,j))P (wi,j |a, s,w−(i,j))

These probabilities can be computed analogously to
the calculations used in the collapsed sampler for a
bigram HMM (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), and
those used for LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).

Note that our model contains five hyperparame-
ters. Rather than attempt to set them using an ex-
pensive grid search, we treat the concentration pa-
rameters as additional hidden variables and sample
each in turn, conditioned on the current assignment
to all other variables. Because these variables are
continuous, we apply slice sampling (Neal, 2003).
Slice sampling is a general technique for drawing
samples from a distribution by sampling uniformly
from the area under its density function.

3.3 Estimating Likelihood on Held-Out Data

In Section 4.2 we evaluate our models by comparing
their probability on held-out test conversations. As
computing this probability exactly is intractable in
our model, we employ a recently proposed Chibb-
style estimator (Murray and Salakhutdinov, 2008;
Wallach et al., 2009). Chibb estimators estimate the
probability of unseen data, P (w) by selecting a high
probability assignment to hidden variables h∗, and
taking advantage of the following equality which
can be easily derived from the definition of condi-
tional probability:

P (w) =
P (w,h∗)
P (h∗|w)

As the numerator can be computed exactly, this re-
duces the problem of estimating P (w) to the eas-
ier problem of estimating P (h∗|w). Murray and
Salakhutdinov (2008) provide an unbiased estimator
for P (h∗|w), which is calculated using the station-
ary distribution of the Gibbs sampler.

3.4 Bayesian Conversation model

Given the infrastructure necessary for the Conver-
sation+Topic model described above, it is straight-
forward to also implement a Bayesian version of

of the conversation model described in Section 3.1.
This amounts to replacing the add-x smoothing of
dialogue act emission and transition probabilities
with (potentially sparse) Dirichlet priors, and replac-
ing EM with Gibbs sampling. There is reason to
believe that integrating out multinomials and using
sparse priors will improve the performance of the
conversation model, as improvements have been ob-
served when using a Bayesian HMM for unsuper-
vised part-of-speech tagging (Goldwater and Grif-
fiths, 2007).

4 Experiments

Evaluating automatically discovered dialogue acts
is a difficult problem. Unlike previous work, our
model automatically discovers an appropriate set of
dialogue acts for a new medium; these acts will
not necessarily have a close correspondence to di-
alogue act inventories manually designed for other
corpora. Instead of comparing against human anno-
tations, we present a visualization of the automati-
cally discovered dialogue acts, in addition to mea-
suring the ability of our models to predict post order
in unseen conversations. Ideally we would evaluate
performance using an end-use application such as a
conversational agent; however as this is outside the
scope of this paper, we leave such an evaluation to
future work.

For all experiments we train our models on a set of
10,000 randomly sampled conversations with con-
versation length in posts ranging from 3 to 6. Note
that our implementations can likely scale to larger
data by using techniques such as SparseLDA (Yao
et al., 2009). We limit our vocabulary to the 5,000
most frequent words in the corpus.

When using EM, we train for 100 iterations, eval-
uating performance on the test set at each iteration,
and reporting the maximum. Smoothing parameters
are set using grid search on a development set.

When performing inference with Gibbs Sam-
pling, we use 1,000 samples for burn-in and take
10 samples at a lag of 100. Although using multi-
ple samples introduces the possibility of poor results
due to “act drift”, we found this not to be a problem
in practice; in fact, taking multiple samples substan-
tially improved performance during development.

Recall that we infer hyperparameters using slice

176



sampling. The concentration parameters chosen in
this manner were always sparse (< 1), which pro-
duced a moderate improvement over an uninformed
prior.

4.1 Qualitative Evaluation

We are quite interested in what our models can tell
us about how people converse on Twitter. To vi-
sualize and interpret our competing models, we ex-
amined act-emission distributions, posts with high-
confidence acts, and act-transition diagrams. Of
the three competing systems, we found the Conver-
sation+Topic model by far the easiest to interpret:
the 10-act model has 8 acts that we found intuitive,
while the other 2 are used only with low probabil-
ity. Conversely, the Conversation model, whether
trained by EM or Gibbs sampling, suffered from
the inclusion of general terms and from the confla-
tion of topic and dialogue. For example, the EM-
trained conversation model discovered an “act” that
was clearly a collection of posts about food, with no
underlying dialogue theme (see Table 2).

In the remainder of this section, we reproduce
our visualization for the 10-act Conversation+Topic
model. Word lists summarizing the discovered dia-
logue acts are shown in Table 3. For each act, the
top 40 words are listed in order of decreasing emis-
sion probability. An example post, drawn from the
set of highest-confidence posts for that act, is also
included. Figure 4 provides a visualization of the
matrix of transition probabilities between dialogue
acts. An arrow is drawn from one act to the next
if the probability of transition is above 0.15.7 Note
that a uniform model would transition to each act
with probability 0.10. In both Table 3 and Figure 4,
we use intuitive names in place of cluster numbers.
These are based on our interpretations of the clus-
ters, and are provided only to benefit the reader when
interpreting the transition diagram.8

From inspecting the transition diagram (Figure 4),
one can see that the model employs three distinct
acts to initiate Twitter conversations. These initial
acts are quite different from one another, and lead to

7After setting this threshold, two Acts were cut off from the
rest of the graph (had no incoming edges), and were therefore
removed

8In some cases, the choice in name is somewhat arbitrary,
ie: answer versus response, reaction versus comment.

Figure 4: Transitions between dialogue acts. See
table 3 for word lists and example posts for each act

different sets of possible responses. We discuss each
of these in turn.

The Status act appears to represent a post in which
the user is broadcasting information about what they
are currently doing. This can be seen by the high
amount of probability mass given to words like I
and my, in addition to verbs such as go and get, as
well as temporal nouns such as today, tomorrow and
tonight.

The Reference Broadcast act consists mostly of
usernames and urls.9 Also prominent is the word rt,
which has special significance on Twitter, indicating
that the user is re-posting another user’s post. This
act represents a user broadcasting an interesting link
or quote to their followers. Also note that this node
transitions to the Reaction act with high probability.
Reaction appears to cover excited or appreciative re-
sponses to new information, assigning high proba-
bility to !, !!, !!!, lol, thanks, and haha.

Finally Question to Followers represents a user
asking a question to their followers. The presence
of the question mark and WH question words indi-
cate a question, while words like anyone and know
indicate that the user is asking for information or an
opinion. Note that this is distinct from the Question
act, which is in response to an initial post.

Another interesting point is the alternation be-

9As part of the preprocessing of our corpus we replaced all
usernames and urls with the special tokens -usr- and -url-.

4.2 Quantitative Evaluation

Qualitative evaluations are both time-consuming
and subjective. The above visualization is useful for
understanding the Twitter domain, but it is of little
use when comparing model variants or selecting pa-
rameters. Therefore, we also propose a novel quan-
titative evaluation that measures the intrinsic qual-
ity of a conversation model by its ability to predict
the ordering of posts in a conversation. This mea-
sures the model’s predictive power, while requiring
no tagged data, and no commitment to an existing
tag inventory.

Our test set consists of 1,000 randomly selected
conversations not found in the training data. For
each conversation in the test set, we generate all
n! permutations of the posts. The probability of
each permutation is then evaluated as if it were an
unseen conversation, using either the forward algo-
rithm (EM) or the Chibb-style estimator (Gibbs).

Following work from the summarization community
(Barzilay and Lee, 2004), we employ Kendall’s τ to
measure the similarity of the max-probability per-
mutation to the original order.

The Kendall τ rank correlation coefficient mea-
sures the similarity between two permutations based
on their agreement in pairwise orderings:

τ =
n+ − n−(n

2

)
where n+ is the number of pairs that share the same
order in both permutations, and n− is the number
that do not. This statistic ranges between -1 and +1,
where -1 indicates inverse order, and +1 indicates
identical order. A value greater than 0 indicates a
positive correlation.

Predicting post order on open-domain Twitter
conversations is a much more difficult task than on
topic-focused news data (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).
We found that a simple bigram model baseline does
very poorly at predicting order on Twitter, achieving
only a weak positive correlation of τ = 0.0358 on
our test data as compared with 0.19-0.74 reported by
Barzilay and Lee on news data.

Note that τ is not a perfect measure of model qual-
ity for conversations; in some cases, multiple order-

ings of the same set of posts may form a perfectly
acceptable conversation. On the other hand, there
are often strong constraints on the type of response
we might expect to follow a particular dialogue act;
for example, answers follow questions. We would
expect an effective model to use these constraints to
predict order.

Performance at the conversation ordering task
while varying the number of acts for each model is
displayed in Figure 5. In general, we found that us-
ing Bayesian inference outperforms EM. Also note
that the Bayesian Conversation model outperforms
the Conversation+Topic model at predicting conver-
sation order. This is likely because modeling conver-
sation content as a sequence can in some cases help
to predict post ordering; for example, adjacent posts
are more likely to contain similar content words. Re-
call though that we found the Conversation+Topic
model to be far more interpretable.

Additionally we compare the likelihood of these
models on held out test data in Figure 6. Note that
the Bayesian methods produce models with much
higher likelihood.10 For the EM models, likelihood
tends to decrease on held out test data as we increase
the number of hidden states, due to overfitting.

5 Conclusion

We have presented an approach that allows the
unsupervised induction of dialogue structure from
naturally-occurring open-topic conversational data.

10Likelihood of the test data is estimated using the Chibb
Style estimator described in (Murray and Salakhutdinov, 2008;
Wallach et al., 2009). This method under-estimates likelihood
in expectation. The maximum likelihood (EM) likelihoods are
exact.

emerge from a stew of data that human readers find
difficult to follow. We have extended a conversa-
tion sequence model to separate topic and dialogue
words, resulting in an interpretable set of automat-
ically generated dialogue acts. These discovered
acts have interesting differences from those found
in other domains, and reflect Twitter’s nature as a
micro-blog.

We have introduced the task of conversation or-
dering as an intrinsic measure of conversation model
quality. We found this measure quite useful in
the development of our models and algorithms, al-
though our experiments show that it does not nec-
essarily correlate with interpretability. We have di-
rectly compared Bayesian inference to EM on our
conversation ordering task, showing a clear advan-
tage for Bayesian methods.

Finally, we have collected a corpus of 1.3 million
Twitter conversations, which we will make available
to the research community, and which we hope will
be useful beyond the study of dialogue. In the fu-
ture, we wish to scale our models to the full corpus,
and extend them with more complex notions of dis-
course, topic and community. Ultimately, we hope
to put the learned conversation structure to use in the
construction of a data-driven, conversational agent.
