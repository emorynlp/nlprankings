Abstract

The rapid growth of information sources
brings a unique challenge to biographical
information extraction: how to find specific
facts without having to read all the words.
An effective solution is to follow the human
scanning strategy which keeps a specific
keyword in mind and searches within a
specific scope. In this paper, we mimic a
scanning process to extract biographical
facts. We use event and relation triggers as
keywords, identify their scopes and apply
type constraints to extract answers within the
scope of a trigger. Experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods up to 26% absolute gain in F-score
without using any syntactic analysis or
external knowledge bases.

1 Introduction

Extracting biographical information is an impor-
tant task because it can help readers understand
an ongoing event more easily by providing the
background biographical information of participants
in this event. In fact, this task has been part of the
Text Analysis Conference (TAC) - Knowledge Base
Population (KBP) Slot Filling (SF) Track (Ji et al.,
2010; Ji et al., 2011; Surdeanu, 2013; Surdeanu and
Ji, 2014) for years.

Overall, state-of-the-art research still needs im-
provement. A typical approach is based on patterns
which include triggers (e.g., (Sun et al., 2011; Li et
al., 2012)). Here trigger is defined as the small-
est extent of a text which most clearly expresses

an event occurrence or indicates a relation type.
High-quality patterns yield quite high precision but
relatively low recall. In addition, it’s relatively
expensive to maintain and update a set of extraction
patterns.

Furthermore, we carefully investigated the TAC-
KBP SF 2012 ground truth corpus and find that
94.36% of the biographical facts are mentioned in a
sentence containing indicative fact-specific triggers.
For example, born is a trigger for extracting birth-
related facts. Triggers are crucial in predicting
the type of facts (Aguilar et al., 2014). However,
most previous studies only focused on using triggers
to create more patterns (e.g., (Li et al., 2013)).
Therefore the critical problem is how to make the
most of triggers in biographical fact extraction?

We observe that people tend to scan a document
when they want to quickly find a biographical fact
within limited time. According to Douglas and
Frazier (2001), scanning is a strategy for quickly
finding specific information (keywords or ideas) in
a text while ignoring its broader meaning. Scanning
involves skipping words, but the emphasis is that
the reader knows what to look for and rapidly
scans until words are found and closer reading can
occur (Phipps, 1983).

There are five steps in implementing scanning
strategy according to Arnold (1999):

1. Keep in mind what you are searching for.

2. Anticipate in what form the information is
likely to appear – number, proper nouns, etc.

3. Analyze the organization of the content before
starting to scan.

1203



4. Let your eyes run rapidly over several lines of
print at a time.

5. When you find the sentence that has the infor-
mation you seek, read the entire sentence.

Educators have verified that scanning is an ef-
fective strategy in enhancing reading comprehen-
sion (Motallebzadeh and Mamdoohi, 2011). There
are two important aspects in the scanning strategy:
keywords and their corresponding scopes. For bio-
graphical fact extraction, triggers can easily act as
the keywords used by human during scanning and
thus we focus on identifying the scopes of triggers.

Given a sentence that contains one or more trig-
gers, we define trigger scope as the shortest frag-
ment that is related to a trigger. Based on our
observation, each fact-specific trigger has its own
scope and its corresponding facts seldom appear
outside of its scope. In the following sentence, if
we can identify the scope of graduated, a trigger
for education-related facts, we can skip the rest of
the sentence after 1965 even though Chesterbrook
Academy is an educational organization.

She [<graduated> from Barnard in 1965] and
soon began teaching English at Chesterbrook A-
cademy in Pennsylvania.1

In this paper, we study the effect of triggers
by learning their linguistic scopes at the sentence
level and apply this strategy to extract 11 types of
biographical facts, namely, birth date, death date,
birth place, death place, residence place, education,
parents, spouse, children, siblings and other family
as described in the KBP SF task.

We design our extraction process following the
scanning steps corresponding to Arnold’s scanning
theory.

1. Let the computer know the query and the fact
type to be extracted.

2. Let the computer know what form or entity
type the candidate answer is likely to appear –
person, organization, phrase, time, etc.

3. Locate all the triggers of the given fact type and
recognize their respective scopes.

1The scope is marked with [] and the trigger is marked with
<>.

4. Within each scope, extract candidate answers
which satisfy the entity type constraint in 2.

The contributions of our paper are as follows.

• We are the first to study the application of
trigger scoping in biographical fact extraction.

• Our approach does not rely on any external
knowledge bases for training or manually cre-
ated fact-specific rules, and yet dramatically
advances state-of-the-art.

2 Approach

In this section, we present the detailed approach of
applying trigger scoping to biographical fact extrac-
tion. In Section 2.1, we first introduce the annotation
methods of constructing the gold-standard dataset
for evaluating scope identification. We use the
sentence in Figure 1 as our illustrative example.

triggers, we define trigger scope as the shortest
fragment that is related to a trigger. Based on
our observation, each fact-specific trigger has its
own scope and its corresponding facts seldom
appear outside of its scope. For example, in the
following sentence, if we can identify the scope
of graduated, a trigger for education-related facts,
we can skip the rest of the sentence after 1965 even
though Chesterbrook Academy is an educational
organization.

She [<graduated> from Barnard in 1965] and
soon began teaching English at Chesterbrook A-
cademy in Pennsylvania.1

In this paper, we study the effect of triggers
by learning their linguistic scopes at the sentence
level and apply this strategy to biographical fact
extraction on 11 biographical facts, namely, birth
date, death date, birth place, death place, resi-
dence place, education, parents, spouse, children,
siblings and other family as described in SF.

We design our extraction process following the
scanning steps corresponding to Arnold’s scan-
ning theory.

1. Let the computer know the query and the fact
to be extracted.

2. Let the computer know what form or entity
type the candidate answer is likely to appear
– person, organization, phrase, time, etc.

3. Locate all the triggers of the given fact and
recognize their respective scopes.

4. Within each scope, extract candidate answers
satisfying the entity type constraint in 2.

The contributions of our paper are as follows.

• We are the first to study the application of
trigger scoping in biographical fact extrac-
tion.
• The system does not rely on any external

knowledge bases for training or manually
created fact-specific rules, and yet dramati-
cally advances state-of-the-art.

2 Approach

In this section, we present an approach of applying
trigger scoping to biographical fact extraction,
with the sentence § as a walk-through example.
In Section 2.1, we first introduce the annotation
methods of constructing the gold-standard dataset
for the scope identification assessment.

1The scope is marked with [] and the trigger is marked
with <>.

Paul Francis Conrad and his [twin
<brother>, James], were [<born> in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 27, 1924],
[<sons> of Robert H. Conrad and Florence
Lawler Conrad].

2.1 Trigger and Scope Annotation
2.1.1 Basic issues
In a text, sentences with triggers of birth, death,
family, residence and education information are
considered for annotation. We will not annotate
a sentence if it inherently hints a biographical fact
without support of lexical evidence.

During the annotation, triggers are marked by
angle brackets: <resident>, <native>, etc. and
the scope of the trigger is denoted by square
brackets as shown in sentence §.
2.1.2 Trigger Tagging
We mined fact-specific trigger lists from existing
patterns, rules and ground truth sentences from
KBP 2012 SF corpus. Triggers for each fact are
also mined by mapping various knowledge bases,
including Wikipedia Infoboxes, Freebase (Bol-
lacker et al., 2008), DBPedia (Auer et al., 2007)
and YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), into the Gi-
gaword corpus2 and Wikipedia articles via distant
supervision (Mintz et al., 2009). In our experi-
ment, we use 343 triggers in total and for each fact
there are about 38 triggers in average.

We examine all the sentences containing any
possible triggers. The presence of a word in
one trigger list does not necessarily mean that the
sentence contains an event or a relation.

For instance, the second child in the following
sentence is part of an organization’s name.

He and his wife, Ann McGarry Buchwald moved
to Washington in 1963 with their [<child>], who
was adopted from orphanages and [<child> wel-
fare agencies] in Ireland, Spain and France.

We also keep such sentences and annotate their
trigger scopes without distinction.

We only mark the syntactic head of a trigger
phrase. Following this strategy, we mark children
for the noun phrase foster children.

2.1.3 Scope Tagging
During the scope annotation, we first include the
trigger within its own scope and then mark its

Figure 1: Trigger and scope annotation example.

2.1 Trigger and Scope Annotation

2.1.1 Basic issues
In a text, the sentences containing biographical

facts (e.g., birth, death, family, residence or educa-
tion) are considered for annotation. We discard a
sentence if it expresses a biographical fact without
surface cues.

During annotation, triggers are marked by angle
brackets (e.g., <resident>), and the scope bound-
aries of a trigger are denoted by square brackets as
shown in Figure 1.

2.1.2 Trigger Tagging
We mined fact-specific trigger lists from existing

patterns (Chen et al., 2010; Min et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2012) and ground truth sentences from KBP 2012

1204



SF corpus. In our experiment, we use 343 triggers
and 38 triggers on average for each fact type2.

We examine all the sentences containing any pos-
sible triggers. The presence of a word in one trigger
list does not necessarily mean that the sentence
contains an event or a relation. For instance, the
second child in the following sentence is part of an
organization’s name.

He and his wife, Ann McGarry Buchwald moved
to Washington in 1963 with their [<child>], who
was adopted from orphanages and [<child> wel-
fare agencies] in Ireland, Spain and France.

We also keep such sentences and annotate their
trigger scopes without distinction.

Note that we only mark the syntactic head of a
trigger phrase. For example, we mark child for the
noun phrase the second child.

2.1.3 Scope Tagging

During the scope annotation, we first include the
trigger within its own scope and then mark its left
and right boundaries. Usually the left boundary is
the trigger itself.

When there are multiple triggers in the same
sentence, we annotate each trigger’s scope separate-
ly since it is possible that the scopes of different
triggers are overlapped or nested as shown in the
following instance (the scope of daughters covers
the scope of wife):

Pavarotti had three [<daughters> with his first
wife, Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana; and one,
Alice, with his second wife].

Pavarotti had three daughters with his first
[<wife>], Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana; and
one, Alice, with his second [<wife>].

The scope of a word is not transitive. In the
phrase “his [<son>’s home] in Washington”, home
is within son’s scope and in Washington is within
home’s scope, however, the last prepositional phrase
is outside of son’s scope.

2.2 Scope Identification

We will introduce two methods for identifying trig-
ger scopes.

2The trigger lists are publicly available for research purposes
at: http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/data/triggers.zip

2.2.1 Rule-based Method
This method is used to investigate the perfor-

mance of trigger scoping strategy when we do not
have any labeled data. We use trigger as the left
scope boundary. A verb or trigger with other fact
types is regarded as the right boundary.

The rule-based scoping result of the walk-through
example is as follows:

Paul Francis Conrad and his twin [<brother>,
James, were] [<born> in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
on June 27, 1924,] [<sons> of Robert H.
Conrad and Florence Lawler Conrad.]

2.2.2 Supervised Classification
Alternatively we regard scope identification as a

classification task. For each detected trigger, scope
identification is performed as a binary classification
of each token in the sentence as to whether it is
within or outside of a trigger’s scope.

We apply the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit (Manning
et al., 2014) to annotate part-of-speech tags and
names in each document. We design the following
features to train a classifier.

• Position: The feature takes value 1 if the word
appears before the trigger, and 0 otherwise.

• Distance: The distance (in words) between the
word and the trigger.

• POS: POS tags of the word and the trigger.
• Name Entity: The name entity type of the

word.

• Interrupt: The feature takes value 1 if there is a
verb or a trigger with other fact type between
the trigger and the word, and 0 otherwise.
Verbs and triggers with other fact types can
effectively change the current topic or continue
in another way.

Note that the trained classifier can make predic-
tions that result in nonconsecutive blocks of scope
tokens. In this case, we aggregate the labels of all
the words of an entity to assign a global label, which
means that we assign the entity the majority label of
the words it contains.

2.3 Biographical Fact Extraction

For each relevant document of a given query, we use
Stanford CoreNLP to find the coreferential mentions
of the query and then return all the sentences which
contain at least one query entity mention. For
each trigger in a sentence, we extract the entities
which satisfy fact-specific constraints within its s-
cope. As shown in Figure 1, brother is the trigger
for per:siblings and the candidate fact should be a
person name. Thus we return all the person names
(e.g., James) within brother’s scope as the query
Paul’s siblings.

3 Experiments and Discussion

3.1 Data

We use the KBP 2012 and 2013 SF corpora as
the development and testing data sets respectively.
There are 50 person queries each year.

From the KBP 2012 SF corpus, we annotat-
ed 2,806 sentences in formal writing from news
reports as the gold-standard trigger scoping data
set. We randomly partitioned the labeled data and
performed ten-fold cross-validation using LIBSVM
toolkit (Chang and Lin, 2011). We employ the
classification model trained from all the labeled sen-
tences to classify tokens in the unlabeled sentences.

3.2 Results

3.2.1 Scope Identification
The scope identification evaluation results of the

rule-based method and the SVMs with the RBF

kernel are presented in Table 2. We can see that
the supervised classification method performs better
since it incorporates the weights of different features
rather than simply applying hard constraints. In
addition, it allows the answers to appear before a
trigger as shown in the following sentence. Our rule-
based method fails to extract Fred since it appears
before the trigger married:

She was a part of a group of black intellectuals
who included philosopher and poet [Fred Clifton,
whom she <married> in 1958].

Table 2: Scope identification results.

3.2.2 Biographical Fact Extraction
The fact extraction results in Table 1 demonstrate

our trigger scoping strategy can outperform state-of-
the-art methods. For a certain fact type, we choose
the SF system which has the best performance
for comparison. Specifically, we compare with
two successful approaches: (1) the combination of
distant supervision and rules (e.g., (Grishman, 2013;
Roth et al., 2013)); (2) patterns based on dependency
paths (e.g., (Li et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013)).

The advantage of our method lies in trigger-driven

1206



exploration. The positions of facts in the sentence
can be very flexible and therefore difficult to be
captured using a limited number of patterns. For
example, the patterns in table 23 fail to extract
James in Figure 1. However, the ways in which we
express the trigger and words it dominated tend to
be relatively fixed. For example, all the following
patterns contain a fact-specific trigger and also facts
usually appear within its scope.

PER:SIBLING
[Q] poss−1 brother appos [A]
[Q] appos−1 brother appos [A]
[Q] appos brother appos-1 [A]
[Q] nsubjpass−1 survived agent brother appos [A]
[Q] poss−1 sister appos [A]
[Q] appos−1 sister appos [A]
[Q] appos sister appos−1 [A]
[Q] nsubjpass−1 survived agent sister appos [A]

Table 3: Patterns used for extracting sibling facts (Li et
al., 2013). Q: Query, A: Answer.

The limitation of our method is that we assume
a sentence centers around only one person thus
every biographical fact mentioned should be related
to the centroid person. For example, our method
mistakenly extracted February as the death-date fact
for both Reina and Orlando in the following case.

Also at the mass was Reina Tamayo, the mother
of Orlando Zapata, who [<died> in February]
after an 85-day hunger strike to protest the fate of
political prisoners here.

In order to solve this problem, we need to further
analyze the relation between the query entity men-
tion and the trigger so that we can identify Orlando
Zapata is irrelevant to the death-related fact.

4 Related Work

Previous successful approaches to construct the bio-
graphical knowledge base are relatively expensive:
Distant Supervision (Surdeanu et al., 2010) re-
lies upon external knowledge bases and it is time-
consuming to manually write or edit patterns (Sun
et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012). The main impact of
our trigger scoping strategy is to narrow down the
text span of searching for facts, from sentence-level

3A poss−1 B means there is a possession modifier relation
(poss) between B and A.

to fragment-level. We only focus on analyzing the
content which is likely to contain an answer.

Our trigger scoping method is also partially in-
spired from the negation scope detection work (e.g.,
(Szarvas et al., 2008; Elkin et al., 2005; Chapman et
al., 2001; Morante and Daelemans, 2009; Agarwal
and Yu, 2010)) and reference scope identification in
citing sentences (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011; Abu-
Jbara and Radev, 2012).

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper we explore the role of triggers and their
scopes in biographical fact extraction. We imple-
ment the trigger scoping strategy using two simple
but effective methods. Experiments demonstrate
that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art with-
out any syntactic analysis and external knowledge
bases.

In the future, we will aim to explore how to
generate a trigger list for a “surprise” new fact type
within limited time.
