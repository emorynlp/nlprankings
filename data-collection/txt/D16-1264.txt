Abstract

We present the Stanford Question Answer-
ing Dataset (SQuAD), a new reading compre-
hension dataset consisting of 100,000+ ques-
tions posed by crowdworkers on a set of
Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each
question is a segment of text from the cor-
responding reading passage. We analyze the
dataset to understand the types of reason-
ing required to answer the questions, lean-
ing heavily on dependency and constituency
trees. We build a strong logistic regression
model, which achieves an F1 score of 51.0%,
a significant improvement over a simple base-
line (20%). However, human performance
(86.8%) is much higher, indicating that the
dataset presents a good challenge problem for
future research. The dataset is freely available
at https://stanford-qa.com.

1 Introduction

Reading Comprehension (RC), or the ability to read
text and then answer questions about it, is a chal-
lenging task for machines, requiring both under-
standing of natural language and knowledge about
the world. Consider the question “what causes pre-
cipitation to fall?” posed on the passage in Figure 1.
In order to answer the question, one might first lo-
cate the relevant part of the passage “precipitation ...
falls under gravity”, then reason that “under” refers
to a cause (not location), and thus determine the cor-
rect answer: “gravity”.

How can we get a machine to make progress
on the challenging task of reading comprehension?
Historically, large, realistic datasets have played

In meteorology, precipitation is any product
of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor
that falls under gravity. The main forms of pre-
cipitation include drizzle, rain, sleet, snow, grau-
pel and hail... Precipitation forms as smaller
droplets coalesce via collision with other rain
drops or ice crystals within a cloud. Short, in-
tense periods of rain in scattered locations are
called “showers”.

What causes precipitation to fall?
gravity

What is another main form of precipitation be-
sides drizzle, rain, snow, sleet and hail?
graupel

Where do water droplets collide with ice crystals
to form precipitation?
within a cloud

SQuAD dataset. Each of the answers is a segment of text from

the passage.

a critical role for driving fields forward—famous
examples include ImageNet for object recognition
(Deng et al., 2009) and the Penn Treebank for
syntactic parsing (Marcus et al., 1993). Existing
datasets for RC have one of two shortcomings: (i)
those that are high in quality (Richardson et al.,
2013; Berant et al., 2014) are too small for training
modern data-intensive models, while (ii) those that
are large (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015) are
semi-synthetic and do not share the same character-
istics as explicit reading comprehension questions.

To address the need for a large and high-quality
reading comprehension dataset, we present the Stan-

2383



ford Question Answering Dataset v1.0 (SQuAD),
freely available at https://stanford-qa.com, con-
sisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a
set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to ev-
ery question is a segment of text, or span, from the
corresponding reading passage. SQuAD contains
107,785 question-answer pairs on 536 articles, and
is almost two orders of magnitude larger than previ-
ous manually labeled RC datasets such as MCTest
(Richardson et al., 2013).

In contrast to prior datasets, SQuAD does not
provide a list of answer choices for each question.
Rather, systems must select the answer from all pos-
sible spans in the passage, thus needing to cope with
a fairly large number of candidates. While ques-
tions with span-based answers are more constrained
than the more interpretative questions found in more
advanced standardized tests, we still find a rich di-
versity of questions and answer types in SQuAD.
We develop automatic techniques based on distances
in dependency trees to quantify this diversity and
stratify the questions by difficulty. The span con-
straint also comes with the important benefit that
span-based answers are easier to evaluate than free-
form answers.

To assess the difficulty of SQuAD, we imple-
mented a logistic regression model with a range of
features. We find that lexicalized and dependency
tree path features are important to the performance
of the model. We also find that the model perfor-
mance worsens with increasing complexity of (i) an-
swer types and (ii) syntactic divergence between the
question and the sentence containing the answer; in-
terestingly, there is no such degradation for humans.
Our best model achieves an F1 score of 51.0%,1

which is much better than the sliding window base-
line (20%). Over the last four months (since June
2016), we have witnessed significant improvements
from more sophisticated neural network-based mod-
els. For example, Wang and Jiang (2016) obtained
70.3% F1 on SQuAD v1.1 (results on v1.0 are sim-
ilar). These results are still well behind human
performance, which is 86.8% F1 based on inter-
annotator agreement. This suggests that there is
plenty of room for advancement in modeling and
learning on the SQuAD dataset.

1All experimental results in this paper are on SQuAD v1.0.

2 Existing Datasets

We begin with a survey of existing reading com-
prehension and question answering (QA) datasets,
highlighting a variety of task formulation and cre-
ation strategies (see Table 1 for an overview).

Reading comprehension. A data-driven approach
to reading comprehension goes back to Hirschman
et al. (1999), who curated a dataset of 600 real 3rd–
6th grade reading comprehension questions. Their
pattern matching baseline was subsequently im-
proved by a rule-based system (Riloff and Thelen,
2000) and a logistic regression model (Ng et al.,
2000). More recently, Richardson et al. (2013) cu-
rated MCTest, which contains 660 stories created
by crowdworkers, with 4 questions per story and
4 answer choices per question. Because many of
the questions require commonsense reasoning and
reasoning across multiple sentences, the dataset re-
mains quite challenging, though there has been no-
ticeable progress (Narasimhan and Barzilay, 2015;
Sachan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Both curated
datasets, although real and difficult, are too small to
support very expressive statistical models.

Some datasets focus on deeper reasoning abili-
ties. Algebra word problems require understanding
a story well enough to turn it into a system of equa-

2384



tions, which can be easily solved to produce the an-
swer (Kushman et al., 2014; Hosseini et al., 2014).
BAbI (Weston et al., 2015), a fully synthetic RC
dataset, is stratified by different types of reasoning
required to solve each task. Clark and Etzioni (2016)
describe the task of solving 4th grade science exams,
and stress the need to reason with world knowledge.

Open-domain question answering. The goal of
open-domain QA is to answer a question from a
large collection of documents. The annual eval-
uations at the Text REtreival Conference (TREC)
(Voorhees and Tice, 2000) led to many advances
in open-domain QA, many of which were used in
IBM Watson for Jeopardy! (Ferrucci et al., 2013).
Recently, Yang et al. (2015) created the WikiQA
dataset, which, like SQuAD, use Wikipedia pas-
sages as a source of answers, but their task is sen-
tence selection, while ours requires selecting a spe-
cific span in the sentence.

Selecting the span of text that answers a question
is similar to answer extraction, the final step in the
open-domain QA pipeline, methods for which in-
clude bootstrapping surface patterns (Ravichandran
and Hovy, 2002), using dependency trees (Shen and
Klakow, 2006), and using a factor graph over mul-
tiple sentences (Sun et al., 2013). One key differ-
ence between our RC setting and answer extraction
is that answer extraction typically exploits the fact
that the answer occurs in multiple documents (Brill
et al., 2002), which is more lenient than in our set-
ting, where a system only has access to a single read-
ing passage.

Cloze datasets. Recently, researchers have con-
structed cloze datasets, in which the goal is to pre-
dict the missing word (often a named entity) in a
passage. Since these datasets can be automatically
generated from naturally occurring data, they can be
extremely large. The Children’s Book Test (CBT)
(Hill et al., 2015), for example, involves predicting
a blanked-out word of a sentence given the 20 previ-
ous sentences. Hermann et al. (2015) constructed a
corpus of cloze style questions by blanking out enti-
ties in abstractive summaries of CNN / Daily News
articles; the goal is to fill in the entity based on the
original article. While the size of this dataset is im-
pressive, Chen et al. (2016) showed that the dataset
requires less reasoning than previously thought, and

Figure 2: The crowd-facing web interface used to collect the
dataset encourages crowdworkers to use their own words while

asking questions.

concluded that performance is almost saturated.
One difference between SQuAD questions and

cloze-style queries is that answers to cloze queries
are single words or entities, while answers in
SQuAD often include non-entities and can be much
longer phrases. Another difference is that SQuAD
focuses on questions whose answers are entailed
by the passage, whereas the answers to cloze-style
queries are merely suggested by the passage.

3 Dataset Collection

We collect our dataset in three stages: curating
passages, crowdsourcing question-answers on those
passages, and obtaining additional answers.

Passage curation. To retrieve high-quality arti-
cles, we used Project Nayuki’s Wikipedia’s internal
PageRanks to obtain the top 10000 articles of En-
glish Wikipedia, from which we sampled 536 arti-
cles uniformly at random. From each of these ar-
ticles, we extracted individual paragraphs, stripping
away images, figures, tables, and discarding para-
graphs shorter than 500 characters. The result was
23,215 paragraphs for the 536 articles covering a
wide range of topics, from musical celebrities to ab-
stract concepts. We partitioned the articles randomly
into a training set (80%), a development set (10%),

2385



and a test set (10%).

Question-answer collection. Next, we employed
crowdworkers to create questions. We used the
Daemo platform (Gaikwad et al., 2015), with Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk as its backend. Crowdworkers
were required to have a 97% HIT acceptance rate, a
minimum of 1000 HITs, and be located in the United
States or Canada. Workers were asked to spend 4
minutes on every paragraph, and paid $9 per hour for
the number of hours required to complete the article.
The task was reviewed favorably by crowdworkers,
receiving positive comments on Turkopticon.

On each paragraph, crowdworkers were tasked
with asking and answering up to 5 questions on the
content of that paragraph. The questions had to be
entered in a text field, and the answers had to be
highlighted in the paragraph. To guide the work-
ers, tasks contained a sample paragraph, and exam-
ples of good and bad questions and answers on that
paragraph along with the reasons they were cate-
gorized as such. Additionally, crowdworkers were
encouraged to ask questions in their own words,
without copying word phrases from the paragraph.
On the interface, this was reinforced by a reminder
prompt at the beginning of every paragraph, and by
disabling copy-paste functionality on the paragraph
text.

Additional answers collection. To get an indica-
tion of human performance on SQuAD and to make
our evaluation more robust, we obtained at least 2
additional answers for each question in the develop-
ment and test sets. In the secondary answer gener-
ation task, each crowdworker was shown only the
questions along with the paragraphs of an article,
and asked to select the shortest span in the para-
graph that answered the question. If a question was
not answerable by a span in the paragraph, workers
were asked to submit the question without marking
an answer. Workers were recommended a speed of 5
questions for 2 minutes, and paid at the same rate of
$9 per hour for the number of hours required for the
entire article. Over the development and test sets,
2.6% of questions were marked unanswerable by at
least one of the additional crowdworkers.

Answer type Percentage Example

Date 8.9% 19 October 1512
Other Numeric 10.9% 12
Person 12.9% Thomas Coke
Location 4.4% Germany
Other Entity 15.3% ABC Sports
Common Noun Phrase 31.8% property damage
Adjective Phrase 3.9% second-largest
Verb Phrase 5.5% returned to Earth
Clause 3.7% to avoid trivialization
Other 2.7% quietly

Table 2: We automatically partition our answers into the fol-
lowing categories. Our dataset consists of large number of an-

swers beyond proper noun entities.

4 Dataset Analysis

To understand the properties of SQuAD, we analyze
the questions and answers in the development set.
Specifically, we explore the (i) diversity of answer
types, (ii) the difficulty of questions in terms of type
of reasoning required to answer them, and (iii) the
degree of syntactic divergence between the question
and answer sentences.

Diversity in answers. We automatically catego-
rize the answers as follows: We first separate
the numerical and non-numerical answers. The
non-numerical answers are categorized using con-
stituency parses and POS tags generated by Stan-
ford CoreNLP. The proper noun phrases are further
split into person, location and other entities using
NER tags. In Table 2, we can see dates and other
numbers make up 19.8% of the data; 32.6% of the
answers are proper nouns of three different types;
31.8% are common noun phrases answers; and the
remaining 15.8% are made up of adjective phrases,
verb phrases, clauses and other types.

Reasoning required to answer questions. To get
a better understanding of the reasoning required to
answer the questions, we sampled 4 questions from
each of the 48 articles in the development set, and
then manually labeled the examples with the cate-
gories shown in Table 3. The results show that
all examples have some sort of lexical or syntactic
divergence between the question and the answer in
the passage. Note that some examples fall into more
than one category.

tence S.

Stratification by syntactic divergence. We also
develop an automatic method to quantify the syntac-
tic divergence between a question and the sentence
containing the answer. This provides another way to
measure the difficulty of a question and to stratify
the dataset, which we return to in Section 6.3.

We illustrate how we measure the divergence with
the example in Figure 3. We first detect anchors
(word-lemma pairs common to both the question
and answer sentences); in the example, the anchor
is “first”. The two unlexicalized paths, one from

the anchor “first” in the question to the wh-word
“what”, and the other from the anchor in the answer
sentence and to the answer span “Bainbridge’s”, are
then extracted from the dependency parse trees. We
measure the edit distance between these two paths,
which we define as the minimum number of dele-
tions or insertions to transform one path into the
other. The syntactic divergence is then defined as
the minimum edit distance over all possible anchors.
The histogram in Figure 4a shows that there is a
wide range of syntactic divergence in our dataset.
We also show a concrete example where the edit dis-
tance is 0 and another where it is 6. Note that our
syntactic divergence ignores lexical variation. Also,
small divergence does not mean that a question is
easy since there could be other candidates with sim-
ilarly small divergence.

pare its accuracy with that of three baseline methods.

Figure 4: We use the edit distance between the unlexicalized dependency paths in the question and the sentence containing the
answer to measure syntactic divergence.

Candidate answer generation. For all four meth-
ods, rather than considering all O(L2) spans as can-
didate answers, where L is the number of words
in the sentence, we only use spans which are con-
stituents in the constituency parse generated by
Stanford CoreNLP. Ignoring punctuation and arti-
cles, we find that 77.3% of the correct answers in the
development set are constituents. This places an ef-
fective ceiling on the accuracy of our methods. Dur-
ing training, when the correct answer of an example
is not a constituent, we use the shortest constituent
containing the correct answer as the target.

5.1 Sliding Window Baseline

For each candidate answer, we compute the uni-
gram/bigram overlap between the sentence contain-
ing it (excluding the candidate itself) and the ques-
tion. We keep all the candidates that have the max-
imal overlap. Among these, we select the best
one using the sliding-window approach proposed
in Richardson et al. (2013).

In addition to the basic sliding window ap-
proach, we also implemented the distance-based ex-
tension (Richardson et al., 2013). Whereas Richard-
son et al. (2013) used the entire passage as the con-
text of an answer, we used only the sentence con-
taining the candidate answer for efficiency.

5.2 Logistic Regression

In our logistic regression model, we extract several
types of features for each candidate answer. We
discretize each continuous feature into 10 equally-
sized buckets, building a total of 180 million fea-
tures, most of which are lexicalized features or de-
pendency tree path features. The descriptions and
examples of the features are summarized in Table 4.

The matching word and bigram frequencies as
well as the root match features help the model pick
the correct sentences. Length features bias the
model towards picking common lengths and posi-
tions for answer spans, while span word frequencies
bias the model against uninformative words. Con-
stituent label and span POS tag features guide the
model towards the correct answer types. In addi-
tion to these basic features, we resolve lexical vari-
ation using lexicalized features, and syntactic varia-
tion using dependency tree path features.

The multiclass log-likelihood loss is optimized
using AdaGrad with an initial learning rate of 0.1.
Each update is performed on the batch of all ques-
tions in a paragraph for efficiency, since they share
the same candidates. L2 regularization is used, with
a coefficient of 0.1 divided by the number of batches.
The model is trained with three passes over the train-

Feature Groups Description Examples

Matching Word
Frequencies

Sum of the TF-IDF of the words that occur in both the question and the
sentence containing the candidate answer. Separate features are used
for the words to the left, to the right, inside the span, and in the whole
sentence.

Span: [0 ≤ sum < 0.01]
Left: [7.9 ≤ sum < 10.7]

Matching Bigram

Same as above, but using bigrams. We use the generalization of the
TF-IDF described in Shirakawa et al. (2015).

Span: [0 ≤ sum < 2.4]
Left: [0 ≤ sum < 2.7]

Root Match Whether the dependency parse tree roots of the question and sentence
match, whether the sentence contains the root of the dependency parse
tree of the question, and whether the question contains the root of the
dependency parse tree of the sentence.

Root Match = False

Lengths Number of words to the left, to the right, inside the span, and in the
whole sentence.

Span: [1 <= num < 2]
Left: [15 ≤ num < 19]

Span Word

ing data.

6 Experiments

6.1 Model Evaluation

We use two different metrics to evaluate model accu-
racy. Both metrics ignore punctuations and articles
(a, an, the).

Exact match. This metric measures the percent-
age of predictions that match any one of the ground
truth answers exactly.

(Macro-averaged) F1 score. This metric mea-
sures the average overlap between the prediction and
ground truth answer. We treat the prediction and
ground truth as bags of tokens, and compute their
F1. We take the maximum F1 over all of the ground
truth answers for a given question, and then average
over all of the questions.

6.2 Human Performance

We assess human performance on SQuAD’s devel-
opment and test sets. Recall that each of the ques-
tions in these sets has at least three answers. To eval-
uate human performance, we treat the second an-
swer to each question as the human prediction, and
keep the other answers as ground truth answers. The
resulting human performance score on the test set is
77.0% for the exact match metric, and 86.8% for F1.
Mismatch occurs mostly due to inclusion/exclusion
of non-essential phrases (e.g., monsoon trough ver-
sus movement of the monsoon trough) rather than
fundamental disagreements about the answer.

6.3 Model Performance

side human performance on the v1.0 of development

humans. We note that the model is able to select
the sentence containing the answer correctly with
79.3% accuracy; hence, the bulk of the difficulty lies
in finding the exact span within the sentence.

Feature ablations. In order to understand the fea-
tures that are responsible for the performance of the
logistic regression model, we perform a feature ab-
lation where we remove one group of features from
our model at a time. The results, shown in Table 6,
indicate that lexicalized and dependency tree path
features are most important. Comparing our analy-
sis to the one in Chen et al. (2016), we note that the
dependency tree path features play a much bigger
role in our dataset. Additionally, we note that with
lexicalized features, the model significantly overfits
the training set; however, we found that increasing
L2 regularization hurts performance on the develop-
ment set.

Performance stratified by answer type. To gain
more insight into the performance of our logistic re-
gression model, we report its performance across

the answer types explored in Table 2. The re-
sults (shown in Table 7) show that the model per-
forms best on dates and other numbers, categories
for which there are usually only a few plausible can-
didates, and most answers are single tokens. The
model is challenged more on other named entities
(i.e., location, person and other entities) because
there are many more plausible candidates. How-
ever, named entities are still relatively easy to iden-
tify by their POS tag features. The model performs
worst on other answer types, which together form
47.6% of the dataset. Humans have exceptional per-
formance on dates, numbers and all named entities.
Their performance on other answer types degrades
only slightly.

Performance stratified by syntactic divergence.
As discussed in Section 4, another challenging as-
pect of the dataset is the syntactic divergence be-
tween the question and answer sentence. Figure 5
shows that the more divergence there is, the lower
the performance of the logistic regression model.
Interestingly, humans do not seem to be sensitive
to syntactic divergence, suggesting that deep under-
standing is not distracted by superficial differences.
Measuring the degree of degradation could therefore
be useful in determining the extent to which a model
is generalizing in the right way.

7 Conclusion

Towards the end goal of natural language under-
standing, we introduce the Stanford Question An-
swering Dataset, a large reading comprehension
dataset on Wikipedia articles with crowdsourced
question-answer pairs. SQuAD features a diverse
range of question and answer types. The perfor-
mance of our logistic regression model, with 51.0%
F1, against the human F1 of 86.8% suggests ample
opportunity for improvement. We have made our
dataset freely available to encourage exploration of
more expressive models. Since the release of our
dataset, we have already seen considerable interest
in building models on this dataset, and the gap be-
tween our logistic regression model and human per-
formance has more than halved (Wang and Jiang,
2016). We expect that the remaining gap will be
harder to close, but that such efforts will result in
significant advances in reading comprehension.
