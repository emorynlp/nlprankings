Abstract 

This paper presents Brazilian Portuguese 
phoneme patterns of distribution, 

according to an automatic grammar rules-

based grapheme to phoneme converter. 
The software Nhenhém (Vasilévski, 

2008) was used for treating data: written 

texts which were decoded into 
phonologic symbols, forming a corpus, 

and subjected to a statistical analysis. 

Results support the high level of 

predictability of Brazilian Portuguese 
phonemes distribution, the consonant-

vowel syllabic pattern as the most 

common, as well as the stress pattern 
distribution 'CV.CV#. The efficiency of a 
phoneme-grapheme converter based 

entirely on rules is also proven. These 

results are displayed and discussed, as 
well as some aspects of Nhe-nhém 

building. 

1 Introduction 

The challenging problem of alphabetic systems 
discovery, i.e., its relationship with the spoken 

language (Silva Neto, 1988) is the issue 

discussed, illustrating it with empirical evidence, 
presenting statistically the Brazilian Portuguese 

patterns of phoneme distribution, and how they 

are reflected in the written system. In addition, 

questions dealing with prosody and syllable are 
also addressed, with some comments about the 

spelling agreement that is to be effected in 2013, 

the goal of which is to standardize the 
Portuguese spelling in seven countries where it is 

spoken.  

The patterns presented were obtained from the 
analysis of an automatic grammar rules-based 

grapheme to phoneme converter designed for 

dealing with Brazilian Portuguese, the software 

Nhenhém (Vasilévski, 2008), which is also a 

syllable parser. The presentation is preceded by a 
description of the relation between the 

Portuguese written system and the phonological 

one and the main problems they cause in finding 

optimal solutions for writing the program 
algorithms. Some of the principles of the 

Portuguese spelling system together with some 

of the theories that guided the converter 
construction support the discussion.  

2 Spoken and Written Language 

Science and also History (Silva Neto, 1988) state 
that the oral verbal language develops 
spontaneously whenever traces of humanization 

are found, whereas the written language is an 

invention, the intensive and systematic learning 

of which is necessary in most cases (Scliar-
Cabral, 2003a). Linguistic evolution is not just a 

fact of phonological and phonetic change, 

however, changes often start as pronunciation 
modifications (Silva Neto, 1988). Consequently, 

distinctions fade and disappear, causing 

homonyms, which must be avoided, so we 

introduce new words to maintain the 
independence of signs (Malmberg, 1993). 

Languages are in perpetual change, although in 

apparent repose. The distance between the oral 
and the written system, which is conservative 

and subject to the literary traditions, becomes 

increasingly high. 
In alphabetic systems, one or more letters 

(graphemes) represent the phonemes, resulting in 

units that distinguish meaning in writing (the 

second articulation), but this representation is not 
a one-to-one, by virtue of the distance between 

the oral and the written systems already 

mentioned. Another divergent principle also 
occurs: the etymological. Since many spellings 

are based upon etymological origin (Scliar-

Cabral, 2003a) writing does not reproduce the 

51



oral system faithfully. Both spoken and written 

language have their own laws and ways.  
 

2.1 Phonetics and Phonology 
 

While Phonetics is concerned with describing 
speech sounds (phones) from the point of view of 

their articulation, perception and physical 

properties, Phonology studies the phonemes of a 
language, that is, classes of sounds, abstractly 

represented in the minds of a linguistic 

community. In this way phonemic transcription 
is broad (general), covering all possible phonetic 

variations of each phoneme. The aim of 

Phonology is deep invariance, while Phonetics 

searches surface variations.  
There are many schools of Phonology, the 

most important of which is the Prague Circle, 

which introduced the functionalist approach, 
meaning, in this case, that only phonetic 

differences which cause differences of meaning 

are relevant. Perception of those differences is a 
psychic one and implies disregarding any similar 

phonetic difference which does not provoke a 

difference meaning. Phonology makes 

abstraction of the physical properties of sounds, 
which are the field of Phonetics. Quoting 

Glossematics, Phonetics studies the expression of 

sounds (substance of sounds in their multiplicity 
and variation), and Phonology studies the form 

(relations, classes, abstract nature, which takes 

place in the substance) (Malmberg, 1993).  

Since the alphabetic principles are based on 
the phoneme representation, any automatic 

program must depart from the phonological 

description of the respective language, which is 
the case of the Brazilian Portuguese phonological 

transcription here used.  

 

2.2 Brazilian Portuguese spelling system 
 

Although the rules of registering stress may seem 

complicated, they facilitate reading. We will 
present and discuss here only some of the most 

important rules regarding the spelling system.
1
 

Portuguese is a syllable-timed language, i.e., 
the vast majority of Portuguese words has 

stressed syllable, leaving aside clictics, which are 

only a few, but are the most frequently used 
(prepositions and accusative pronouns). 

However, the stressed syllable is not signaled for 

the most frequent stressed words (the ones which 

                                                        
1 Portuguese spelling accent system is showed in details and 
discussed in Vasilévski (2008). 

receive stress on the penultimate syllable) since 

Occam’s razor principle was adopted, registering 
only the stress of less frequent stressed words. 

The criteria for graphically signaling Portuguese 

words are the following: a) in which syllable 

stress falls; b) is it a vowel or consonant that 
ends the word; c) signaling the difference 

between diphthong and hiatus. 

Signaling graphically stress is a powerful 
hallmark for the reader, because it guides 

him/her to match the written word with its 

representation in the mental oral lexicon. Only 
meta-language is helpful whenever the diacritic 

is absent for recovering on which syllable stress 

falls.  

The stress diacritics of Portuguese are acute 
(“chapéu” – hat) and circumflex (“você” – you). 

A morphosyntactic diacritic is used for signaling 

the overlap of the preposition “a” with the 
definite article “a”/“as”, or with the 

demonstrative pronoun “a”/“aquela(s)”, 

“a”/“aquele(s)”. For instance, “fui à casa da 
Maria” (I went to Mary’s home), “vamos àquele 
lugar” (Let’s go to that place). 

In Portuguese, stress may relate to the last, 

penultimate, antepenultimate or, more rarely, to 
the fourth last syllable of the phonological word, 

for example, “núpcias” (wedding) → / ˈ nu.p ʲ
.si.aS/ (Câmara Jr., 1986). The phonological 
word in Portuguese is well defined, and its 

distinctive mark is stress (Câmara Jr., 1986). The 

stress position reveals, clearly, the distinctive 
vowel (Câmara Jr., 1997). 

The position of stress does not depend on the 

phonemic structure of the word. There are no 
word endings in Portuguese imposing certain 

stress, but there is a termination which is more 

frequent, although such frequency is 

indeterminable phonologically (Câmara Jr., 
1997). However, the Portuguese characteristic 

stress occurs in the penultimate syllable, which 

gives Portuguese a bass rhythm. Nevertheless, 
Brazilian Portuguese has more words with stress 

on the last syllable than European Portuguese, 

because it incorporated words from the African 
and Indigenous languages that lived together 

with the Portuguese colonialists in the past.  

Portuguese words main stress is registered 

graphically according to the pattern frequency in 
the language. The most frequent word pattern is: 

…'C(C)V.C(C)V(s)#, where the last vowel must 

be “a”, “e”, “o”. These words do not receive any 

written signal, e.g., “mesa” (table) → /ˈme.za/, 

52



“escreves” (you write) → /eS.ˈkrɛ.viS/, “livro” 
(book) → /ˈliv.ru/. Secondly is the pattern 
…'C(C)V(s)#, where the last written vowel must 

be “a”, “e”, “o”. If the last vowel is [-high, -low], 

it receives a circumflex, e.g., “avô” (grandfather) 

→ /a.ˈvo/; if the last vowel is [+low], it receives 

an acute signal, e.g., “sofá” (sofa) → /so.ˈfa/, 
“cafés” (coffes) → /ka.ˈfɛS/, “vovó” (grandma) 
→ /vo.ˈvɔ/. 

On the other hand, the stress of words ending 

with “i” and “u” – for instance, “abacaxi” 
(pineapple) and “caju” (cashew) – falls on the 

last syllable → /a.ba.ka.ˈʃi/ and /ka.ˈʒu/, unless 
they have accent mark on another syllable, e.g., 

“júri” (jury),“bônus” (bonus) → /ˈʒu.ri/, /ˈbo.nuS/.  
In Brazil, in most of sociolinguistic varieties, 

the unstressed final vowels spelled with “e” and 
“o” neutralize in favor of /i/ and /u/, respectively, 

when pronounced. This neutralization happens 

because, if the penultimate or antepenultimate 
syllable of the word is more intense, the last 

syllable is reduced: “gente” (people) → /ˈʒẽ.ti/, 
“carro” (car) → /ˈka.ʀu/.    

Also, stress of words ending in decrescent 

diphthongs fall on the last syllable: “plebeu” 

(commoner) → /ple.ˈbew/, “ramal” (branch) → 
/ʀa.ˈmaw/, “união” (union) → /u.ni.ˈãw/, unless 
they have accent mark on another syllable: 

“pônei” (pony) → /ˈpo.neϳ /. In Portuguese, all 
words stressed in the antepenultimate syllable are 

signaled in writing: “número” (number), “cálida” 

(warm – fem.), “zênite” (zenith) → /ˈnu.me.ru/, 
/ˈka.li.da/, /ˈze.ni.ti/.  

Another characteristic that makes the 
Portuguese system of signaling the stressed 

syllable in the written system effective comes 

from the fact that it was guided by phonological 

intuition. One example is a morphosyntactic 
diacritic exclusive of certain verbs – “ter” (to 

have), “vir” (to come), and derivatives – in the 

third person plural (“têm”, “vêm”) (Scliar-
Cabral, 2003a), thus indicating plural, since third 

person singular is “tem” and “vem”). The 

pronunciation, however, does not change: “vem”, 

“vêm” → /vẽϳ/, /ˈvẽϳ/.  
In summary, the Portuguese written system of 

signaling stress is based on the principle of 

economy (Occam’s razor), considering that the 
most frequent pattern /'CV.CV(s)/ is the one that 

does not receive a diacritic. Thus, it facilitates 

decoding, although it may seem more 
complicated for coding, especially as it is not 

properly understood by teachers and, therefore, 

by students. The system has lost some of the 

qualities based on phonological intuition, due to 
diachronic changes in the oral system and the 

lack of spelling rules based on those changes: the 

1991 agreement made the situation worse. We 
will come back to this point. 

 

2.3 The Portuguese syllable 
 

The syllable is the superior unit in which 

phonemes (vowels and consonants) combine to 

work on enunciation (Câmara Jr., 1997). Syllable 
division is deeply studied by Phonology. Its 

structure types characterize languages. The basic 

phonemic structure is the syllable, not the 

phoneme (Jakobson, 1967 apud Câmara Jr., 
1986). The syllable in Portuguese can be 

understood as a set of positions (slope (onset), 

core (nucleus), and decline (coda)) to be 
occupied by specific phonemes. The core of the 

syllable is the only essential position in 

Portuguese and should be always occupied by a 

vowel, which is the predominant sound of the 
syllable. The slope is occupied by consonants 

and may not be present in the syllable. Further 

restrictions are made to what may be in decline, 
which accepts only certain consonants and the 

semi-vowels /j/, /w/, but can also be empty. In 

Portuguese the so called free or open syllables, 
which are the ones that end with a vowel, 

predominate. This kind of syllables includes 

simple syllables (V) and open complex (CV). 

Locked or closed syllables are those ending in 
consonants (VC, CV(C)C). They are much less 

frequent in Portuguese, and there are severe 

constraints, limiting which are the possible 
consonants in this position (Câmara Jr., 1986).  

The most complex syllables in Portuguese are 

the ones that end with two or three phonemes: 

CCVVC (“claus.tro.fo.bi.a” → /klawSklawSklawSklawS.tro.fo. ˈ
bi.a/), CCVCC (“trans.mu.ta.ção” → 
/traNS.traNS.traNS.traNS.mu.ta. ˈ sawN/ ~ /trãStrãStrãStrãS.mu.ta. ˈ sãw/), and 
CVCCC (“gangs.te.ris.mo” → /gaNgaNgaNgaN.gggg ʲ̡̡̡ SSSS.te. ˈ
riS.mu/ ~ /gãgãgãgã.gggg ʲ̡̡̡SSSS.te. ˈ riS.mu/). In the last two 
examples, we can see that there can be two 

phonological interpretations: the first one 

considers the existence of nasal consonantal coda 

and disregards the existence of nasal vowels 
while the second considers the existence of nasal 

53



vowels and the absence of a nasal consonant 

phoneme in coda position (what the second 
position admits is the existence of phonetic 

variants, conditioned by the subsequent 

consonant). Nhenhém spelling syllable parsing 

favors the second position. The sequence CCCV 
is not valid for Brazilian Portuguese. The 

pronunciation of a foreign word like stress is 

[is.ˈtrɛ.si], so its written form is “es-tresse”. 
In general, the Portuguese syllable 

delimitation is clear, but there are three cases 

where it is floating. There are three groups of 
vowels contexts in which an unstressed and high 

vowel may be considered as a semi-vowel, 

belonging to a diphthong, or as a vowel, forming 
a hiatus (Câmara Jr., 1997): a) /i/ or /u/ preceded 

or followed by another unstressed vowel 

(“variedade”, “saudade”, “cuidado”), b) /i / or /u/ 
followed by a stressed vowel (“piano”, “viola”), 
and c) /i/ or /u/ followed by unstressed vowel at 

the word ending (“índia”, “assíduo”). 
Phonetically, one can understand these as 
diphthongs or hiatuses in free variation with no 

distinctive opposition. Phonologically, however, 

there is a syllabic not significant variable 
boundary. In Brazilian Portuguese, they are 

better understood as hiatus (/va.ri.e.ˈda.di/, 
/pi.ˈã.nu/, /vi.ˈɔ.la/, /ˈĩ.di.a/, /a.ˈsi.du.u/), except in 
the cases in which the second vowel is “i” ou 

“u”, which are better understood as diphthongs: 

/saw.ˈda.di/, /kuϳ.ˈda.du /.  
The above explanation is part of the theory 

that sustains Nhenhém rules.  

3 Methodology, discussion and results  

In this section, we present the methodology 
apllied to the work corpus and the automatic 

decoder Nhenhém, due to the close relation 

between them. For the same reason, also we 

present the results and discuss them.  
 

3.1 The decoder Nhenhém: presentation 
 
The word that gives the program its name, 

“nhenhém”, comes from the Tupi language – 

spoken by several Indian tribes who lived and 

continue living in Brazil – and means the 
endlessly repetition of a movement made by the 

lips, a sound, as the voice, therefore, an analogue 

of the word could be “bla, bla, bla”. 
Nhenhém (/ɲẽ.ˈɲẽϳ/) is a computational 

program that decodes Brazilian’s official writing 

system into phonological symbols and marks 

prosody. This program was used for translating, 
editing, grouping, and searching the work corpus.  

What inspired the software development, in 

2008, was the high level of transparency of 

Brazilian Portuguese alphabetic system, although 
there are some problems, namely the fact the 

same grapheme “e” or “o” represents 

respectively two different vowels, /e/, /ɛ/ and /o/, 

/ɔ/. So, the hypothesis of the availability of the 
high level of predictability of that system guided 

the building of a software based on rules, which 
automatically converted graphemes into 

phonemes. 

Methodologically, the applicative 

development associates Computational 
Linguistics, Corpus Linguistics, Statistics, 

Phonology, and Phonetics. Since the program 

planning combined proper methodology and 
linguistic theory, the software could be built in a 

computer programming language which is not 

specifically planned for the treatment of human 

language. 
The symbols Nhenhém uses for the 

conversions are displayed in Tab.1.

3.2 Nhenhém performance 
 

The computational tool we present here is based 
on rules, i.e., we did not use machine learning 

based on a training dictionary. Grammatical rules 

were converted into algorithms and tested within 
the corpus. A deep and exhaustive study of the 

grammatical rules that govern the Portuguese 

written system preceded the design of the tool, 

consulting the literature on the subject. 
Internally, the program has all written Portuguese 

spelling rules (Câmara Jr., 1997, 1986, 1977; 

Scliar-Cabral, 2003a; Said Ali, 1964; Bechara, 
1973; Bisol, 1989; Cagliari, 2002) converted into 

algorithms, and also the entire Portuguese 

prosodic system, as it was created by Gonçalves 

Vianna in 1911, briefly adjusted in 1945 and in 
1973 (Bechara, 1973, Scliar-Cabral, 2003a). If 

the word stress is signaled graphically, the 

converter reproduces it, if not, Nhenhém applies 
the spelling rules presented in section 2.2.  

Nhenhém bases the translation on a 

phonologic alphabet, which takes into account 
the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA, 2012) 

fonts, but it gives responses in Arial Unicode MS 

font (Tab.1). There are no statistics associated to 

the rules of grammar. We are not worried by the 
fact that language has many rules: what really 

matters is that they are general, and that there are 

rules for the exceptions as well. Unfortunately, 
some exceptions escape this principle, and 

became unpredictable, due to the lack of rules. 

As a result, they are responsible for about 5% or 
less of Nhenhém translation inaccuracy. We will 

discuss some of them later.  

The software reads relatively huge bunches of 

data, and bestow phonologic reports with 
statistical reports. Examining a phonologic 

corpus rightly assembled, tests done by drawing 

on the applicative showed that it reaches no less 
than 98% of accuracy, reproducing the portion of 

the Brazilian writing system that is predictable 

by decoding rules. In relation to the written 

system as a hole, the correctness is not less than 

55



95%. It is known that, to implement the rules in 

certain groups, it is important to identify the 
syllabic unit (Almeida & Simões, 2001; Candeias 

& Perdigão, 2008), however, the first version of 

Nhenhém (2008) reached at least 95% of 

accuracy without recognizing the syllabic unit. 
Such accuracy was measured by testing several 

texts with the program. This means that, as soon 

as we approach this issue properly, the results 
shall become better. Besides this performance, 

the program also reaches at least 99% of 

precision at signaling words stress. Such results 
confirm the hypotheses, and authenticate the high 

level of predictability of Brazilian alphabetic 

system, thanks to its phonological basis. It also 

corroborates that the Brazilian alphabetic system 
represents the prosody in a logical, accurate, 

economic and effective manner. 

The program does not fulfill some aspects of 
translating the written texts into phonological 

transcription, but this happens because there are 

some exceptions in the Portuguese written 
system. For instance, in some cases, the letter “x” 

values are not all predictable by rules. It can be 

decoded as five different phonemes: /ʃ /, /s/, /z/, 

/kʲS/, |S|. For example: “graxa”, “sintaxe”, 

“exame”, “nexo”, “texto” → /ˈgra.ʃa/, /sĩ.ˈta.ssssi/, 
/e.ˈzzzzã.mi/, /ˈnɛ.kkkkʲ.sʲ.sʲ.sʲ.su/, /ˈteSSSS.tu/. The first two 
examples represent the unpredictable cases.  

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

There are also some cases of ambiguity, for 

instance, the letter “s” value after “b”, e.g.: 

“observar” (to observe) → /obʲseRˈvaR/, 
“obséquio” (favor) → /obʲˈzɛkiu/. So, we consider 
that “s” as representing an archiphoneme: /obʲSer
ˈvaR/ and /obʲˈSɛkiu/ (Vasilévski, 2010).  

Morphology can also provoke unpredictable 
situations. For example, the prefix “trans-”, 

which means “accross”, causes a pronunciation 

ambiguity: “transamazônica” (trans+amazônica) 

is correctly decoded /trã.za.ma.ˈzo.ni.ka/, but 
“transiberiana” (trans+siberiana) is decoded 

*/trã.zi.be.ri.ˈã.na/ instead of /trã.si.be.ri.ˈã.na/, 
because there is resyllabification. How to instruct 

a rules-based program that a rule can either be 

applied or not for the same situation?  

This problem can only be solved by 
associating morphologycal and phonological 

rules in the program. We approached this issue 

deeply in a previous work (Vasilévski, 2008). 
For now, the solution is to edit the translated text 

so as to correct all these failures. 

Furthermore, the vowels [+low] /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ are 
written “e” and “o”, as mentioned, which makes 

it hard to predict their values, since /o/ and /e/ 

have the  same  coding. When  they  are  stressed

and also signaled graphically, the conversion is 

correct. The reduction of pre-tonic and pos-tonic 
vowels is also not properly addressed in the 

Nhenhém algorithm.  

Moreover, we decided to consider the so 

called raising or crescent diphthong as hiatus 
(Câmara Jr. 1986; Bisol, 1989), therefore words 

with this ending are decoded  as  receiving  stress 

on  the  antepenultimate  syllable:  “ósseo”  →    

/ ˈ ɔ.si.u/, “história” → /iS. ˈ tɔ.ri.a/, “náusea” →      
/ˈnaw.zi.a/, “ócio” → /ˈɔ.si.u/.  

In 2010, Nhenhém was translated into another 
computer language, and so we could improve its 

performance. We incremented the main 

algorithm so that the system became capable of 
providing the phonological syllabic division, and, 

consequently, the spelling syllabic division, with 

at least 99% accuracy.  In this way it became 
easy to signal the stressed syllable, since its 2008 

version signaled only the stressed vowel. We 

used this renewed algorithm to make an 

automatic syllable parsing for Brazilian 
Portuguese (Vasilévski, 2010), and we had to 

solve the problem of syllabication of words that 

contained hyphen, such as “beija-flor” 
(hummingbird), “pé-de-moleque” (a peanut 

candy), “dever-se-ia” (verb to have a duty, 

conjugated for third person singular, Past Future 
Indicative, synthetic passive voice, with 

mesoclisis), and solved them (Vasilévski, 2011).  

In addition, we built an interface between 

Nhenhém and the software Laça-palavras 
(Vasilévski & Araújo, 2010; Scliar-Cabral & 

Vasilévski, 2011), which is used for linguistic 

research. Furthermore, we used the Nhenhém 
prosodic-phonological algorithm for building a 

program for speech therapy (Blasi & Vasilévski, 

2011), consulting specific literature (Scliar-

Cabral, 2003b). This program has been tested 
and the results were encouraging (Garcez, Blasi, 

Vasilévski, 2011).  

The text is converted while the user types it or 
pastes it. Pasted texts must have simple 

formatting, that is, no capital letters. The stressed 

vowel is signaled by an order from the user. Fig. 
1 shows the result for the text “ameixas ame-as

Leminski (1991). 

The Nhenhém user can automatically convert 

either one word or a 20 pages text, edit it, save it, 
research it and print it. As the system conversion 

is rightly esteemed on at least 95% of accuracy, 

it allows the user to edit the unsolved 5% (or 

less) failure rate text, converting, replacing and 
inserting symbols, adjusting to dialects. The 

program also allows several texts to be recorded 

in a database for specific use in statistical reports.  
 

3.3 Phonologic Corpus  
 
In order to test Nhenhém, and also to investigate 

phonologic patterns of Brazilian written 

Portuguese, we assembled a corpus with six 

articles, published in 2007 in a journal of 
Brazilian dentistry. They are technical and 

scientific texts, revised, and updated, which were 

not produced to be used in linguistics research 
(Sinclair, 1991; Leech, 1992).  

The six texts were pre-edited in a text editor, 

individually, before pasting on Nhe-nhém. 
Foreign words, words that contained graphemes 

that do not belong to Portuguese written system 

and measurement units were eliminated, as well 

as some acronyms. Some of them could be 
replaced by its spelling form. The system 

excludes punctuation, hyphen, quotation marks, 

and some other symbols by itself, so, they do not 
need to be treated previously.  

In order to reduce chances of conversion 

errors, care must be taken to ensure the texts’ 

perfect readability by Nhenhém. After this 
preparation, the corpus texts were pasted on the 

program, converted, printed, checked, edited, re-

checked, and saved for research. The exceptions 
were searched and edited so as to obtain text 

correct translations. The texts were loaded for 

generating statistical reports: the numbers, which 
will be now exposed, were generated and, as 

such, are reliable.  

 

3.4 Statistical Report: The Phonologic 
Patterns 

 

The corpus, after conversion, totalized 69,787 
phonemes, being distributed into 33,226 syllabic 

phonemes (vowels), 3,069 non-syllabic 

phonemes (semi-vowels), and 33,492 consonant 
phonemes. Such numbers represent 47.61%, 

4.40%, and 47.99% respectively of the total.  

To confirm the results, we tested only one of 

the six texts belonging to the corpus (10,904 
phonemes), the numbers of which we present in 

details (Fig. 2). The main features (traços 

57



principais) distribution is: 47.98% syllabic 

phonemes, 3.85% non-syllabic phonemes, and 
48.17% consonant phonemes. The results are 

very similar.  

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

In regard to the vowels (fonemas vocálicos), 
their distribution is: Tongue position: 42.09% 

front, 57.91% back; Tongue height: 44.29% 

high, 24.36% mid, 31.36% low; Airstream way 

(refers to the route taken by the air flow during 
vocalization): 87.99% oral, 12.01% nasal; Lip 

rounding: 30.31% rounded, 69.69% unrounded. 

The distribution of consonants is: Manner of 
articulation: 51.88% occlusive, and 48.12% 

constrictive, distributed as follows: 58.96% 

fricative, 31.02% vibrating, 10.01% lateral; Place 
of articulation: 63.58% front, 16.70% back, 

19.73% labial; Airstream way: 90.73% oral, 

9.27% nasal (oral and nasal); Phonation: 48.95% 

unvoiced, 51.05% voiced – the archiphonemes 
|S| and |R| are not included in these numbers, 

because they neutralize features.  

Also, the statistical report (Relatório 

estatístico fonológico) provides phoneme 
individual distribution, as Tab. 2 displays for the 

10,904 phonemes text.

Table 2: Corpus phoneme individual 
distribution 

 

A journalistic text composed by 8,454 
phonemes was prepared and tested individually 

by Nhenhém, and the results were similar, since 

the differences were around 1%. So, the results 
and also the numbers that show the phonologic 

patterns of Brazilian Portuguese seem reliable. 

We tried to find another program or even study 

that approaches this issue in a similar way, that 
is, a one that determines the segments from their 

features and inform such statistics, using corpus, 

but we did not find any. So, for awhile, we could 
not make comparisons in order to confirm the 

reliability of the numbers we have presented.  

A lot can be discussed about the results, but 
we will make general comments here. The back 

or posterior vowels occur around 15% plus than 

the front or minus posterior vowels. The 

posterior ones that appear most are /a/ and /u/, 
and, among the front, /i/, which occurs only 1% 

less than /a/. So, the vowel that occurs most in 

Portuguese is /a/, closely followed by /i/.  

The semi-vowel / ϳ̃̃/ occurs only in the word 
“muito” (many, much) → /'muϳ.̃̃tu/ and derived 
forms. The /ʲ/ is computed with /i/, since the first 
occurs when in a word there is a sequence of two 

consonants which ordinarily are not a coda, and 

belong to different syllable. In this case, the 
epenthetic /ʲ/ occurs while such sequence is 

pronounced. So, this inserted phoneme works as 

core of a phonological syllable: “opção” (option), 

“cacto” (cactus) → /o.pʲ.'sãw/, /ka.kʲ.tu/.  
In relation to the consonant phonemes, there is 

balance in the occurrence of constrictive and 

occlusive, although occlusive always occur 
around 3% more than the constrictive ones.  

 From the results, we find that Brazilian 

Portuguese phonemic distribution is uniform, 
once the amount of vowels and consonants tend 

to be around 50% each. Furthermore, it is 

possible to deduce that CV (consonant+vowel) is 

the most common syllable pattern of Brazilian 

Portuguese. The semi-vowels reveal the amount 
of diphthongs (the real ones, that is, falling or 

decrescent diphthongs), since the semi-vowels 

only occur in this case.  

We believe that a deeper analysis of these 
numbers can be very useful for Portuguese 

language research. 

 

3.5 The Spelling Agreement of 1991 (2009) 
 

Some changes are to occur in Brazilian 
Portuguese spelling, due to a spelling agreement, 

according to which at least seven of the countries 

where Portuguese is spoken must use the same 

spelling, from 2013 on.  
The most important change for Brazilian 

Portuguese is the exclusion of the shudder 

(“trema”), since recognizing diacrisis becomes 
unpredictable, e.g., the pronunciation of “u” on 

digraphs “gü” and “qü”. Thus, “agüentar” (to 

stand) and “eqüino” (horse), until 2013 correctly 
decoded as /agwẽˈtaR/ and /eˈkwinu/, will be 

spelled “aguentar” and “equino”, generating the 

translations */agẽˈtaR/ and */eˈkinu/. In Brazil, 

shudder use is still very common. For these 
reason, Nhenhém will preserve this resource in 

its algorithm.  

This means that the alphabetic system loses 
transparency, that is, loses one of the rules that 

make it predictable; therefore, reading 

(decoding) is impaired. Other changes interfere 

less in the automatic translation, but none of 
them disturbs the prosody system.  

4 Conclusion and Outlooks 

The experience of building, testing and using 

Nhenhém has shown the degree of linguistic 
texts electronic reading and conversion 

difficulty. The phonemic level is the easiest to 

systematize, the difficulty is greater for the 
syllable level, the morphology level comes next 

and then the syntax, which is more intricate. The 

complexity of each level may be attenuated by 

the systematization of previous levels, because 
one takes advantage of the other systematization. 

So, converters like Nhenhém are a step for future 

work on levels that transcend the phoneme, like 
we did to the syllable.  

Some decisions taken in the system building 

are objectionable to some and noteworthy to 
others, as are some of theories chosen. However, 

this was not optional. The choices came from the 

need imposed by the programming and, within 

59



that, objectivity and intelligibility of existing 

theories, and beliefs and intuition of teachers, 
students and other language users. The efficiency 

of Nhenhém confirms the usefulness of the 

theories adopted.  

Now that we have made the automatic 
syllable parsing, the project follows. We have 

been working at making the statistical report to 

look directly to the syllable, and we believe the 
results will be worthwhile. Some of the next 

steps are to build a voice synthesizer from 

Nhenhém, and improve Nhenhém Fonoaud, 
which is the program for speech therapy. Also, 

we are working on rules for reducing that 5% (or 

less) failure rate at the conversion. Since the 

conversion tool successfully exploits the close 
correspondence between orthographic 

representation and pronunciation in Brazilian 

Portuguese, it can prove to be useful in a range of 
applications, like in speech therapy.
