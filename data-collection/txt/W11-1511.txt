Abstract

The Voynich Manuscript is an undeciphered
document from medieval Europe. We present
current knowledge about the manuscript’s text
through a series of questions about its linguis-
tic properties.

1 Introduction

The Voynich manuscript, also referred to as the
VMS, is an illustrated medieval folio written in an
undeciphered script.

There are several reasons why the study of the
manuscript is of interest to the natural language pro-
cessing community, besides its appeal as a long-
enduring unsolved mystery. Since even the ba-
sic structure of the text is unknown, it provides a
perfect opportunity for the application of unsuper-
vised learning algorithms. Furthermore, while the
manuscript has been examined by various scholars,
it has much to benefit from attention by a commu-
nity with the right tools and knowledge of linguis-
tics, text analysis, and machine learning.

This paper presents a review of what is currently
known about the VMS, as well as some original ob-
servations. Although the manuscript raises several
questions about its origin, authorship, the illustra-
tions, etc., we focus on the text through questions
about its properties. These range from the level of
the letter (for example, are there vowels and conso-
nants?) to the page (do pages have topics?) to the
document as a whole (are the pages in order?).

∗ This work was completed while the author was visiting
the Information Sciences Institute.

2 Background

2.1 History
From the illustrations – hairstyles and features of the
human figures – as well as the shapes of the glyphs,
the manuscript is posited to have been created in Eu-
rope. Carbon-dating at the University of Arizona
has found that the vellum was created in the 15th

century, and the McCrone Research Institute has as-
serted that the ink was added shortly afterwards1.

The exact history of the VMS is not established.
According to Zandbergen (2010), the earliest owner
that it can be traced to is Jacobus de Tepenec in
Prague in the early 1600s. It is speculated that it was
given to him by Emperor Rudolf II, but it is unclear
how and from where the manuscript entered Prague.

The VMS appears to have circulated in Prague for
some time, before being sent to Athanasius Kircher
in Italy in 1665. It remained in Italy until 1912,
when it was sold to Wilfrid Voynich, who brought
it to America. It was then sold to the bookdealer
Kraus, who later donated it to the Yale University
library2, where it is currently housed.

2.2 Overview
The manuscript is divided into quires – sections
made out of folded parchment, each of which con-
sists of folios, with writing on both sides of each fo-
lio (Reeds, 2002). Including blank pages and pages
with no text, there are 240 pages, although it is be-
lieved that some are missing (Pelling, 2006). 225

1These results are as yet unpublished. A paper about the
carbon-dating experiments is forthcoming in 2011.

pages include text, and most are illustrated. The text
was probably added after the illustrations, and shows
no evidence of scratching or correction.

The text is written left to right in paragraphs that
are left-aligned, justified, and divided by whitespace
into words. Paragraphs do not span multiple pages.

A few glyphs are ambiguous, since they can
be interpreted as a distinct character, or a ligature
of two or more other characters. Different tran-
scriptions of the manuscript have been created,
depending on various interpretations of the glyphs.
We use a machine-readable transcription based on
the alphabet proposed by Currier (1976), edited
by D’Imperio (1980) and others, made avail-
able by the members of the Voynich Manuscript
Mailing List (Gillogly and Reeds, 2005) at
http://www.voynich.net/reeds/gillogly/voynich.now.
The Currier transcription maps the characters to the
ASCII symbols A-Z, 0-9, and *. Under this tran-
scription, the VMS is comprised of 225 pages, 8114
word types, and 37919 word tokens. Figure 1 shows
a sample VMS page and its Currier transcription.

2.3 Manuscript sections
Based on the illustrations, the manuscript has tradi-
tionally been divided into six sections: (1) herbal,
containing drawings of plants; (2) Astronomical,
containing zodiac-like illustrations; (3) Biological,
mainly containing drawings of female human fig-
ures; (4) Cosmological, consisting of circular illus-
trations; (5) Pharmaceutical, containing drawing of
small containers and parts of plants, and (6) Stars
(sometimes referred to as Recipes), containing very
dense text with drawings of stars in the margins.

Currier (1976) observed from letter and substring
frequencies that the text is comprised of two distinct
‘languages’, A and B. Interestingly, the Biological
and Stars sections are mainly written in the B lan-
guage, and the rest mainly in A.

Using a two-state bigram HMM over the entire
text, we find that the two word classes induced by
EM more or less correspond to the same division
– words in pages classified as being in the A lan-
guage tend to be tagged as one class, and words in
B language pages as the other, indicating that the
manuscript does indeed contain two different vocab-
ularies (which may be related languages, dialects, or
simply different textual domains). In Figure 2, we

illustrate the division of the manuscript pages into
the six sections, and show the proportion of words
in each page that are classified as the B language.

For coherence, all our experimental results in the
rest of this paper are on the B language (which we
denote by VMS B) – specifically, the Biological and
Stars sections – unless otherwise specified. These
sections together contain 43 pages, with 3920 word
types, 17597 word tokens, and 35 characters. We
compare the VMS’s statistical properties with three
natural language texts of similar size: the first 28551
words from the English Wall Street Journal Corpus,
19327 words from the Arabic Quran (in Buckwalter
transcription), and 18791 words from the Chinese
Sinica Treebank.

3 The Letter

3.1 Are vowels and consonants represented?

If a script is alphabetic, i.e., it uses approximately
one character per phoneme, vowel and consonant
characters can be separated in a fully unsupervised
way. Guy (1991) applies the vowel-consonant sep-
aration algorithm of (Sukhotin, 1962) on two pages
of the Biological section, and finds that four charac-
ters (O, A, C, G) separate out as vowels. However,
the separation is not very strong, and several words
do not contain these characters.

Another method is to use a two-state bigram
HMM (Knight et al., 2006; Goldsmith and Xanthos,
2009) over letters, and induce two clusters of letters
with EM. In alphabetic languages like English, the
clusters correspond almost perfectly to vowels and
consonants. We find that a curious phenomenon oc-
curs with the VMS – the last character of every word
is generated by one of the HMM states, and all other
characters by another; i.e., the word grammar is a∗b.

There are a few possible interpretations of this. It
is possible that the vowels from every word are re-
moved and placed at the end of the word, but this
means that even long words have only one vowel,
which is unlikely. Further, the number of vowel
types would be nearly half the alphabet size. If the
script is a syllabary or a logograph, a similar clus-
tering will surface, but given that there are only 35
characters, it is unlikely that each of them represents
a syllable or word. A more likely explanation is that
the script is an abjad, like the scripts of Semitic lan-

guages, where all or most vowels are omitted. In-
deed, we find that a 2-state HMM on Arabic without
diacritics and English without vowels learns a simi-
lar grammar, a∗b+.

3.2 Do letters have cases?
Some characters (F, B, P, V) that appear mainly at
paragraphs beginnings are referred to ‘gallows’ –
glyphs that are taller and more ornate than others.
Among the glyphs, these least resemble Latin, lead-
ing to the belief that they are null symbols, which
Morningstar (2001) refutes.

Another hypothesis is that gallows are upper-
case versions of other characters. We define
BESTSUB(c) to be the character x that produces the
highest decrease in unigram word entropy when x
is substituted for all instances of c. For English up-
percase characters c, BESTSUB(c) is the lowercase
version. However, BESTSUB of the VMS gallows
is one of the other gallows! This demonstrates that
they are not uppercase versions of other letters, and
also that they are contextually similar to one another.

3.3 Is there punctuation?
We define punctuation as symbols that occur only at
word edges, whose removal from the word results in
an existing word. There are two characters that are
only found at the ends of words (Currier K and L), but
most of the words produced by removing K and L are
not in the vocabulary. Therefore, there is most likely
no punctuation, at least in the traditional sense.

4 The Word

4.1 What are the word frequency and length
distributions?

The word frequency distribution follows Zipf’s law,
which is a necessary (though not sufficient) test of
linguistic plausibility. We also find that the unigram
word entropy is comparable to the baseline texts (Ta-
ble 1).

Table 1: Unigram word entropy in bits.

VMS B English Arabic Chinese
9.666 10.07 9.645 10.31

Several works have noted the narrow binomial
distribution of word lengths, and contrasted it with

80

the wide asymmetric distribution of English, Latin,
and other European languages. This contributed to
speculation that the VMS is not a natural language,
but a code or generated by some other stochastic
process. However, Stolfi (2005) show that Pinyin
Chinese, Tibetan, and Vietnamese word lengths fol-
low a binomial distribution, and we found (Figure 3)
that certain scripts that do not contain vowels, like
Buckwalter Arabic and devoweled English, have a
binomial distribution as well.3 The similarity with
devoweled scripts, especially Arabic, reinforces the
hypothesis that the VMS script may be an abjad.

Figure 3: Word length distributions (word types).

Landini (2001) found that the VMS follows Zipf’s
law of word lengths: there is an inverse relationship
between the frequency and length of a word.

3This is an example of why comparison with a range of
languages is required before making conclusions about the
language-like nature of a text.

4.2 How predictable are letters within a word?

Bennett (1976) notes that the second-order entropy
of VMS letters is lower than most European lan-
guages. Stolfi (2005) computes the entropy of each
character given the left and right contexts and finds
that it is low for most of the VMS text, particularly
the Biological section, compared to texts in other
languages. He also ascertains that spaces between
words have extremely low entropy.

We measure the predictability of letters, and com-
pare it to English, Arabic, and Pinyin Chinese. Pre-
dictability is measured by finding the probabilities
over a training set of word types, guessing the most
likely letter (the one with the highest probability) at
each position in a word in the held-out test set, and
counting the proportion of times a guess is correct.
Table 2 shows the predictability of letters as uni-
grams, and given the preceding letter in a word (bi-
grams). VMS letters are more predictable than other
languages, with the predictability increasing sharply
given the preceding contexts, similarly to Pinyin.

Table 2: Predictability of letters, averaged over 10-fold
cross-validation runs.

VMS B English Arabic Pinyin
Bigram 40.02% 22.62% 24.78% 38.92%

Unigram 14.65% 11.09% 13.29% 11.20%

Zandbergen (2010) computes the entropies of
characters at different positions in words in the Stars
section, and finds that the 1st and 2nd characters of a
word are more predictable than in Latin or Vulgate,
but the 3rd and 4th characters are less predictable.

81



It has also been observed that word-final char-
acters have much lower entropy compared to most
other languages – some characters appear almost ex-
clusively at the ends of words.

4.3 Is there morphological structure?
The above observations suggest that words are made
up of morpheme-like chunks. Several hypotheses
about VMS word structure have been proposed. Tilt-
man (1967) proposed a template consisting of roots
and suffixes. Stolfi (2005) breaks down the morphol-
ogy into ‘prefix-midfix-suffix’, where the letters in
the midfixes are more or less disjoint from the let-
ters in the suffixes and prefixes. Stolfi later modified
this to a ‘core-mantel-crust’ model, where words are
composed of three nested layers.

To determine whether VMS words have affixal
morphology, we run an unsupervised morphologi-
cal segmentation algorithm, Linguistica (Goldsmith,
2001), on the VMS text. The MDL-based algo-
rithm segments words into prefix+stem+suffix, and
extracts ‘signatures’, sets of affixes that attach to the
same set of stems. Table 3 lists a few sample signa-
tures, showing that stems in the same signature tend
to have some structural similarities.

5 Syntax

5.1 Is there word order?
One of the most puzzling features of the VMS is its
weak word order. Notably, the text has very few re-
peated word bigrams or trigrams, which is surpris-
ing given that the unigram word entropy is com-
parable to other languages. Furthermore, there are
sequences of two or more repeated words, or rep-
etitions of very similar words. For example, the

first page of the Biological section contains the line
4OFCC89 4OFCC89 4OFC89 4OFC89 4OFCC89 E89.

We compute the predictability of a word given the
previous word (Table 4). Bigram contexts only pro-
vide marginal improvement in predictability for the
VMS, compared to the other texts. For comparison
with a language that has ‘weak word order’, we also
compute the same numbers for the first 22766 word
tokens of the Hungarian Bible, and find that the em-
pirical word order is not that weak after all.

Table 4: Predictability of words (over 10-fold cross-
validation) with bigram contexts, compared to unigrams.

Unigram Bigram Improvement
VMS B 2.30% 2.50% 8.85%
English 4.72% 11.9% 151%
Arabic 3.81% 14.2% 252%

Chinese 16.5% 19.8% 19.7%
Hungarian 5.84% 13.0% 123%

5.2 Are there latent word classes?
While there are very few repeated word bigrams,
perhaps there are latent classes of words that gov-
ern word order. We induce ten word classes using a
bigram HMM trained with EM (Figure 4). As with
the stems in the morphological signatures, the words
in each class show some regularities – although it
is hard to quantify the similarities – suggesting that
these latent classes are meaningful.

Currier (1976) found that some word-initial char-
acters are affected by the word-final characters of
the immediately preceding word. He concludes that
the ‘words’ being syllables or digits would explain
this phenomenon, although that is unlikely given the
rarity of repeated sequences.

We redo the predictability experiments of the pre-
vious section, using the last m letters of the previous
word to predict the first n letters of the current word.
When n > 2, improvement in predictability remains
low. However, when n is 1 or 2, there is a noticeable
improvement when using the last few characters of
the previous word as contexts (Table 5).

5.3 Are there long-distance word correlations?
Weak bigram word order can arise if the text is
scrambled or is generated by a unigram process. Al-
ternately, the text might have been created by inter-

82

leaving the words of two or more texts, in which case
there will be long-distance correlations.

Schinner (2007) shows that the probability of sim-
ilar words repeating in the text at a given distance
from each other follows a geometric distribution.

Figure 5 illustrates the ‘collocationness’ at dis-
tance d, measured as the average pointwise mutual
information over all pairs of words w1, w2 that occur
more than once at distance d apart. VMS words do
not show significant long-distance correlations.

6 The Page

6.1 Do pages have topics?
That is, do certain words ‘burst’ with a high fre-
quency within a page, or are words randomly dis-
tributed across the manuscript? Figure 6 shows a vi-
sualization of the TF-IDF values of words in a VMS
B page, where the ‘documents’ are pages, indicating
the relevance of each word to the page. Also shown
is the same page in a version of the document created
by scrambling the words of the original manuscript,
and repaginating to the same page lengths. This sim-
ulates a document where words are generated inde-
pendent of the page, i.e., the pages have no topics.

Figure 5: Long-range collocationness. Arabic shows
stronger levels of long-distance correlation compared to
English and Chinese. VMS B shows almost no correla-
tions for distance d > 1.

To quantify the degree to which a page contains
topics, we measure the entropy of words within the
page, and denote the overall ‘topicality’ T of a doc-
ument as the average entropy over all the pages. As
a control, we compute the topicality Trand of the
scrambled version of the document. 1 − T/Trand
indicates the extent to which the pages of the docu-
ment contain topics. Table 6 shows that by this mea-
sure, the VMS’s strength of page topics is less than
the English texts, but more than the Quran4, signify-
ing that the pages probably do have topics, but are
not independent of one another.

6.2 Is the text prose?

Visually, the text looks like prose written in para-
graphs. However, Currier (1976) stated that “the line

4We demarcate a ‘page’ to be approximately 25 verses for
the Quran, a chapter for the Genesis, and an article for the WSJ.

is a functional entity” – that is, there are patterns to
lines on the page that are uncharacteristic of prose.
In particular, certain characters or sequences appear
almost exclusively at the beginnings or ends of lines.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of characters at
line-edges, relative to their occurrences at word
beginnings or endings,confirming Currier’s obser-
vation. It is particularly interesting that lower-
frequency characters occur more at line-ends, and
higher-frequency ones at the beginnings of lines.

Schinner (2007) found that characters show long-
range correlations at distances over 72 characters,
which is a little over the average line length.

7 The Document

7.1 Are the pages in order?

We measure the similarity between two pages as the
cosine similarity over bags of words, and count the
proportion of pages Pi where the page Pi−1 or Pi+1
is the most similar page to Pi. We denote this mea-
sure by ADJPAGESIM. If ADJPAGESIM is high, it
indicates that (1) the pages are not independent of
each other and (2) the pages are in order.

Table 7 shows ADJPAGESIM for the VMS and
other texts. As expected, ADJPAGESIM is close to
zero for the VMS with pages scrambled, as well as
the WSJ, where each page is an independent article,

and is highest for the VMS, particularly the B pages.

Table 7: ADJPAGESIM for VMS and other texts.
VMS B 38.8%
VMS All 15.6%
VMS B pages scrambled 0%
VMS All pages scrambled 0.444%
WSJ 1.34%
English Genesis 25.0%
Arabic Quran 27.5%

This is a convincing argument for the pages be-
ing mostly in order. However, the non-contiguity
of the herbal and pharmaceutical sections and the
interleaving of the A and B languages indicates
that larger chunks of pages were probably re-
ordered. In addition, details involving illustrations
and ink-transfer across pages point to a few local re-
orderings (Pelling, 2006).

7.2 How many authors were involved?

Currier (1976) observed that the distinction between
the A and B languages corresponds to two different
types of handwriting, implying at least two authors.
He claimed that based on finer handwriting analysis,
there may have been as many as eight scribes.

8 Latin, Cipher, or Hoax?

Claims of decipherment of the VMS script have
been surfacing for several years, none of which are
convincing. Newbold (1928) believed that micro-
scopic irregularities of glyph edges correspond to
anagrammed Latin. Feely in 1943 proposed that the
script is a code for abbreviated Latin (D’Imperio,
1980). Sherwood (2008) believes that the words
are coded anagrams of Italian. Others have hypoth-

84

esized that the script is an encoding of Ukrainian
(Stojko, 1978), English (Strong, 1945; Brumbaugh,
1976), or a Flemish Creole (Levitov, 1987). The
word length distribution and other properties have
invoked decodings into East Asian languages like
Manchu (Banasik, 2004). These theories tend to rely
on arbitrary anagramming and substitutions, and are
not falsifiable or well-defined.

The mysterious properties of the text and its resis-
tance to decoding have led some to conclude that it
is a hoax – a nonsensical string made to look vaguely
language-like. Rugg (2004) claims that words might
have been generated using a ‘Cardan Grille’ – a
way to deterministically generate words from a ta-
ble of morphemes. However, it seems that the Grille
emulates a restricted finite state grammar of words
over prefixes, midfixes, and suffixes. Such a gram-
mar underlies many affixal languages, including En-
glish. Martin (2008) proposes a method of generat-
ing VMS text from anagrams of number sequences.
Like the previous paper, it only shows that this
method can create VMS-like words – not that it is
the most plausible way of generating the manuscript.
It is also likely that the proposed scheme can be used
to generate any natural language text.

Schinner (2007) votes for the hoax hypothesis
based on his observations about characters showing
long-range correlations, and the geometric distribu-
tion of the probability of similar words repeating at
a fixed distance. These observations only confirm

that the VMS has some properties unlike natural lan-
guage, but not that it is necessarily a hoax.

9 Conclusion

We have detailed various known properties of the
Voynich manuscript text. Some features – the lack
of repeated bigrams and the distributions of letters at
line-edges – are linguistically aberrant, which others
– the word length and frequency distributions, the
apparent presence of morphology, and most notably,
the presence of page-level topics – conform to natu-
ral language-like text.

It is our hope that this paper will motivate re-
search into understanding the manuscript by schol-
ars in computational linguistics. The questions pre-
sented here are obviously not exhaustive; a deeper
examination of the statistical features of the text in
comparison to a number of scripts and languages is
needed before any definite conclusions can be made.
Such studies may also inspire a quantitative interest
in linguistic and textual typologies, and be applica-
ble to the decipherment of other historical scripts.
