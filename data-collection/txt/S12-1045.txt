Abstract

Automatic detection of negation cues along
with their scope and corresponding negated
events is an important task that could bene-
fit other natural language processing (NLP)
tasks such as extraction of factual information
from text, sentiment analysis, etc. This paper
presents a system for this task that exploits
phrasal and contextual clues apart from vari-
ous token specific features. The system was
developed for the participation in the Task 1
(closed track) of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task
(Resolving the Scope and Focus of Negation),
where it is ranked 3rd among the participating
teams while attaining the highest F1 score for
negation cue detection.

1 Introduction

Negation is a linguistic phenomenon that can al-
ter the meaning of a textual segment. While auto-
matic detection of negation expressions (i.e. cues)
in free text has been a subject of research interest
for quite some time (e.g. Chapman et al. (2001),
Elkin et al. (2005) etc), automatic detection of full
scope of negation is a relatively new topic (Morante
and Daelemans, 2009; Councill et al., 2010). Detec-
tion of negation cues, their scope and corresponding
negated events in free text could improve accuracy in
other natural language processing (NLP) tasks such
as extraction of factual information from text, senti-
ment analysis, etc (Jia et al., 2009; Councill et al.,
2010).

In this paper, we present a system that was de-
veloped for the participation in the Scope Detection

task of the *SEM 2012 Shared Task1. The proposed
system exploits phrasal and contextual clues apart
from various token specific features. Exploitation
of phrasal clues is not new for negation scope de-
tection. But the way we encode this information
(i.e. the features for phrasal clues) is novel and dif-
fers completely from the previous work (Councill et
al., 2010; Morante and Daelemans, 2009). More-
over, the total number of features that we use is also
comparatively lower. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, automatic negated event/property iden-
tification has not been explored prior to the *SEM
2012 Shared Task. So, our proposed approach for
this particular sub-task is another contribution of this
paper.

The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows. First, we describe the scope detection task
as well as the accompanying datasets in Section 2.
Then in Section 3, we present how we approach the
task. Following that, in Section 4, various empiri-
cal results and corresponding analyses are discussed.
Finally, we summarize our work and discuss how the
system can be further improved in Section 5.

2 Task Description: Scope Detection

The Scope Detection task (Task 1) of *SEM 2012
Shared Task deals with intra-sentential (i.e. con-
text is single sentence) negations. According to
the guidelines of the task (Morante and Daelemans,
2012; Morante et al., 2011), the scope of a nega-
tion cue(s) is composed of all negated concepts and
negated event/property, if any. Negation cue(s) is

not considered as part of the scope. Cues and scopes
may be discontinuous.

The organisers provided three sets of data – train-
ing, development and test datasets, all consisting of
stories by Conan Doyle. The training dataset con-
tains Chapters 1-14 from The Hound of the
Baskervilles. While development dataset
contains The Adventures of Wisteria
Lodge. For testing, two other stories, The
Adventure of the Red Circle and The
Adventure of the Cardboard Box, were
released during the evaluation period of the shared
task. Table 1 shows various statistics regarding the
datasets.

In the training and development data, all occur-
rences of negation are annotated. For each negation
cue, the cue and corresponding scope are marked,
as well as the negated event/property, if any. The
data is provided in CoNLL-2005 Shared Task for-
mat. Table 2 shows an example of annotated data
where “un” is the negation cue, “his own conven-
tional appearance” is the scope, and “conventional”
is the negated property.

The test data has a format similar to the training
data except that only the Columns 1–7 (as shown in
Table 2) are provided. Participating systems have to
output the remaining column(s).

During a random checking we have found at least
2 missing annotations2 in the development data. So,
there might be few wrong/missing annotations in the
other datasets, too.

There were two tracks in the task. For the closed
2Annotations for the following negation cues (and their cor-

responding scope/negated events) in the development data are
missing – {cue: “no”, token no.: 8, sentence no.: 237, chap-
ter: wisteria01} and {cue: “never”, token no.: 3, sentence no.:
358, chapter: wisteria02}.

track, systems have to be built strictly with infor-
mation contained in the given training corpus. This
includes the automatic annotations that the organiz-
ers provide for different levels of analysis (POS tags,
lemmas and parse trees). For the open track, sys-
tems can be developed making use of any kind of
external tools and resources.

We participated in the closed track of the scope
detection task.

3 Our Approach

We approach the subtasks (i.e. cue, scope and
negated event detection) of the Task 1 as sequence
identification problems and train three different 1st
order Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifiers
(i.e. one for each of them) using the MALLET ma-
chine learning toolkit (McCallum, 2002). All these
classifiers use ONLY the information available in-
side the training corpus (i.e. training and develop-
ment datasets) as provided by the task organisers,
which is the requirement of the closed track.

3.1 Negation Cue Detection

At first, our system automatically collects a vocab-
ulary of all the positive tokens (i.e. those which are
not negation cues) of length greater than 3 charac-
ters, after excluding negation cue affixes (if any),
from the training data and uses them to extract fea-
tures that could be useful to identify potential nega-
tion cues which are subtokens (e.g. *un*able). We
also create a list of highly probable negation ex-
pressions (henceforth, NegExpList) from the train-
ing data based on frequencies. The list consists of
the following terms – nor, neither, without, nobody,
none, nothing, never, not, no, nowhere, and non.

Negation cue subtokens are identified if the token
itself is predicted as a negation cue by the classi-
fier and has one of the following affixes that are col-
lected from the training data – less, un, dis, im, in,
non, ir.

Lemmas are converted to lower case inside the
feature set. Additional post-processing is done to
annotate some obvious negation expressions that are
seen inside the training data but sometimes missed
by the classifier during prediction on the develop-
ment data. These expressions include neither, no-
body, save for, save upon, and by no means. A spe-

cial check is done for the phrase “none the less”
which is marked as a non-negation expression inside
the training data.

Finally, a CRF model is trained using the col-
lected features (see Table 3) and used to predict
negation cue on test instance.

3.2 Scope and Negated Event Detection

Once the negation cues are identified, the next tasks
are to detect scopes of the cues and negated events
which are approached independently using separate
classifiers. If a sentence has multiple negation cues,
we create separate training/test instance of the sen-
tence for each of the cues.

Tables 4 and 5 show the feature sets that are used
to train classifiers. Both the feature sets exclusively
use various phrasal clues, e.g. whether the (clos-

est) NP, VP, S or SBAR containing the token un-
der consideration (i.e. tokeni) and that of the nega-
tion cue are different. Further phrasal clues that are
exploited include whether the least common phrase
of tokeni has no other phrase as child, and also
list of the counts of different common phrasal cat-
egories (starting from the root of the parse tree) that
contain tokeni and the cue. These latter two types
of phrasal clue features are found effective for the
negated event detection but not for scope detection.

We also use various token specific features (e.g.
lemma, POS, etc) and contextual features (e.g.
lemma of the 1st word of the corresponding sen-
tence, position of the token with respect to the cue,
presence of conjunction and special characters be-
tween tokeni and the cue, etc). Finally, new fea-
tures are created by combining different features of
the neighbouring tokens within a certain range of the
tokeni. The range values are selected empirically.

Once scopes and negated events are identified
(separately), the prediction output of all the three
classifiers are merged to produce the full negation
scope.

Initially, a number of features is chosen by doing
manual inspection (randomly) of the scopes/negated
events in the training data as well analysing syntac-
tic structures of the corresponding sentences. Some
of those features (e.g. POS of previous token for
scope detection) which are found (empirically) as
not useful for performance improvement have been
discarded.

We left behind two verifications unintentionally
which should have been included. One of them is
to take into account whether a sentence is a fac-
tual statement or a question before negated event de-
tection. The other is to check whether a predicted
negated event is found inside the predicted scope of
the corresponding negation cue.

4 Results and Discussions

In this section, we discuss various empirical re-
sults on the development data and test data. De-
tails regarding the evaluation criteria are described
in Morante and Blanco (2012).

4.1 Results on the Development Dataset

experiments by combining various potential feature

on the training data and tested on development data.

Due to time limitation we could not do parameter
tuning for CRF model training which we assume
could further improve the results.

Table 8 shows the results3 on the development
data using the feature sets described in Section 3.
There are two noticeable things in these results.
Firstly, there is a very high F1 score (93.29%) ob-
tained for negation cue identification. And secondly,
the precision obtained for scope detection (97.92%)
is very high as well.

tification) obtained before and after the usage of our
proposed 5 phrasal clue feature types (using gold an-
notation of negation cues). As we can see, there is a
significant improvement in recall (almost 10 points)
due to the usage of phrasal clues which ultimately
leads to a considerable increase (almost 6.5 points)
of F1 score.

4.2 Results on the Official Test Dataset

Table 9 shows official results of our system in the
*SEM 2012 Shared Task (closed track) of scope de-
tection, as provided by the organisers. It should be
noted that the test dataset is almost 1.5 times bigger
than the combined training corpus (i.e. training +
development data). Despite this fact, the results of
cue and scope detection on the test data are almost
similar as those on the development data. How-
ever, there is a sharp drop (almost 4 points lower F1
score) in negated event identification, primarily due
to lower precision. This resulted in a lower F1 score
(almost 4.5 points) for full negation identification.

4.3 Further Analyses of the Results and
Feature Sets

Our analyses of the empirical results (conducted
on the development data) suggest that negation cue
identification largely depends on the token itself
rather than its surrounding syntactic construction.
Although context (i.e. immediate neighbouring to-
kens) are also important, the significance of a vo-
cabulary of positive tokens (for the identification of
negation cue subtokens) and the list of negation cue
expressions is quite obvious. In a recently published
study, Morante (2010) listed a number of negation
cues and argued that their total number are actually
not exhaustive. We refrained from using the cues
listed in that paper (instead we built a list automati-
cally from the training data) since additional knowl-
edge/resource outside the training data was not al-
lowed for the closed track. But we speculate that
usage of such list of expressions as well as an exter-
nal dictionary of (positive) words can further boost
the high performance that we already achieved.

Since scope and negation event detection are de-
pendent on the correct identification of cues, we
have done separate evaluation on the development
data using the gold cues (instead of predicting the
cues first). As the results in Table 7 show, there is a
considerable increment in the results for both scope
and event detection if the correct annotation of cues
are available.

The general trend of errors that we have observed
in scope detection is that the more distant a token is
from the negation cue in the phrase structure tree (of
the corresponding sentence) the harder it becomes
for the classifier to predict whether the token should
be included in the scope or not. For example, in the
sentence “I am not aware that in my whole life such
a thing has ever happened before.” of the devel-
opment data, the negation cue “not” has scope over
the whole sentence. But the scope classifier fails to
include the last 4 words in the scope. Perhaps syn-
tactic dependency can provide complementary infor-
mation in such cases.

As for the negated event identification errors, the
majority of the prediction errors (on the develop-
ment data) occurred for verb and noun tokens which
are mostly immediately preceded by the negation
cue. Information of syntactic dependency should be

helpful to reduce such errors, too.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented our approach for nega-
tion cue, scope and negated event detection task
(closed track) of *SEM 2012 Shared Task, where
our system ranked 3rd among the participating
teams for full negation detection while obtaining the
best F1 score for negation cue detection. Interest-
ingly, according to the results provided by the organ-
isers, our system performs better than all the systems
of the open track except one (details of these results
are described in (Morante and Blanco, 2012)).

The features exploited by our system include
phrasal and contextual clues as well as token spe-
cific information. Empirical results show that the
system achieves very high precision for scope de-
tection. The results also imply that the novel phrasal
clue features exploited by our system improve iden-
tification of negated events significantly.

We believe the system can be further improved
in a number of ways. Firstly, this can be done by
incorporating linguistic knowledge as described in
Morante (2010). Secondly, we did not take into ac-
count whether a sentence is a factual statement or
a question before negated event detection. We also
did not check whether a predicted negated event is
found inside the predicted scope of the correspond-
ing negation cue. These verifications should in-

crease the results more. Finally, previous work re-
ported that usage of syntactic dependency informa-
tion helps in scope detection (Councill et al., 2010).
Hence, this could be another possible direction for
improvement.
