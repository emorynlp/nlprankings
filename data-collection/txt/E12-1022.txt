Abstract

Update summarization is a new challenge
in multi-document summarization focusing
on summarizing a set of recent documents
relatively to another set of earlier docu-
ments. We present an unsupervised proba-
bilistic approach to model novelty in a doc-
ument collection and apply it to the genera-
tion of update summaries. The new model,
called DUALSUM, results in the second or
third position in terms of the ROUGE met-
rics when tuned for previous TAC competi-
tions and tested on TAC-2011, being statis-
tically indistinguishable from the winning
system. A manual evaluation of the gen-
erated summaries shows state-of-the art re-
sults for DUALSUM with respect to focus,
coherence and overall responsiveness.

1 Introduction

Update summarization is the problem of extract-
ing and synthesizing novel information in a col-
lection of documents with respect to a set of doc-
uments assumed to be known by the reader. This
problem has received much attention in recent
years, as can be observed in the number of partic-
ipants to the special track on update summariza-
tion organized by DUC and TAC since 2007. The
problem is usually formalized as follows: Given
two collections A and B, where the documents in
A chronologically precede the documents in B,
generate a summary of B under the assumption
that the user of the summary has already read the
documents in A.

Extractive techniques are the most common
approaches in multi-document summarization.
Summaries generated by such techniques consist

of sentences extracted from the document collec-
tion. Extracts can have coherence and cohesion
problems, but they generally offer a good trade-
off between linguistic quality and informative-
ness.

While numerous extractive summarization
techniques have been proposed for multi-
document summarization (Erkan and Radev,
2004; Radev et al., 2004; Shen and Li, 2010; Li et
al., 2011), few techniques have been specifically
designed for update summarization. Most exist-
ing approaches handle it as a redundancy removal
problem, with the goal of producing a summary of
collection B that is as dissimilar as possible from
either collection A or from a summary of collec-
tionA. A problem with this approach is that it can
easily classify as redundant sentences in which
novel information is mixed with existing informa-
tion (from collection A). Furthermore, while this
approach can identify sentences that contain novel
information, it cannot model explicitly what the
novel information is.

Recently, Bayesian models have successfully
been applied to multi-document summarization
showing state-of-the-art results in summarization
competitions (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009;
Jin et al., 2010). These approaches offer clear and
rigorous probabilistic interpretations that many
other techniques lack. Furthermore, they have the
advantage of operating in unsupervised settings,
which can be used in real-world scenarios, across
domains and languages. To our best knowledge,
previous work has not used this approach for up-
date summarization.

In this article, we propose a novel nonpara-
metric Bayesian approach for update summariza-
tion. Our approach, which is a variation of Latent

214



Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003),
aims to learn to distinguish between common in-
formation and novel information. We have eval-
uated this approach on the ROUGE scores and
demonstrate that it produces comparable results
to the top system in TAC-2011. Furthermore, our
approach improves over that system when evalu-
ated manually in terms of linguistic quality and
overall responsiveness.

2.1 Bayesian approaches in Summarization

Most Bayesian approaches to summarization are
based on topic models. These generative mod-
els represent documents as mixtures of latent top-
ics, where a topic is a probability distribution over
words. In TOPICSUM (Haghighi and Vander-
wende, 2009), each word is generated by a sin-
gle topic which can be a corpus-wide background
distribution over common words, a distribution
of document-specific words or a distribution of
the core content of a given cluster. BAYESSUM
(Daumé and Marcu, 2006) and the Special Words
and Background model (Chemudugunta et al.,
2006) are very similar to TOPICSUM.

A commonality of all these models is the use of
collection and document-specific distributions in
order to distinguish between the general and spe-
cific topics in documents. In the context of sum-
marization, this distinction helps to identify the
important pieces of information in a collection.

Models that use more structure in the repre-
sentation of documents have also been proposed
for generating more coherent and less redun-
dant summaries, such as HIERSUM (Haghighi
and Vanderwende, 2009) and TTM (Celikyilmaz
and Hakkani-Tur, 2011). For instance, HIERSUM
models the intuitions that first sentences in docu-
ments should contain more general information,
and that adjacent sentences are likely to share
specic content vocabulary. However, HIERSUM,
which builds upon TOPICSUM, does not show
a statistically signicant improvement in ROUGE
over TOPICSUM.

A number of techniques have been proposed to
rank sentences of a collection given a word distri-
bution (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Goldstein
et al., 1999). The Kullback-Leibler divergence
(KL) is a widely used measure in summarization.
Given a target distribution T that we want a sum-

mary S to approximate, KL is commonly used as
the scoring function to select the subset of sen-
tences S∗ that minimizes the KL divergence with
T :

S∗ = argmin
S

KL(T, S) =
∑
w∈V

pT (w) log
pT (w)

pS(w)

where w is a word from the vocabulary V. This
strategy is called KLSum. Usually, a smoothing
factor τ is applied on the candidate distribution S
in order to avoid the divergence to be undefined1.

This objective function selects the most repre-
sentative sentences of the collection, and at the
same time it also diversifies the generated sum-
mary by penalizing redundancy. Since the prob-
lem of finding the subset of sentences from a
collection that minimizes the KL divergence is
NP-complete, a greedy algorithm is often used in
practice2. Some variations of this objective func-
tion can be considered, such as penalizing sen-
tences that contain document-specific topics (Ma-
son and Charniak, 2011) or rewarding sentences
appearing closer to the beginning of the docu-
ment.

Wang et al. (2009) propose a Bayesian ap-
proach for summarization that does not use KL
for reranking. In their model, Bayesian Sentence-
based Topic Models, every sentence in a docu-
ment is assumed to be associated to a unique la-
tent topic. Once the model parameters have been
calculated, a summary is generated by choosing
the sentence with the highest probability for each
topic.

While hierarchical topic modeling approaches
have shown remarkable effectiveness in learning
the latent topics of document collections, they are
not designed to capture the novel information in
a collection with respect to another one, which is
the primary focus of update summarization.

2.2 Update Summarization

The goal of update summarization is to generate
an update summary of a collection B of recent
documents assuming that the users already read
earlier documents from a collection A. We refer

1In our experiments we set τ = 0.01.
2In our experiments, we follow the same approach as in

(Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) by greedily adding sen-
tences to a summary so long as they decrease KL divergence.

to collection A as the base collection and to col-
lection B as the update collection.

Update summarization is related to novelty de-
tection which can be defined as the problem of
determining whether a document contains new in-
formation given an existing collection (Soboroff
and Harman, 2005). Thus, while the goal of nov-
elty detection is to determine whether some infor-
mation is new, the goal of update summarization
is to extract and synthesize the novel information.

Update summarization is also related to con-
trastive summarization, i.e. the problem of jointly
generating summaries for two entities in order to
highlight their differences (Lerman and McDon-
ald, 2009). The primary difference here is that
update summarization aims to extract novel or up-
dated information in the update collection with re-
spect to the base collection.

The most common approach for update sum-
marization is to apply a normal multi-document
summarizer, with some added functionality to re-
move sentences that are redundant with respect
to collection A. This can be achieved using sim-
ple filtering rules (Fisher and Roark, 2008), Max-
imal Marginal Relevance (Boudin et al., 2008), or
more complex graph-based algorithms (Shen and
Li, 2010; Wenjie et al., 2008). The goal here is
to boost sentences in B that bring out completely
novel information. One problem with this ap-
proach is that it is likely to discard as redundant
sentences in B containing novel information if it
is mixed with known information from collection
A.

Another approach is to introduce specific fea-
tures intended to capture the novelty in collection
B. For example, comparing collections A and B,
FastSum derives features for the collection B such
as number of named entities in the sentence that
already occurred in the old cluster or the number
of new content words in the sentence not already
mentioned in the old cluster that are subsequently
used to train a Support Vector Machine classifier
(Schilder et al., 2008). A limitation with this ap-
proach is there are no large training sets available
and, the more features it has, the more it is af-
fected by the sparsity of the training data.

3 DualSum

3.1 Model Formulation

The input for DUALSUM is a set of pairs of collec-
tions of documents C = {(Ai,Bi)}i=1...m, where
Ai is a base document collection and Bi is an up-
date document collection. We use c to refer to a
collection pair (Ac,Bc).

In DUALSUM, documents are modeled as a bag
of words that are assumed to be sampled from a
mixture of latent topics. Each word is associated
with a latent variable that specifies which topic
distribution is used to generate it. Words in a doc-
ument are assumed to be conditionally indepen-
dent given the hidden topic.

As in previous Bayesian works for summariza-
tion (Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Chemudugunta
et al., 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009),
DUALSUM not only learns collection-specific dis-
tributions, but also a general background distri-
bution over common words, φG and a document-
specific distribution φcd for each document d in
collection pair c, which is useful to separate the
specific aspects from the general aspects of c. The
main novelty is that DUALSUM introduces spe-
cific machinery for identifying novelty.

To capture the differences between the base and
the update collection for each pair c, DUALSUM
learns two topics for every collection pair. The
joint topic, φAc captures the common information
between the two collections in the pair, i.e. the
main event that both collections are discussing.
The update topic, φBc focuses on the specific as-
pects that are specific of the documents inside the
update collection.

In the generative model,

• For a document d in a collection Ac, words
can be originated from one of three differ-
ent topics: φG, φcd and φAc , the last one of
which captures the main topic described in
the collection pair.

• For a document d in a collection Bc, words
can be originated from one of four different
topics: φG, φcd, φAc and φBc . The last one
will capture the most important updates to
the main topic.

To make this representation easier, we can also
state that both collections are generated from the
four topics, but we constrain the topic probability

for φBc to be always zero when generating a base
document.

We denote ucd ∈ {A,B} the type of a docu-
ment d in pair c. This is an observed, Boolean
variable stating whether the document d belongs
to the base or the update collection inside the pair
c.

The generation process of documents in DU-
ALSUM is described in Figure 1, and the plate
diagram corresponding to this generative story
is shown in Figure 2. DUALSUM is an LDA-
like model, where topic distributions are multi-
nomial distributions over words and topics that
are sampled from Dirichlet distributions. We use
λ = (λG, λD, λA, λB) as symmetric priors for the
Dirichlet distributions generating the word distri-
butions. In our experiments, we set λG = 0.1 and
λD = λA = λB = 0.001. A greater value is as-
signed to λG in order to reflect the intuition that

there should be more words in the background
than in the other distributions, so the mass is ex-
pected to be shared on a larger number of words.

Unlike for the word distributions, mixing prob-
abilities are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution
with asymmetric priors. The prior knowledge
about the origin of words in the base and up-
date collections is again encoded at the level the
hyper-parameters. For example, if we set γA =
(5, 3, 2, 0), this would reflect the intuition that,
on average, in the base collections, 50% of the
words originate from the background distribution,
30% from the document-specific distribution, and
20% from the joint topic. Similarly, if we set
γB = (5, 2, 2, 1), the prior reflects the assumption
that, on average, in the update collections, 50% of
the words originate from the background distri-
bution, 20% from the document-specific distribu-
tion, 20% from the joint topic, and 10% from the
novel, update topic3. The priors we have actually
used are reported in Section 4.

3.2 Learning and inference
In order to find the optimal model parameters, the
following equation needs to be computed:

p(z, ψ, φ|w,u) = p(z, ψ, φ,w,u)
p(w,u)

Omitting hyper-parameters for notational sim-
plicity, the joint distribution over the observed
variables is:

p(w,u) = p(φG)×∏

p(φAc)p(φBc)×

∫
∆

p(ψcd|ucd)dψcd ×∏

∑
cdn

p(wcdn|zcdn)p(zcdn|ψcd)

where ∆ denotes the 4-dimensional simplex4.
Since this equation is intractable, we need to per-
form approximate inference in order to estimate
the model parameters. A number of Bayesian sta-
tistical inference techniques can be used to ad-
dress this problem.

3To highlight the difference between asymmetric and
symmetric priors we put the indices in superscript and sub-
script respectively.

4Remember that, for base documents, words cannot
be generated by the update topic, so ∆ denotes the 3-
dimensional simplex for base documents.

Variational approaches (Blei et al., 2003) and
collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers,
2004) are common techniques for approximate in-
ference in Bayesian models. They offer different
advantages: the variational approach is arguably
faster computationally, but the Gibbs sampling
approach is in principal more accurate since it
asymptotically approaches the correct distribution
(Porteous et al., 2008). In this section, we pro-
vide details on a collapsed Gibbs sampling strat-
egy to infer the model parameters of DUALSUM
for a given dataset.

Collapsed Gibbs sampling is a particular case
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that in-
volves repeatedly sampling a topic assignment for
each word in the corpus. A single iteration of the
Gibbs sampler is completed after sampling a new
topic for each word based on the previous assign-
ment. In a collapsed Gibbs sampler, the model
parameters are integrated out (or collapsed), al-
lowing to only sample z. Let us call wcdn the n-th
word in document d in collection c, and zcdn its
topic assignment. For Gibbs sampling, we need
to calculate p(zcdn|w,u, z−cdn) where z−cdn de-
notes the random vector of topic assignments ex-
cept the assignment zcdn.

where k ∈ K, n(v)k denotes the number of times
word v is assigned to topic k, and n(cd)k denotes
the number of words in document d of collection
c that are assigned to topic k.

By the strong law of large numbers, the average
of sample parameters should converge towards
the true expected value of the model parameter.
Therefore, good estimates of the model parame-
ters can be obtained averaging over the sampled
values. As suggested by Gamerman and Lopes
(2006), we have set a lag (20 iterations) between
samples in order to reduce auto-correlation be-
tween samples. Our sampler also discards the first
100 iterations as burn-in period in order to avoid
averaging from samples that are still strongly in-
fluenced by the initial assignment.

4 Experiments in Update
Summarization

The Bayesian graphical model described in the
previous section can be run over a set of news
collections to learn the background distribution,
a joint distribution for each collection, an update
distribution for each collection and the document-
specific distributions. Once this is done, one of
the learned collections can be used to generate the
summary that best approximates this collection,
using the greedy algorithm described by Haghighi
and Vanderwende (2009). Still, there are some pa-
rameters that can be defined and which affects the
results obtained:

• DUALSUM’s choice of hyper-parameters af-
fects how the topics are learned.

• The documents can be represented with n-
grams of different lengths.

• It is possible to generate a summary that ap-
proximates the joint distribution, the update-
only distribution, or a combination of both.

This section describes how these parameters
have been tuned.

4.1 Parameter tuning
We use the TAC 2008 and 2009 update task
datasets as training set for tuning the hyper-
parameters for the model, namely the pseudo-
counts for the two Dirichlet priors that affects the
topic mix assignment for each document. By per-
forming a grid search over a large set of pos-
sible hyper-parameters, these have been fixed to

218



γA = (90, 190, 50, 0) and γB = (90, 170, 45, 25)
as the values that produced the best ROUGE-2
score on those two datasets.

Regarding the base collection, this can be inter-
preted as setting as prior knowledge that roughly
27% of the words in the original dataset originate
from the background distribution, 58% from the
document-specific distributions, and 15% from
the topic of the original collection. We remind
the reader that the last value in γA is set to zero
because, due to the problem definition, the origi-
nal collection must have no words generated from
the update topic, which reflects the most recent
developments that are still not present in the base
collections A.

Regarding the update set, 27% of the words are
assumed to originate again from the background
distribution, 51% from the document-specific dis-
tributions, 14% from an topic in common with
the original collection, and 8% from the update-
specific topic. One interesting fact to note from
these settings is that most of the words belong to
topics that are specific to single documents (58%
and 51% respectively for both sets A and B) and
to the background distribution, whereas the joint
and update topics generate a much smaller, lim-
ited set of words. This helps these two distribu-
tions to be more focused.

The other settings mentioned at the beginning
of this section have been tuned using the TAC-
2010 dataset, which we reserved as our develop-
ment set. Once the different document-specific
and collection-specific distributions have been ob-
tained, we have to choose the target distribu-
tion T to with which the possible summaries will
be compared using the KL metric. Usually, the
human-generated update summaries not only in-
clude the terms that are very specific about the last
developments, but they also include a little back-
ground regarding the developing event. There-
fore, we try, for KLSum, a simple mixture be-
tween the joint topic (φA) and the update topic
(φB).

Figure 3 shows the ROUGE-2 results obtained
as we vary the mixture weight between the joint
φA distribution and the update-specific φB distri-
bution. As can be seen at the left of the curve, us-
ing only the update-specific model, which disre-
gards the generic words about the topic described,
produces much lower results. The results improve
as the relative weight of the joined topic model

Figure 3: Variation in ROUGE-2 score in the TAC-
2010 dataset as we change the mixture weight for the
joined topic model between 0 and 1.

scores (TAC-2010 dataset). Results are reported us-
ing bigrams (above, blue), unigrams (middle, red) and
trigrams (below, yellow).

increases until it plateaus at a maximum around
roughly the interval [0.6, 0.8], and from that point
performance slowly degrades as at the right part
of the curve the update model is given very little
importance in generating the summary. Based on
these results, from this point onwards, the mixture
weight has been set to 0.7. Note that using only
the joint distribution (setting the mixture weight
to 1.0) also produces reasonable results, hinting
that it successfully incorporates the most impor-
tant n-grams from across the base and the update
collections at the same time.

A second parameter is the size of the n-grams
for representing the documents. The original
implementations of SUMBASIC (Nenkova and
Vanderwende, 2005) and TOPICSUM (Haghighi
and Vanderwende, 2009) were defined over sin-

219



gle words (unigrams). Still, Haghighi and Van-
derwende (2009) report some improvements in
the ROUGE-2 score when representing words as
a bag of bigrams, and Darling (2010) mention
similar improvements when running SUMBASIC
with bigrams. Figure 4 shows the effect on the
ROUGE-2 curve when we switch to using uni-
grams and trigrams. As stated in previous work,
using bigrams has better results than using uni-
grams. Using trigrams was worse than either of
them. This is probably because trigrams are too
specific and the document collections are small,
so the models are more likely to suffer from data
sparseness.

4.2 Baselines
DUALSUM is a modification of TOPICSUM de-
signed specifically for the case of update sum-
marization, by modifying TOPICSUM’s graphical
model in a way that captures the dependency be-
tween the joint and the update collections. Still, it
is important to discover whether the new graphi-
cal model actually improves over simpler applica-
tions of TOPICSUM to this task. The three base-
lines that we have considered are:

• Running TOPICSUM on the set of collections
containing only the update documents. We
call this run TOPICSUMB.

• Running TOPICSUM on the set of collections
containing both the base and the update doc-
uments. Contrary to the previous run, the
topic model for each collection in this run
will contain information relevant to the base
events. We call this run TOPICSUMA∪B.

• Running TOPICSUM twice, once on the set
of collections containing the update docu-
ments, and the second time on the set of
collections containing the base documents.
Then, for each collection, the obtained base
and update models are combined in a mix-
ture model using a mixture weight between
zero and one. The weight has been tuned us-
ing TAC-2010 as development set. We call
this run TOPICSUMA+TOPICSUMB.

4.3 Automatic evaluation
DUALSUM and the three baselines6 have been

ing been optimized on the datasets from previous TAC com-
petitions.

automatically evaluated using the TAC-2011
dataset. Table 1 shows the ROUGE results ob-
tained. Because of the non-deterministic nature
of Gibbs sampling, the results reported here are
the average of five runs for all the baselines and
for DUALSUM. DUALSUM outperforms two of
the baselines in all three ROUGE metrics, and it
also outperforms TOPICSUMB on two of the three
metrics.

The top three systems in TAC-2011 have been
included for comparison. The results between
these three systems, and between them and DU-
ALSUM, are all indistinguishable at 95% confi-
dence. Note that the best baseline, TOPICSUMB,
is quite competitive, with results that are indis-
tinguishable to the top participants in this year’s
evaluation. Note as well that, because we have
five different runs for our algorithms, whereas
we just have one output for the TAC participants,
the confidence intervals in the second case were
slightly bigger when checking for statistical sig-
nificance, so it is slightly harder for these systems
to assert that they outperform the baselines with
95% confidence. These results would have made
DUALSUM the second best system for ROUGE-
1 and ROUGE-SU4, and the third best system in
terms of ROUGE-2.

The supplementary materials contain a detailed
example of the the topic model obtained for the
background in the TAC-2011 dataset, and the base
and update models for collection D1110. As
expected, the top unigrams and bigrams are all
closed-class words and auxiliary verbs. Because
trigrams are longer, background trigrams actu-
ally include some content words (e.g. university
or director). Regarding the models for φA and
φB, the base distribution contains words related
to the original event of an earthquake in Sichuan
province (China), and the update distribution fo-
cuses more on the official (updated) death toll
numbers. It can be noted here that the tokenizer
we used is very simple (splitting tokens separated
with white-spaces or punctuation) so that num-
bers such as 7.9 (the magnitude of the earthquake)
and 12,000 or 14,000 are divided into two tokens.
We thought this might be a for the bigram-based
system to produce better results, but we ran the
summarizers with a numbers-aware tokenizer and
the statistical differences between versions still
hold.

4.4 Manual evaluation

While the ROUGE metrics provides an arguable
estimate of the informativeness of a generated
summary, it does not account for other important
aspects such as the readability or the overall re-
sponsiveness. To evaluate such aspects, a manual
evaluation is required. A fairly standard approach
for manual evaluation is through pairwise com-
parison (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Ce-
likyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011).

In this approach, raters are presented with pairs
of summaries generated by two systems and they
are asked to say which one is best with respect
to some aspects. We followed a similar approach
to compare DualSum with Peer 43 - the best sys-
tem with respect to ROUGE-2, on the TAC 2011
dataset. For each collection, raters were presented
with three summaries: a reference summary ran-
domly chosen from the model summaries, and the
summaries generated by Peer 43 and DualSum.
They were asked to read the summaries and say
which one of the two generated summaries is best
with respect to: 1) Overall responsiveness: which
summary is best overall (both in terms of content
and fluency), 2) Focus: which summary contains
less irrelevant details, 3) Coherence: which sum-
mary is more coherent and 4) Non-redundancy:
which summary repeats less the same informa-
tion. For each aspect, the rater could also reply
that both summary were of the same quality.

For each of the 44 collections in TAC-2011, 3
ratings were collected from raters7. Results are
reported in Table 2. DualSum outperforms Peer
43 in three aspects, including Overall Responsive-
ness, which aggregates all the other scores and
can be considered the most important one. Re-

7In total 132 raters participated to the task via our own
crowdsourcing platform, not mentioned yet for blind review.

Best system

Coherence 39 30 63
Non-redundancy 40 53 39

Table 2: Results of the side-by-side manual evaluation.

garding Non-redundancy, DualSum and Peer 43
obtain similar results but the majority of raters
found no difference between the two systems.
Fleiss κ has been used to measure the inter-rater
agreement. For each aspect, we observe κ ∼ 0.2
which corresponds to a slight agreement; but if we
focus on tasks where the 3 ratings reflect a prefer-
ence for either of the two systems, then κ ∼ 0.5,
which indicates moderate agreement.

4.5 Efficiency and applicability

The running time for summarizing the TAC col-
lections with DualSum, averaged over a hundred
runs, is 4.97 minutes, using one core (2.3 GHz).
Memory consumption was 143 MB.

It is important to note as well that, while TOP-
ICSUM incorporates an additional layer to model
topic distributions at the sentence level, we noted
early in our experiments that this did not improve
the performance (as evaluated with ROUGE) and
consequently relaxed that assumption in Dual-
Sum. This resulted in a simplification of the
model and a reduction of the sampling time.

While five minutes is fast enough to be able
to experiment and tune parameters with the TAC
collections, it would be quite slow for a real-
time summarization system able to generate sum-
maries on request. As can be seen from the plate
diagram in Figure 2, all the collections are gen-
erated independently from each other. The only
exception, for which it is necessary to have all

221



the collections available at the same time dur-
ing Gibbs sampling, is the background distribu-
tion, which is estimated from all the collections
simultaneously, roughly representing 27% of the
words, that should appear distributed across all
documents.

The good news is that this background distri-
bution will contain closed-class words in the lan-
guage, which are domain-independent (see sup-
plementary material for examples). Therefore,
we can generate this distribution from one of
the TAC datasets only once, and then it can be
reused. Fixing the background distribution to a
pre-computed value requires a very simple mod-
ification of the Gibbs sampling implementation,
which just needs to adjust at each iteration the
collection and document-specific models, and the
topic assignment for the words.

Using this modified implementation, it is now
possible to summarize a single collection inde-
pendently. The summarization of a single col-
lection of the size of the TAC collections is re-
duced on average to only three seconds on the
same hardware settings, allowing the use of this
summarizer in an on-line application.

5 Conclusions

The main contribution of this paper is DUALSUM,
a new topic model that is specifically designed to
identify and extract novelty from pairs of collec-
tions.

It is inspired by TOPICSUM (Haghighi and
Vanderwende, 2009), with two main changes:
Firstly, while TOPICSUM can only learn the main
topic of a collection, DUALSUM focuses on the
differences between two collections. Secondly,
while TOPICSUM incorporates an additional layer
to model topic distributions at the sentence level,
we have found that relaxing this assumption and
modeling the topic distribution at document level
does not decrease the ROUGE scores and reduces
the sampling time.

The generated summaries, tested on the TAC-
2011 collection, would have resulted on the sec-
ond and third position in the last summarization
competition according to the different ROUGE
scores. This would make DUALSUM statistically
indistinguishable from the top system with 0.95
confidence.

We also propose and evaluate the applicability
of an alternative implementation of Gibbs sam-

pling to on-line settings. By fixing the back-
ground distribution we are able to summarize a
distribution in only three seconds, which seems
reasonable for some on-line applications.

As future work, we plan to explore the use of
DUALSUM to generate more general contrastive
summaries, by identifying differences between
collections whose differences are not of temporal
nature.
