Abstract

In this paper, we address the problem of op-
timizing the style of textual content to make
it more suitable to being listened to by a user
as opposed to being read. We study the dif-
ferences between the written style and the au-
dio style by consulting the linguistics and jour-
nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we
suggest a number of linguistic features to dis-
tinguish between the two styles. We show
the correctness of our features and the impact
of style transformation on the user experience
through statistical analysis, a style classifica-
tion task, and a user study.

1 Introduction

We live in a world with an ever increasing amount
and variety of information. A great deal of that con-
tent is in a textual format. Mobile technologies have
increased our expectations as to when, where, and
how we can access such content. As such, it is not
uncommon to want to gain access to this information
when a visual display is not convenient or available
(while driving or walking for example). One way of
addressing this issue is to use audio displays and, in
particular, have users listen to content read to them
by a speech synthesizer instead of reading it them-
selves on a display.

While listening to speech opens many opportu-
nities, it also has issues which must be considered
when using it as a replacement for reading. One im-
portant consideration is that the text that was origi-
nally written to be read might not be suitable to be
listened to. Journalists, for example, write differ-
ently for audio (i.e. radio news broadcast) compared

∗Work conducted while interning at Intel Labs

to writing content meant to be read (i.e. newspaper
articles) (Fang, 1991).

One key reason for the difference is that under-
standing is more important than grammar to a radio
news writer. Furthermore, audio has different per-
ceptual and information qualities compared to read-
ing. For example, the use of the negations not and
no should be limited since it is easy for listeners to
miss that single utterance. Listener cannot relisten to
a word; and, missing it has a huge impact on mean-
ing.

In this paper, we address the problem of changing
the writing-style of text to make it suitable to being
listened to instead of being read.

We start by researching the writing-style differ-
ences across text and audio in the linguistics and
journalism literatures. Based on this study, we sug-
gest a number of linguistic features that set the two
styles apart. We validate these features statistically
by analyzing their distributions in a corpus of paral-
lel text- and audio-style documents; and experimen-
tally through a style classification task. Moreover,
we evaluate the impact of style transformation on
the user experience by conducting a user study.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
the next section, we examine the related work. In
Section 3, we summarize the main style differences
as they appear in the journalism and linguistics lit-
eratures. In Section 4, we describe the data that we
collected and used in this work. The features that we
propose and their validation are discussed in Section
5. In Section 6, we describe the user study and dis-
cuss the results. We conclude in Section 7.

2 Related Work

There has been a considerable amount of research
on the language variations for different registers and

248



genres in the linguistics community, including re-
search that focused on the variations between writ-
ten and spoken language (Biber, 1988; Halliday,
1985; Esser, 1993; Whittaker et al., 1998; Esser,
2000). For example, Biber (1988) provides an ex-
haustive study of such variations. He uses compu-
tational techniques to analyze the linguistic charac-
teristics of twenty-three spoken and written genres,
enabling identification of the basic, underlying di-
mensions of variation in English.

Halliday (1985) performs a comparative study
of spoken and written language, contrasting the
prosodic features and grammatical intricacy of
speech with the high lexical density and grammat-
ical metaphor or writing. Esser (2000) proposes
a general framework for the different presentation
structures of medium-dependent linguistic units.

Most of these studies focus on the variations be-
tween the written and the spontaneous spoken lan-
guage. Our focus is on the written language for
audio, i.e. on a style that we hypothesize being
somewhere between the formally written and spon-
taneous speech styles. Fang (1991) provides a prag-
matic analysis and a side-by-side comparisons of the
”writing style differences in newspaper, radio, and
television news” as part of the instructions for jour-
nalist students learning to write for the three differ-
ent mediums.

Paraphrase generation (Barzilay and McKeown,
2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Quirk et al., 2004;
Power and Scot, 2005; Zhao et al., 2009; Madnani
and Dorr, 2010) is related to our work, but usually
the focus has been on the semantics, with the goal
of generating relevant content, and on the syntax to
generate well formed text. In this work the goal is to
optimize the style, and generation is one approach to
that end (we plan addressing it for future work)

Authorship attribution (Mosteller and Wallace,
1964; Stamatatos et al., 2000; Argamon et al., 2003;
Argamon et al., 2007; Schler and Argamon, 2009)
is also related to our work since arguably differ-
ent authors write in different styles. For exam-
ple, Argamon et al. (2003) explored differences
between male and female writing in a large sub-
set of the British National Corpus covering a range
of genres. Argamon el al. (2007) addressed the
problem of classifying texts by authors, author per-
sonality, gender of literary characters, sentiment

(positive/negative feeling), and scientific rhetorical
styles. They used lexical features based on tax-
onomies of various semantic functions of different
lexical items (words or phrases). These studies fo-
cused on the correlation between style of the text
and the personal characteristics of its author. In our
work, we focus on the change in writing style ac-
cording to the change of the medium.

3 Writing Style Differences Across Text
and Audio

In this section, we summarize the literature on writ-
ing style differences across text and audio. Style dif-
ferences are not due to happenstance. Writing styles
for different media have evolved due to the unique
nature of each medium and to the manner in which
its audience consumes it. For example, in audio, the
information must be consumed sequentially and the
listener does not have the option to skip the informa-
tion that she finds less interesting.

Also, the listener, unlike the reader, cannot stop
to review the meaning of a word or a sentence. The
eye skip around in text but there is not that option
with listening. Moreover, unlike attentive readers of
text, audio listeners may be engaged in some task
(e.g. driving, working, etc.) other than absorbing the
information they listen to, and therefore are paying
less attention.

All these differences of the audio medium affect
the length of sentences, the choice of words, the
structure of phrases of attribution, the use of pro-
nouns, etc.

Some general guidelines of audio style (Biber,
1988; Fang, 1991) include 1) the choice of sim-
ple words and short, declarative sentences with ac-
tive voice preferred. 2) Attribution precedes state-
ments as it does in normal conversations. 3) The
subject should be as close to the predicate as feasi-
ble. 4) Pronouns should be used with a lot of wari-
ness. It is better to repeat a name, so that the lis-
tener will not have to pause or replay to recall. 5)
Direct quotations are uncommon and the person be-
ing quoted is identified before the quotation. 6) De-
pendent clauses should be avoided, especially at the
start of a sentence. It is usually better to make a sep-
arate sentence of a dependent clause. 7) Numbers
should be approximated so that they can be under-

stated as more than fifty thousand dollars. 8) Adjec-
tives and adverbs should be used only when neces-
sary for the meaning.

4 Data

In order to determine the differences between the
text and audio styles, we needed textual data that
ideally covered the same semantic content but was
produced for the two different media. National
Public Radio (NPR) has exactly this type of data.
Through their APIs we obtained the same semantic
content in the two different styles: written text style
(articles, henceforth) and in audio style (transcripts,
henceforth). The NPR Story API output contains
links to the Transcript API when a transcript is avail-
able. With the Transcript API, we were able to get
full transcripts of stories heard on air1. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first use of this collection
for NLP research.

We collected 3855 news articles and their corre-
sponding transcripts. The data cover a varied set of
topics from four months of broadcast (from March 6
to June 3, 2010). Table 2 shows an example of such
article-transcript pairs.

5 Features

Based on the study of style differences outlined in
section 3, we propose a number of document-level,
linguistic features that we hypothesized distinguish
the two writing styles. We extracted these fea-

1http://www.npr.org/api/index

tures for each article and transcript. The analysis
of these features (will be discussed later in the sec-
tion) showed that they are of different importance to
style identification. Table 1 shows a list of the top
features and their descriptions.

5.1 Statistical Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to show that the values
of the features that we extracted are really different
across the two styles and that the difference is sig-
nificant. We compute the distribution of the values
of each feature in articles and its distribution in tran-
scripts. For example, Figure 1 shows the distribu-
tions of 3 features for both articles and transcripts.
The figure clearly shows how the distributions are
different. A two-tailed paired Student’s T-test (with
alpha set to 0.05) reveals statistically significant dif-
ference for all of the features (p < 0.0001).

This analysis corroborated our linguistic hypothe-
ses, such as the average sentence length is longer for
articles than for transcripts, complex words (more
than 3 syllables) are more common in articles, arti-
cles contain more adverbs, etc.

5.2 Classification

To further verify that our features really distinguish
between the two writing styles, we conducted a clas-
sification experiment. We used the features de-
scribed in Table 1 (excluding the Direct Quotation
feature) and the dataset described in section 4 to
train a classifier. We used Libsvm (Chang and Lin,
2001) with a linear kernel as our classifier. We per-
formed 10-fold cross validation on the entire dataset.

250



Feature Description Rank
Direct quotations We use a pattern matching rule to find all the instances of direct speech (e.g. ”I love English”, says

Peter).
1

Average sentence length The length of a sentence is the number of words it contains. 2
Ratio of complex words A complex word consists of three or more syllables (Gunning, 1952). Complex words are more

difficult to pronounce and harder to understand when being listened to than simpler words.
3

Ratio of pronouns We count the different types of pronouns; first person pronouns, second person pronouns, third
person pronoun, demonstrative pronouns (this, these, those), and the pronoun it.

4

Average distance between
each verb and its subject

We associate each verb with its subject by parsing the sentence using a dependency parser and
finding nsubj link. The distance is the word count between the verb and its subject.

5

Ratio of adjectives We count attributive adjectives (e.g. the big house) and predictive adjectives (e.g. the house is big)
separately.

6

Dependent clauses We identify dependent clauses by parsing the sentence and finding a SBAR node in the parse tree. 7
Average noun phrase mod-
ification degree

The average number of modifiers for all the noun phrases in the document. 8

Average number of sylla-
bles

The total number of syllables in the document divided by the number of words. To get an accurate
count of syllables in a word, we look up the word in a dictionary. All the numbers are converted
to words (e.g. 25 becomes twenty five). We also change all the contractions to their normal form
(e.g. I’ll becomes I will).

9

Ratio of passive sentences We find passive sentences using a pattern match rule against the part-of-speech tags of the sentence.
We compute the ratios of agentless passive sentences and by-passive sentences separately.

10

Ratio of adverbs In addition to counting all the adverbs, we also count special types of adverbs separately includ-
ing: amplifiers (e.g. absolutely, completely, enormously, etc), downtoners (e.g. almost, barely,
hardly, etc), place adverbials (e.g. abroad, above, across, etc), and time adverbials (e.g. after-
wards, eventually, initially, etc). The list of special adverbs and their types is taken from Quirk et.
al (1985).

11

Size of vocabulary The number of unique words in a document divided by the total number of words. 12
Ratio of verb tenses We count the three main types of verbs, present, past, and perfect aspect. 13
Ratio of approximated
numbers

We count the instance of approximated numbers in text. In particular, we count the pattern more
than/less than/about/almost ¡integer number¿.

Written article

The mammoth oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, sparked by the explo-

sion and sinking of a deep-water oil rig, now surrounds the Missis-

sippi River Delta, all but shutting down fisheries. But the oil industry

still has a lot of friends on the delta. As Louisianans fight the crude

invading their coast, many also want to repel efforts to limit offshore

drilling. “We need the oil industry, and down here, there are only

two industries – fishing and oil,” says charter boat captain Devlin

Roussel. Like most charter captains on the delta, Roussel has just

been sitting on the dock lately. But if he did have paying customers

to take out fishing, he’d most likely take them to an oil rig. [..]

Transcript

It’s MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I’m Steve Inskeep.

And I’m Renee Montagne. President Obama’s administration is

promising action on that catastrophic oil spill. The president’s en-

vironmental adviser says the BP oil leak will be plugged. More on

that in a moment. President Obama yesterday said the nation is too

dependent on fossil fuels. But you dont realize just how dependent

until you travel to the Mississippi River Delta. The fishing industry

there is all but shut down. Yet some residents do not want to stop

or slow offshore drilling despite the disaster. NPR’s Frank Morris

visited Buras, Louisiana [..]

Table 2: An example of an article–transcript pair.

Our classifier achieved 87.4% accuracy which is
high enough to feel confident about the features.

We excluded the Direct Quotation feature from
this experiment because it is a very distinguishing
feature for articles. The vast majority of the articles
in our dataset contained direct quotations and none
of the transcripts did. When this feature is included,
the accuracy rises to 97%.

To better understand which features are more im-
portant indicators of the style, we use Guyon et
al.’s (2002) method for feature selection using SVM
to rank the features based on their importance. The
ranks are shown in the last column in Table 1.

6 User Study

Up to this point, we know that there are differences
in style between articles and transcripts, and we for-
malized these differences in the form of linguistic
features that are easy to extract using computational
techniques. However, we still do not know the im-
pact of changing the style on the user experience. To
address this issue, we did manual transformation of
style for 50 article paragraphs. The transformation
was done in light of the features described in the pre-
vious section. For example, if a sentence is longer
than 25 words, we simplify it; and, if it is in passive
voice we change it to active voice whenever possi-
ble, etc. We used a speech synthesizer to convert the
original paragraphs and their transformed versions
into audio clips. We used these audio clips to con-
duct a user study.

We gave human participants the audio clips to lis-
ten to and transcribe. Each audio clip was divided
into segments 15 seconds long. Each segment can
be played only once and pauses automatically when
it is finished to allow the user to transcribe the seg-
ment. The user was not allowed to replay any seg-
ment of the clip. Our hypothesis for this study is
that audio clips of the transformed paragraphs (audio
style) are easier to comprehend, and hence, easier to
transcribe than the original paragraphs (text style).
We use the edit distance between the transcripts and
the text of each audio clip to measure the transcrip-
tion accuracy. We assume that the transcription ac-
curacy is an indicator for the comprehension level,
i.e. the higher the accuracy of the transcription the
higher the comprehension.

We used Amazon Mechanical Turk to run the user
study. We took several precautions to guarantee the
quality of the data (burch, 2009). We restricted the
workers to those who have more than 95% approval
rate for all their previous work and who live in the
United States (since we are targeting English speak-
ers). We also assigned the same audio clip to 10
different workers and took the average edit distance
of the 10 transcripts for each audio clip.

The differences in the transcription accuracy for
the original and the transformed paragraphs were
statically significant at the 0.05 level according to
a 2-tailed paired t-test. The overall average edit dis-
tance was 0.69 for the 50 transformed paragraphs

and 0.56 for the original article paragraphs. This re-
sult indicates that the change in style has an impact
on the comprehension of the delivered information
as measured by the accuracy of the transcriptions.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we presented the progress on an on-
going research on writing style transformation from
text style to audio style. We motivated the topic and
emphasized its importance. We surveyed the lin-
guistics and journalism literatures for the differences
in writing style for different media. We formalized
the problem by suggesting a number of linguistic
features and showing their validity in distinguishing
between the two styles of interest, text vs audio. We
also conducted a user study to show the impact of
style transformation on comprehension and the over-
all user experience.

The next step in this work would be to build a
style transformation system that uses the features
discussed in this paper as the bases for determining
when, where, and how to do the style transforma-
tion.
