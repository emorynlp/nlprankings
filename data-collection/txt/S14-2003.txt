Abstract

This paper introduces a new SemEval
task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity
(CLSS), which measures the degree to
which the meaning of a larger linguistic
item, such as a paragraph, is captured by
a smaller item, such as a sentence. High-
quality data sets were constructed for four
comparison types using multi-stage an-
notation procedures with a graded scale
of similarity. Nineteen teams submitted
38 systems. Most systems surpassed the
baseline performance, with several attain-
ing high performance for multiple com-
parison types. Further, our results show
that comparisons of semantic representa-
tion increase performance beyond what is
possible with text alone.

1 Introduction
Given two linguistic items, semantic similarity
measures the degree to which the two items have
the same meaning. Semantic similarity is an es-
sential component of many applications in Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP), and similarity
measurements between all types of text as well
as between word senses lend themselves to a va-
riety of NLP tasks such as information retrieval
(Hliaoutakis et al., 2006) or paraphrasing (Glick-
man and Dagan, 2003).

Semantic similarity evaluations have largely fo-
cused on comparing similar types of lexical items.
Most recently, tasks in SemEval (Agirre et al.,
2012) and *SEM (Agirre et al., 2013) have intro-
duced benchmarks for measuring Semantic Tex-
tual Similarity (STS) between similar-sized sen-
tences and phrases. Other data sets such as that

of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) measure
similarity between word pairs, while the data sets
of Navigli (2006) and Kilgarriff (2001) offer a bi-
nary similar-dissimilar distinction between senses.
Notably, all of these evaluations have focused on
comparisons between a single type, in contrast to
application-based evaluations such as summariza-
tion and compositionality which incorporate tex-
tual items of different sizes, e.g., measuring the
quality of a paragraph’s sentence summarization.

Task 3 introduces a new evaluation where sim-
ilarity is measured between items of different
types: paragraphs, sentences, phrases, words and
senses. Given an item of the lexically-larger type,
a system measures the degree to which the mean-
ing of the larger item is captured in the smaller
type, e.g., comparing a paragraph to a sentence.
We refer to this task as Cross-Level Semantic Sim-
ilarity (CLSS). A major motivation of this task
is to produce semantic similarity systems that are
able to compare all types of text, thereby free-
ing downstream NLP applications from needing to
consider the type of text being compared. Task 3
enables assessing the extent to which the mean-
ing of the sentence “do u know where i can watch
free older movies online without download?” is
captured in the phrase “streaming vintage movies
for free”, or how similar is “circumscribe” to the
phrase “beating around the bush.” Furthermore,
by incorporating comparisons of a variety of item
sizes, Task 3 unifies in a single task multiple ob-
jectives from different areas of NLP such as para-
phrasing, summarization, and compositionality.

Because CLSS generalizes STS to items of dif-
ferent types, successful CLSS systems can directly
be applied to all STS-based applications. Fur-
thermore, CLSS systems can be used in other
similarity-based applications such as text simpli-
fication (Specia et al., 2012), keyphrase iden-
tification (Kim et al., 2010), lexical substitu-
tion (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009), summariza-

17



tion (Spärck Jones, 2007), gloss-to-sense mapping
(Pilehvar and Navigli, 2014b), and modeling the
semantics of multi-word expressions (Marelli et
al., 2014) or polysemous words (Pilehvar and Nav-
igli, 2014a).

Task 3 was designed with three main objectives.
First, the task should include multiple types of
comparison in order to assess each type’s difficulty
and whether specialized resources are needed for
each. Second, the task should incorporate text
from multiple domains and writing styles to en-
sure that system performance is robust across text
types. Third, the similarity methods should be able
to operate at the sense level, thereby potentially
uniting text- and sense-based similarity methods
within a single framework.

2 Task Description

2.1 Objective

Task 3 is intended to serve as an initial task for
evaluating the capabilities of systems at measuring
all types of semantic similarity, independently of
the size of the text. To accomplish this objective,
systems were presented with items from four com-
parison types: (1) paragraph to sentence, (2) sen-
tence to phrase, (3) phrase to word, and (4) word to
sense. Given a pair of items, a system must assess
the degree to which the meaning of the larger item
is captured in the smaller item. WordNet 3.0 was
chosen as the sense inventory (Fellbaum, 1998).

2.2 Rating Scale

Following previous SemEval tasks (Agirre et al.,
2012; Jurgens et al., 2012), Task 3 recognizes that
two items’ similarity may fall within a range of
similarity values, rather than having a binary no-
tion of similar or dissimilar. Initially a six-point
(0–5) scale similar to that used in the STS tasks
was considered (Agirre et al., 2012); however, an-
notators found difficulty in deciding between the
lower-similarity options. After multiple revisions
and feedback from a group of initial annotators,
we developed a five-point Likert scale for rating a
pair’s similarity, shown in Table 1.1

The scale was designed to systematically order
a broad range of semantic relations: synonymy,
similarity, relatedness, topical association, and un-
relatedness. Because items are of different sizes,
the highest rating is defined as very similar rather

than identical to allow for some small loss in the
overall meaning. Furthermore, although the scale
is designed as a Likert scale, annotators were given
flexibility when rating items to use values between
the defined points in the scale, indicating a blend
of two relations. Table 2 provides examples of
pairs for each scale rating for all four comparison
type.

3 Task Data
Though several data sets exist for STS and com-
paring words and senses, no standard data set ex-
ists for CLSS. Therefore, we created a pilot data
set designed to test the capabilities of systems in a
variety of settings. The task data for all compar-
isons but word-to-sense was created using a three-
phase process. First, items of all sizes were se-
lected from publicly-available data sets. Second,
the selected items were used to produce a second
item of the next-smaller level (e.g., a sentence in-
spires a phrase). Third, the pairs of items were
annotated for their similarity. Because of the ex-
pertise required for working with word senses, the
word-to-sense data set was constructed by the or-
ganizers using a separate but similar process. In
the training and test data, each comparison type
had 500 annotated examples, for a total of 2000
pairs each for training and test. We first describe
the corpora used by Task 3 followed by the anno-
tation process. We then describe the construction
of the word-to-sense data set.

3.1 Corpora

Test and training data were constructed by draw-
ing from multiple publicly-available corpora and
then manually generating a paired item for com-
parison. To achieve our second objective for the
task, the data sets used to create item pairs in-
cluded texts from specific domains, social media,
and text with idiomatic or slang language. Table
3 summarizes the corpora and their distribution
across the test and training sets for each compari-
son type, with a high-level description of the genre
of the data. We briefly describe the corpora next.

The WikiNews, Reuters 21578, and Microsoft
Research (MSR) Paraphrase corpora are all drawn
from newswire text, with WikiNews being au-
thored by volunteer writers and the latter two cor-
pora written by professionals. Travel Guides was
drawn from the Berlitz travel guides data in the
Open American National Corpus (Ide and Suder-
man, 2004) and includes very verbose sentences

4 – Very
Similar

The two items have very similar meanings and the most important ideas, concepts, or actions in the larger
text are represented in the smaller text. Some less important information may be missing, but the smaller
text is a very good summary of the larger text.

3 – Somewhat
Similar

The two items share many of the same important ideas, concepts, or actions, but include slightly different
details. The smaller text may use similar but not identical concepts (e.g., car vs. vehicle), or may omit a
few of the more important ideas present in the larger text.

2 – Somewhat
related but not
similar

The two items have dissimilar meaning, but share concepts, ideas, and actions that are related. The smaller
text may use related but not necessarily similar concepts (window vs. house) but should still share some
overlapping concepts, ideas, or actions with the larger text.

1 – Slightly
related

The two items describe dissimilar concepts, ideas and actions, but may share some small details or domain
in common and might be likely to be found together in a longer document on the same topic.

0 – Unrelated The two items do not mean the same thing and are not on the same topic.

with many named entities. Wikipedia Science
was drawn from articles tagged with the cate-
gory Science on Wikipedia. Food reviews were
drawn from the SNAP Amazon Fine Food Re-
views data set (McAuley and Leskovec, 2013)
and are customer-authored reviews for a variety of
food items. Fables were taken from a collection of
Aesop’s Fables. The Yahoo! Answers corpus was
derived from the Yahoo! Answers data set, which
is a collection of questions and answers from the
Community Question Answering (CQA) site; the
data set is notable for having the highest degree of
ungrammaticality in our test set. SMT Europarl
is a collection of texts from the English-language
proceedings of the European parliament (Koehn,
2005); Europarl data was also used in the PPDB
corpus (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), from which
phrases were extracted. Wikipedia was used to
generate two phrase data sets from (1) extracting
the definitional portion of an article’s initial sen-
tence, e.g., “An [article name] is a [definition],”
and (2) captions for an article’s images. Web
queries were gathered from online sources of real-
world queries. Last, the first and second authors
generated slang and idiomatic phrases based on
expressions contained in Wiktionary.

For all comparison types, the test data included
one genre that was not seen in the training data
in order to test the generalizability of the systems
on data from a novel domain. In addition, we
included a new type of challenge genre with Fa-
bles; unlike other domains, the sentences paired
with the fable paragraphs were potentially seman-
tic interpretations of the intent of the fable, i.e.,
the moral of the story. These interpretations often
have little textual overlap with the fable itself and
require a deeper interpretation of the paragraph’s

meaning in order to make the correct similarity
judgment.

Prior to the annotation process, all content was
filtered to ensure its size and format matched the
desired text type. By average, a paragraph in our
dataset consists of 3.8 sentences. Typos and gram-
matical mistakes in the community-produced con-
tent were left unchanged.

3.2 Annotation Process

A two-phase process was used to produce the test
and training data sets for all but word-to-sense.
Phase 1 generates the item pairs from source texts
and Phase 2 rates the pairs’ similarity.
Phase 1 In this phase, annotators were shown the
larger text of a comparison type and then asked
to produce the smaller text of the pair at a spec-
ified similarity; for example an annotator may be
shown a paragraph and asked to write a sentence
that is a “3” rating. Annotators were instructed to
leave the smaller text blank if they had difficulty
understanding the larger text.

The requested similarity ratings were balanced
to create a uniform distribution of similarity val-
ues. Annotators were asked only to generate rat-
ings of 1–4; pairs with a “0” rating were automat-
ically created by pairing the larger item with ran-
dom selections of text of the appropriate size from
the same corpus. The intent of Phase 1 is to pro-
duce varied item pairs with an expected uniform
distribution of similarity values along the rating
scale.

Four annotators participated in Phase 1 and
were paid a bulk rate of e110 for completing the
work. In addition to the four annotators, the first
two organizers also assisted in Phase 1: Both com-
pleted items from the SCIENTIFIC genre and the
first organizer produced 994 pairs, including all

those for the METAPHORIC genre, and those that
the other annotators left blank.
Phase 2 Here, the item pairs produced in Phase
1 were rated for their similarity according to the
scale described in Section 2.2. An initial pilot
study showed that crowdsourcing was only mod-
erately effective for producing these ratings with
high agreement. Furthermore, the texts used in
Task 3 came from a variety of genres, such as
scientific domains, which some workers had dif-
ficulty understanding. While we note that crowd-
sourcing has been used in prior STS tasks for
generating similarity scores (Agirre et al., 2012;
Agirre et al., 2013), both tasks’ efforts encoun-
tered lower worker score correlations on some por-
tions of the dataset (Diab, 2013), suggesting that
crowdsourcing may not be reliable for judging the
similarity of certain types of text. See Section 3.5
for additional details.

Therefore, to ensure high quality, the first two
organizers rated all items independently. Because
the sentence-to-phrase and phrase-to-word com-
parisons contain slang and idiomatic language, a
third American English mother tongue annotator
was added for those data sets. The third annotator
was compensated e250 for their assistance.

Annotators were allowed to make finer-grained
distinctions in similarity using multiples of 0.25.
For all items, when any two annotators disagreed
by one or more scale points, we performed an
adjudication to determine the item’s rating in the
gold standard. The adjudication process revealed
that nearly all disagreements were due to annota-
tor mistakes, e.g., where one annotator had over-
looked a part of the text or had misunderstood the
text’s meaning. The final similarity rating for an
unadjudicated item was the average of its ratings.

3.3 Word-to-Sense

Word-to-sense comparison items were generated
in three phases. To increase the diversity and
challenge of the data set, the word-to-sense was
created for four types of words: (1) a word and
its intended meaning are in WordNet, (2) a word
was not in the WordNet vocabulary, e.g., the verb
“zombify,” (3) the word is in WordNet, but has a
novel meaning that is not in WordNet, e.g., the ad-
jective “red” referring to Communist, and (4) a set
of challenge words where one of the word’s senses
and a second sense are directly connected by an
edge in the WordNet network, but the two senses
are not always highly similar.

Table 3: Percentages of the training and test data per source corpus.

In Phase 1, to select the first type of word,
lemmas in WordNet were ranked by frequency
in Wikipedia; the ranking was divided into ten
equally-sized groups, with words sampled evenly
from groups in order to control for word frequency
in the task data. For the second type, words not
present in WordNet were drawn from two sources:
examining words in Wikipedia, which we refer
to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV), and slang words.
For the third type, to identify words with a novel
sense, we examined Wiktionary entries and chose
novel, salient senses that were distinct from those
in WordNet. We refer to words with a novel mean-
ing as out-of-sense (OOS). Words of the fourth
type were chosen by hand. The part-of-speech dis-
tributions for all four types of items were balanced
as 50% noun, 25% verb, 25% adjective.

In Phase 2, each word was associated with a
particular WordNet sense for its intended mean-
ing, or the closest available sense in WordNet
for OOV or OOS items. To select a comparison
sense, we adopted a neighborhood search proce-
dure: All synsets connected by at most three edges
in the WordNet semantic network were shown.
Given a word and its neighborhood, the corre-
sponding sense for the item pair was selected by
matching the sense with an intended similarity for
the pair, much like how text items were gener-
ated in Phase 1. The reason behind using this
neighborhood-based selection process was to min-
imize the potential bias of consistently selecting
lower-similarity items from those further away in
the WordNet semantic network.

In Phase 3, given all word-sense pairs, annota-
tors were shown the definitions associated with the
intended meaning of the word and of the sense.

Definitions were drawn from WordNet or from
Wiktionary, if the word was OOV or OOS. An-
notators had access to the WordNet structure for
the compared sense in order to take into account
its parents and siblings.

3.4 Trial Data

The trial data set was created using a separate
process. Source text was drawn from WikiNews;
we selected the text for the larger item of each
level and then generated the text or sense of the
smaller. A total of 156 items were produced.
After, four fluent annotators independently rated
all items. Inter-annotator agreement rates varied
in 0.734–0.882, using Krippendorff’s α (Krippen-
dorff, 2004) on the interval scale.

3.5 Data Set Discussion

The resulting annotation process produced a high-
quality data set. First, Table 4 shows the inter-
annotator agreement (IAA) statistics for each
comparison type on both the full and unadjudi-
cated portions of the data set. IAA was measured
using Krippendorff’s α for interval data. Because
the disagreements that led to lower α in the full
data were resolved via adjudication, the quality of
the full data set is expected to be on par with that
of the unadjudicated data. The annotation quality
for Task 3 was further improved by manually ad-
judicating all significant disagreements.

In contrast, the data sets of current STS tasks
aggregated data from annotators with moderate
correlation with each other (Diab, 2013); STS-
2012 (Agirre et al., 2012) saw inter-annotator
Pearson correlations of 0.530–0.874 per data set
and STS-2013 (Agirre et al., 2013) had average

inter-annotator correlations of 0.377–0.832. How-
ever, we note that Pearson correlation and Krip-
pendorff’s α are not directly comparable (Artstein
and Poesio, 2008), as annotators’ scores may be
correlated, but completely disagree.

Second, the two-phase construction process
produced values that were evenly distributed
across the rating scale, shown in Figure 1 as the
distribution of the values for all data sets. How-
ever, we note that this creation procedure was very
resource intensive and, therefore, semi-automated
or crowdsourcing-based approaches for produc-
ing high-quality data will be needed to expand
the size of the data in future CLSS-based eval-
uations. Nevertheless, as a pilot task, the man-
ual effort was essential for ensuring a rigorously-
constructed data set for the initial evaluation.

4 Evaluation

Participation The ultimate goal of Task 3 is to
produce systems that can measure similarity for
multiple types of items. Therefore, we strongly
encouraged participating teams to submit systems
that were capable of generating similarity judg-
ments for multiple comparison types. However,
to further the analysis, participants were also per-
mitted to submit systems specialized to a single

domain. Teams were allowed at most three system
submissions, regardless of the number of compar-
ison types supported.

Scoring Systems were required to provide sim-
ilarity values for all items within a comparison
type. Following prior STS evaluations, systems
were scored for each comparison type using Pear-
son correlation. Additionally, we include a second
score using Spearman’s rank correlation, which is
only affected by differences in the ranking of items
by similarity, rather than differences in the similar-
ity values. Pearson correlation was chosen as the
official evaluation metric since the goal of the task
is to produce similar scores. However, Spearman’s
rank correlation provides an important metric for
assessing systems whose scores do not match hu-
man scores but whose rankings might, e.g., string-
similarity measures. Ultimately, a global ranking
was produced by ordering systems by the sum of
their Pearson correlation values for each of the
four comparison levels.

Baselines The official baseline system was
based on the Longest Common Substring (LCS),
normalized by the length of items using the
method of Clough and Stevenson (2011). Given
a pair, the similarity is reported as the normalized
length of the LCS. In the case of word-to-sense,
the LCS for a word-sense pair is measured be-
tween the sense’s definition in WordNet and the
definitions of each sense of the pair’s word, report-
ing the maximal LCS. Because OOV and slang
words are not in WordNet, the baseline reports the
average similarity value of non-OOV items. Base-
line scores were made public after the evaluation
period ended.

Because LCS is a simple procedure, a second
baseline based on Greedy String Tiling (GST)
(Wise, 1996) was added after the evaluation pe-
riod concluded. Unlike LCS, GST better handles
the transpositions of tokens across the two texts
and can still report high similarity when encoun-
tering reordered text. The minimum match length
for GST was set to 6.

5 Results
Nineteen teams submitted 38 systems. Of those
systems, 34 produced values for paragraph-to-
sentence and sentence-to-phrase comparisons, 22
for phrase-to-word, and 20 for word-to-sense.
Two teams submitted revised scores for their sys-
tems after the deadline but before the test set had

Table 5: Task results. Systems marked with a † were submitted after the deadline but are positioned

been released. These systems were scored and
noted in the results but were not included in the
official ranking.

Table 5 shows the performance of the participat-
ing systems across all the four comparison types in
terms of Pearson correlation. The two right-most
columns show system rankings by Pearson (Offi-
cial Rank) and Spearman’s ranks correlation.

The SimCompass system attained first place,
partially due to its superior performance on
phrase-to-word comparisons, providing an im-
provement of 0.10 over the second-best sys-
tem. The late-submitted version of the Meerkat

Mafia pairingWords† system corrected a bug in
the phrase-to-word comparison, which ultimately
would have attained first place due to large per-
formance improvements over SimCompass on
phrase-to-word and word-to-sense. ENCU and
UNAL-NLP systems rank respectively second and
third while the former being always in top-4 and
the latter being among the top-7 systems across the
four comparison types. Most systems were able
to surpass the naive LCS baseline; however, the
more sophisticated GST baseline (which accounts
for text transposition) outperforms two-thirds of
the systems. Importantly, both baselines perform

23



poorly on smaller text, highlighting the impor-
tance of performing a semantic comparison, as op-
posed to a string-based one.

Within the individual comparison types, spe-
cialized systems performed well for the larger
text sizes. In the paragraph-to-sentence type, the
run1 system of UNAL-NLP provides the best of-
ficial result, with the late RTM-DCU run1† sys-
tem surpassing its performance slightly. Meerkat
Mafia provides the best performance in sentence-
to-phrase with its SuperSaiyan system and the
best performances in phrase-to-word and word-to-
sense with its late pairingWords† system.
Comparison-Type Analysis Performance
across the comparison types varied considerably,
with systems performing best on comparisons
between longer textual items. As a general trend,
both the baselines’ and systems’ performances
tend to decrease with the size of lexical items
in the comparison types. A main contributing
factor to this is the reliance on textual similarity
measures (such as the baselines), which perform
well when two items’ may share content. How-
ever, as the items’ content becomes smaller, e.g.,
a word or phrase, the textual similarity does not
necessarily provide a meaningful indication of
the semantic similarity between the two. This
performance discrepancy suggests that, in order
to perform well, CLSS systems must rely on
comparisons between semantic representations
rather than textual representations. The two
top-performing systems on these smaller levels,
Meerkat Mafia and SimCompass, used additional
resources beyond WordNet to expand a word or
sense to its definition or to represent words with
distributional representations.

Per-genre results and discussions Task 3 in-
cludes multiple genres within the data set for each
comparison type. Figure 2 shows the correlation
of each system for each of these genres, with sys-
tems ordered left to right according to their official
ranking in Table 5. An interesting observation is
that a system’s official rank does not always match
the rank from aggregating its correlations for each
genre individually. This difference suggests that
some systems provided good similarity judgments
on individual genres, but their range of similarity
values was not consistent between genres leading
to lower overall Pearson correlation. For instance,
in the phrase-to-word comparison type, the ag-
gregated per-genre performance of Duluth-1 and

Duluth-3 are among the best whereas their over-
all Pearson performance puts these systems among
the worst-performing ones in the comparison type.

Among the genres, CQA, SLANG, and ID-
IOMATIC prove to be the more difficult for sys-
tems to interpret and judge. These genres in-
cluded misspelled, colloquial, or slang language
which required converting the text into semantic
form in order to meaningfully compare it. Fur-
thermore, as expected, the METAPHORIC genre
was the most difficult, with no system perform-
ing well; we view the METAPHORIC genre as an
open challenge for future systems to address when
interpreting larger text. On the other hand, SCI-
ENTIFIC, TRAVEL, and NEWSWIRE tend to be
the easiest genres for paragraph-to-sentence and
sentence-to-phrase. All three genres tend to in-
clude many named entities or highly-specific lan-
guage, which are likely to be more preserved in the
more-similar paired items. Similarly, DESCRIP-
TIVE and SEARCH genres were easiest in phrase-
to-word, which also often featured specific words
that were preserved in highly-similar pairs. In
the case of word-to-sense, REGULAR proves to be
the least difficult genre. Interestingly, in word-
to-sense, most systems attained moderate perfor-
mance for comparisons with words not in Word-
Net (i.e., OOV) but had poor performance for
slang words, which were also OOV. This differ-
ence suggests that systems could be improved with
additional semantic resources for slang.

Spearman Rank Analysis Although the goal of
Task 3 is to have systems produce similarity judg-
ments, some applications may benefit from simply
having a ranking of pairs, e.g., ranking summa-
rizations by goodness. The Spearman rank corre-
lation measures the ability of systems to perform
such a ranking. Surprisingly, with the Spearman-
based ranking, the Duluth1 and Duluth3 systems
attain the third and fifth ranks – despite being
among the lowest ranked with Pearson. Both sys-
tems were unsupervised and produced similarity
values that did not correlate well with those of
humans. However, their Spearman ranks demon-
strate the systems ability to correctly identify rela-
tive similarity and suggests that such unsupervised
systems could improve their Pearson correlation
by using the training data to tune the range of sim-
ilarity values to match those of humans.

6 Conclusion
This paper introduces a new similarity task, Cross-
Level Semantic Similarity, for measuring the se-
mantic similarity of lexical items of different
sizes. Using a multi-phase annotation proce-
dure, we have produced a high-quality data set of
4000 items comprising of various genres, evenly-
split between training and test with four types of
comparison: paragraph-to-sentence, sentence-to-
phrase, phrase-to-word, and word-to-sense. Nine-
teen teams submitted 38 systems, with most teams
surpassing the baseline system and several sys-
tems achieving high performance in multiple types
of comparison. However, a clear performance
trend emerged where systems perform well only
when the text itself is similar, rather than its under-
lying meaning. Nevertheless, the results of Task 3
are highly encouraging and point to clear future
objectives for developing CLSS systems that op-
erate on more semantic representations rather than
text. In future work on CLSS evaluation, we first
intend to develop scalable annotation methods to
increase the data sets. Second, we plan to add new

evaluations where systems are tested according to
their performance in an application related to each
comparison-type, such as measuring the quality of
a paraphrase or summary.
