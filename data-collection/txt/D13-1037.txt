Abstract

This paper addresses the task of predicting the
correct French translations of third-person sub-
ject pronouns in English discourse, a problem
that is relevant as a prerequisite for machine
translation and that requires anaphora resolu-
tion. We present an approach based on neu-
ral networks that models anaphoric links as
latent variables and show that its performance
is competitive with that of a system with sep-
arate anaphora resolution while not requiring
any coreference-annotated training data. This
demonstrates that the information contained in
parallel bitexts can successfully be used to ac-
quire knowledge about pronominal anaphora
in an unsupervised way.

1 Motivation

When texts are translated from one language into
another, the translation reconstructs the meaning or
function of the source text with the means of the
target language. Generally, this has the effect that
the entities occurring in the translation and their mu-
tual relations will display similar patterns as the enti-
ties in the source text. In particular, coreference pat-
terns tend to be very similar in translations of a text,
and this fact has been exploited with good results to
project coreference annotations from one language
into another by using word alignments (Postolache
et al., 2006; Rahman and Ng, 2012).

On the other hand, what is true in general need
not be true for all types of linguistic elements. For
instance, a substantial percentage of the English third-
person subject pronouns he, she, it and they does
not get realised as pronouns in French translations
(Hardmeier, 2012). Moreover, it has been recognised

by various authors in the statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) community (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010;
Hardmeier and Federico, 2010; Guillou, 2012) that
pronoun translation is a difficult problem because,
even when a pronoun does get translated as a pro-
noun, it may require choosing the correct word form
based on agreement features that are not easily pre-
dictable from the source text.

The work presented in this paper investigates
the problem of cross-lingual pronoun prediction for
English-French. Given an English pronoun and its
discourse context as well as a French translation of
the same discourse and word alignments between
the two languages, we attempt to predict the French
word aligned to the English pronoun. As far as we
know, this task has not been addressed in the litera-
ture before. In our opinion, it is interesting for several
reasons. By studying pronoun prediction as a task in
its own right, we hope to contribute towards a better
understanding of pronoun translation with a long-
term view to improving the performance of SMT
systems. Moreover, we believe that this task can lead
to interesting insights about anaphora resolution in a
multi-lingual context. In particular, we show in this
paper that the pronoun prediction task makes it possi-
ble to model the resolution of pronominal anaphora
as a latent variable and opens up a way to solve a
task relying on anaphora resolution without using
any data annotated for anaphora. This is what we
consider the main contribution of our present work.

We start by modelling cross-lingual pronoun pre-
diction as an independent machine learning task after
doing anaphora resolution in the source language
(English) using the BART software (Broscheit et
al., 2010). We show that it is difficult to achieve
satisfactory performance with standard maximum-

entropy classifiers especially for low-frequency pro-
nouns such as the French feminine plural pronoun
elles. We propose a neural network classifier that
achieves better precision and recall and manages to
make reasonable predictions for all pronoun cate-
gories in many cases.

We then go on to extend our neural network archi-
tecture to include anaphoric links as latent variables.
We demonstrate that our classifier, now with its own
source language anaphora resolver, can be trained
successfully with backpropagation. In this setup, we
no longer use the machine learning component in-
cluded in the external coreference resolution system
(BART) to predict anaphoric links. Anaphora reso-
lution is done by our neural network classifier and
requires only some quantity of word-aligned parallel
data for training, completely obviating the need for a
coreference-annotated training set.

2 Task Setup

The overall setup of the classification task we address
in this paper is shown in Figure 1. We are given an
English discourse containing a pronoun along with
its French translation and word alignments between
the two languages, which in our case were computed
automatically using a standard SMT pipeline with
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). We focus on the four
English third-person subject pronouns he, she, it and
they. The output of the classifier is a multinomial
distribution over six classes: the four French subject
pronouns il, elle, ils and elles, corresponding to mas-
culine and feminine singular and plural, respectively;
the impersonal pronoun ce/c’, which occurs in some
very frequent constructions such as c’est (it is); and
a sixth class OTHER, which indicates that none of
these pronouns was used. In general, a pronoun may
be aligned to multiple words; in this case, a training
example is counted as a positive example for a class
if the target word occurs among the words aligned
to the pronoun, irrespective of the presence of other

aligned tokens.
This task setup resembles the problem that an

SMT system would have to solve to make informed
choices when translating pronouns, an aspect of trans-
lation neglected by most existing SMT systems. An
important difference between the SMT setup and our
own classifiers is that we use context from human-
made translations for prediction. This potentially
makes the task both easier and more difficult; easier,
because the context can be relied on to be correctly
translated, and more difficult, because human transla-
tors frequently create less literal translations than an
SMT system would. Integrating pronoun prediction
into the translation process would require significant
changes to the standard SMT decoding setup in order
to take long-range dependencies in the target lan-
guage into account, which is why we do not address
this issue in our current work.

In all the experiments presented in this paper, we
used features from two different sources:

– Anaphora context features describe the source
language pronoun and its immediate context
consisting of three words to its left and three
words to its right. They are encoded as vec-
tors whose dimensionality is equal to the source
vocabulary size with a single non-zero compo-
nent indicating the word referred to (one-hot
vectors).

– Antecedent features describe an antecedent can-
didate. Antecedent candidates are represented
by the target language words aligned to the syn-
tactic head of the source language markable

The different handling of anaphora context features
and antecedent features is due to the fact that we al-
ways consider a constant number of context words
on the source side, whereas the number of word
vectors to be considered depends on the number of
antecedent candidates and on the number of target
words aligned to each antecedent.

The encoding of the antecedent features is illus-
trated in Figure 2 for a training example with two
antecedent candidates translated to elle and la ver-
sion, respectively. The target words are represented
as one-hot vectors with the dimensionality of the tar-
get language vocabulary. These vectors are then av-
eraged to yield a single vector per antecedent candi-
date. Finally, the vectors of all candidates for a given
training example are weighted by the probabilities
assigned to them by the anaphora resolver (p1 and
p2) and summed to yield a single vector per training
example.

3 Data Sets and External Tools

We run experiments with two different test sets. The
TED data set consists of around 2.6 million tokens of
lecture subtitles released in the WIT3 corpus (Cet-
tolo et al., 2012). The WIT3 training data yields
71,052 examples, which were randomly partitioned
into a training set of 63,228 examples and a test set
of 7,824 examples. The official WIT3 development
and test sets were not used in our experiments. The
news-commentary data set is version 6 of the parallel
news-commentary corpus released as a part of the
WMT 2011 training data1. It contains around 2.8 mil-
lion tokens of news text and yields 31,017 data points,

html (3 July 2013).

which were randomly split into 27,900 training exam-
ples and 3,117 test instances. The distribution of the
classes in the two training sets is shown in Table 1.
One thing to note is the dominance of the OTHER
class, which pools together such different phenom-
ena as translations with other pronouns not in our list
(e. g., celui-ci) and translations with full noun phrases
instead of pronouns. Splitting this group into more
meaningful subcategories is not straightforward and
must be left to future work.

The feature setup of all our classifiers requires
the detection of potential antecedents and the extrac-
tion of features pairing anaphoric pronouns with an-
tecedent candidates. Some of our experiments also
rely on an external anaphora resolution component.
We use the open-source anaphora resolver BART to
generate this information. BART (Broscheit et al.,
2010) is an anaphora resolution toolkit consisting of
a markable detection and feature extraction pipeline
based on a variety of standard natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) tools and a machine learning com-
ponent to predict coreference links including both
pronominal anaphora and noun-noun coreference. In
our experiments, we always use BART’s markable
detection and feature extraction machinery. Mark-
able detection is based on the identification of noun
phrases in constituency parses generated with the
Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). The set
of features extracted by BART is an extension of the
widely used mention-pair anaphora resolution feature
set by Soon et al. (2001) (see below, Section 6).

In the experiments of the next two sections, we
also use BART to predict anaphoric links for pro-
nouns. The model used with BART is a maximum
entropy ranker trained on the ACE02-npaper corpus
(LDC2003T11). In order to obtain a probability dis-
tribution over antecedent candidates rather than one-
best predictions or coreference sets, we modified the
ranking component with which BART resolves pro-
nouns to normalise and output the scores assigned
by the ranker to all candidates instead of picking the
highest-scoring candidate.

classifier with the MegaM software package2 using
the features described in the previous section and the
anaphora links found by BART. Results are shown
in Table 2. The baseline results show an overall
higher accuracy for the TED data than for the news-
commentary data. While the precision is above 50 %
in all categories and considerably higher in some,
recall varies widely.

The pronoun elles is particularly interesting. This
is the feminine plural of the personal pronoun, and
it usually corresponds to the English pronoun they,
which is not marked for gender. In French, elles is a
marked choice which is only used if the antecedent
exclusively refers to females or feminine-gendered
objects. The presence of a single item with mascu-
line grammatical gender in the antecedent will trigger
the use of the masculine plural pronoun ils instead.
This distinction cannot be predicted from the English
source pronoun or its context; making correct pre-
dictions requires knowledge about the antecedent of
the pronoun. Moreover, elles is a low-frequency pro-
noun. There are only 1,909 occurrences of this pro-

noun in the TED training data, and 1,077 in the news-
commentary training set. Because of these special
properties of the feminine plural class, we argue that
the performance of a classifier on elles is a good indi-
cator of how well it can represent relevant knowledge
about pronominal anaphora as opposed to overfitting
to source contexts or acting on prior assumptions
about class frequencies.

In accordance with the general linguistic prefer-
ence for ils, the classifier tends to predict ils much
more often than elles when encountering an English
plural pronoun. This is reflected in the fact that elles
has much lower recall than ils. Clearly, the classifier
achieves a good part of its accuracy by making ma-
jority choices without exploiting deeper knowledge
about the antecedents of pronouns.

An additional experiment with a subset of 27,900
training examples from the TED data confirms that
the difference between TED and news commentaries
is not just an effect of training data size, but that TED
data is genuinely easier to predict than news com-
mentaries. In the reduced data TED condition, the
classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.673. Precision
and recall of all classifiers are much closer to the

tary experiments, except for elles, where we obtain
an F-score of 0.072 (P 0.818, R 0.038), indicating
that small training data size is a serious problem for
this low-frequency class.

5 Neural Network Classifier

In the previous section, we saw that a simple multi-
class maximum entropy classifier, while making cor-
rect predictions for much of the data set, has a signifi-
cant bias towards making majority class decisions, re-
lying more on prior assumptions about the frequency
distribution of the classes than on antecedent features
when handling examples of less frequent classes. In
order to create a system that can be trained to rely
more explicitly on antecedent information, we cre-
ated a neural network classifier for our task. The intro-
duction of a hidden layer should enable the classifier
to learn abstract concepts such as gender and number
that are useful across multiple output categories, so
that the performance of sparsely represented classes
can benefit from the training examples of the more
frequent classes.

The overall structure of the network is shown in
Figure 3. As inputs, the network takes the same fea-
tures that were available to the baseline ME classifier,
based on the source pronoun (P) with three words
of context to its left (L1 to L3) and three words to
its right (R1 to R3) as well as the words aligned to
the syntactic head words of all possible antecedent
candidates as found by BART (A). All words are

encoded as one-hot vectors whose dimensionality is
equal to the vocabulary size. If multiple words are
aligned to the syntactic head of an antecedent candi-
date, their word vectors are averaged with uniform
weights. The resulting vectors for each antecedent
are then averaged with weights defined by the pos-
terior distribution of the anaphora resolver in BART
(p1 to p3).

The network has two hidden layers. The first layer
(E) maps the input word vectors to a low-dimensional
representation. In this layer, the embedding weights
for all the source language vectors (the pronoun
and its 6 context words) are tied, so if two words
are the same, they are mapped to the same lower-
dimensional embedding irrespective of their position
relative to the pronoun. The embedding of the an-
tecedent word vectors is independent, as these word
vectors represent target language words. The entire
embedding layer is then mapped to another hidden
layer (H), which is in turn connected to a softmax out-
put layer (S) with 6 outputs representing the classes
ce, elle, elles, il, ils and OTHER. The non-linearity of
both hidden layers is the logistic sigmoid function,
f (x) = 1/(1+ e−x).

In all experiments reported in this paper, the dimen-
sionality of the source and target language word em-
beddings is 20, resulting in a total embedding layer
size of 160, and the size of the last hidden layer is
equal to 50. These sizes are fairly small. In experi-
ments with larger layer sizes, we were able to obtain
similar, but no better results.

384



The neural network is trained with mini-batch
stochastic gradient descent with backpropagated gra-
dients using the RMSPROP algorithm with cross-
entropy as the objective function.3 In contrast to
standard gradient descent, RMSPROP normalises the
magnitude of the gradient components by dividing
them by a root-mean-square moving average. We
found this led to faster convergence. Other features
of our training algorithm include the use of momen-
tum to even out gradient oscillations, adaptive learn-
ing rates for each weight as well as adaptation of
the global learning rate as a function of current train-
ing progress. The network is regularised with an `2
weight penalty. Good settings of the initial learning
rate and the weight cost parameter (both around 0.001
in most experiments) were found by manual experi-
mentation. Generally, we train our networks for 300
epochs, compute the validation error on a held-out
set of some 10 % of the training data after each epoch
and use the model that achieved the lowest validation
error for testing.

Since the source context features are very infor-
mative and it is comparatively more difficult to learn
from the antecedents, the network sometimes had a
tendency to overfit to the source features and disre-
gard antecedent information. We found that this prob-
lem can be solved effectively by presenting a part of
the training without any source features, forcing the
network to learn from the information contained in
the antecedents. In all experiments in this paper, we
zero out all source features (input layers P, L1 to L3
and R1 to R3) with a probability of 50 % in each
training example. At test time, no information is ze-
roed out.

Classification results with this network are shown
in Table 3. We note that the accuracy has increased
slightly for the TED test set and remains exactly the
same for the news commentary corpus. However, a
closer look on the results for individual classes re-
veals that the neural network makes better predictions
for almost all classes. In terms of F-score, the only
class that becomes slightly worse is the OTHER class
for the news commentary corpus because of lower
recall, indicating that the neural network classifier is
less biased towards using the uninformative OTHER

line lectures held by Geoffrey Hinton in 2012 (https://www.
coursera.org/course/neuralnets, 10 September 2013).

category. Recall for elle and elles increases consider-
ably, but especially for elles it is still quite low. The
increase in recall comes with some loss in precision,
but the net effect on F-score is clearly positive.

6 Latent Anaphora Resolution

Considering Figure 1 again, we note that the bilin-
gual setting of our classification task adds some in-
formation not available to the monolingual anaphora
resolver that can be helpful when determining the
correct antecedent for a given pronoun. Knowing the
gender of the translation of a pronoun limits the set
of possible antecedents to those whose translation is
morphologically compatible with the target language
pronoun. We can exploit this fact to learn how to
resolve anaphoric pronouns without requiring data
with manually annotated anaphoric links.

To achieve this, we extend our neural network with
a component to predict the probability of each an-
tecedent candidate to be the correct antecedent (Fig-
ure 4). The extended network is identical to the previ-
ous version except for the upper left part dealing with
anaphoric link features. The only difference between
the two networks is the fact that anaphora resolution
is now performed by a part of our neural network
itself instead of being done by an external module
and provided to the classifier as an input.

In this setup, we still use some parts of the BART
toolkit to extract markables and compute features.
However, we do not make use of the machine learn-
ing component in BART that makes the actual pre-
dictions. Since this is the only component trained on
coreference-annotated data in a typical BART con-
figuration, no coreference annotations are used any-
where in our system even though we continue to rely
on the external anaphora resolver for preprocessing
to avoid implementing our own markable and feature
extractors and to make comparison easier.

For each candidate markable identified by BART’s
preprocessing pipeline, the anaphora resolution
model receives as input a link feature vector (T) de-
scribing relevant aspects of the antecedent candidate-
anaphora pair. This feature vector is generated by the
feature extraction machinery in BART and includes
a standard feature set for coreference resolution par-
tially based on work by Soon et al. (2001). We use
the following feature extractors in BART, each of

– Anaphora mention type
– Gender match

– String match
– Alias feature (Soon et al., 2001)
– Appositive position feature (Soon et al., 2001)
– Semantic class (Soon et al., 2001)
– Semantic class match
– Binary distance feature
– Antecedent is first mention in sentence

Our baseline set of features was borrowed whole-
sale from a working coreference system and includes
some features that are not relevant to the task at hand,
e. g., features indicating that the anaphora is a pro-
noun, is not a named entity, etc. After removing all
features that assume constant values in the training
set when resolving antecedents for the set of pro-
nouns we consider, we are left with a basic set of 37
anaphoric link features that are fed as inputs to our
network. These features are exactly the same as those
available to the anaphora resolution classifier in the
BART system used in the previous section.

Each training example for our network can have
an arbitrary number of antecedent candidates, each of
which is described by an antecedent word vector (A)
and by an anaphoric link vector (T). The anaphoric
link features are first mapped to a regular hidden layer
with logistic sigmoid units (U). The activations of the
hidden units are then mapped to a single value, which

functions as an element in a softmax layer over all an-
tecedent candidates (V). This softmax layer assigns
a probability to each antecedent candidate, which we
then use to compute a weighted average over the an-
tecedent word vector, replacing the probabilities pi
in Figures 2 and 3.

At training time, the network’s anaphora resolu-
tion component is trained in exactly the same way as
the rest of the network. The error signal from the em-
bedding layer is backpropagated both to the weight
matrix defining the antecedent word embedding and
to the anaphora resolution subnetwork. Note that the
number of weights in the network is the same for
all training examples even though the number of an-
tecedent candidates varies because all weights related
to antecedent word features and anaphoric link fea-
tures are shared between all antecedent candidates.

One slightly uncommon feature of our neural net-
work is that it contains an internal softmax layer to
generate normalised probabilities over all possible
antecedent candidates. Moreover, weights are shared
between all antecedent candidates, so the inputs of
our internal softmax layer share dependencies on
the same weight variables. When computing deriva-
tives with backpropagation, these shared dependen-
cies must be taken into account. In particular, the
outputs yi of the antecedent resolution layer are the re-
sult of a softmax applied to functions of some shared
variables q:

yi =
exp fi(q)

∑k exp fk(q)
(1)

386



The derivatives of any yi with respect to q, which
can be any of the weights in the anaphora resolution
subnetwork, have dependencies on the derivatives of
the other softmax inputs with respect to q:

∂q

= yi

(2)

This makes the implementation of backpropagation
for this part of the network somewhat more compli-
cated, but in the case of our networks, it has no major
impact on training time.

Experimental results for this network are shown
in Table 4. Compared with Table 3, we note that the
overall accuracy is only very slightly lower for TED,
and for the news commentaries it is actually better.
When it comes to F-scores, the performance for elles
improves by a small amount, while the effect on the
other classes is a bit more mixed. Even where it gets
worse, the differences are not dramatic considering
that we eliminated a very knowledge-rich resource
from the training process. This demonstrates that it
is possible, in our classification task, to obtain good
results without using any data manually annotated for
anaphora and to rely entirely on unsupervised latent
anaphora resolution.

7 Further Improvements

The results presented in the preceding section repre-
sent a clear improvement over the ME classifiers in
Table 2, even though the overall accuracy increased
only slightly. Not only does our neural network clas-
sifier achieve better results on the classification task
at hand without requiring an anaphora resolution clas-
sifier trained on manually annotated data, but it per-
forms clearly better for the feminine categories that
reflect minority choices requiring knowledge about
the antecedents. Nevertheless, the performance is still
not entirely satisfactory.

By subjecting the output of our classifier on a de-
velopment set to a manual error analysis, we found
that a fairly large number of errors belong to two error
types: On the one hand, the preprocessing pipeline
used to identify antecedent candidates does not al-
ways include the correct antecedent in the set pre-
sented to the neural network. Whenever this occurs,
it is obvious that the classifier cannot possibly find

the correct antecedent. Out of 76 examples of the cat-
egory elles that had been mistakenly predicted as ils,
we found that 43 suffered from this problem. In other
classes, the problem seems to be somewhat less com-
mon, but it still exists. On the other hand, in many
cases (23 out of 76 for the category mentioned be-
fore) the anaphora resolution subnetwork does iden-
tify an antecedent manually recognised to belong to
the right gender/number group, but still predicts an in-
correct pronoun. This may indicate that the network
has difficulties learning a correct gender/number rep-
resentation for all words in the vocabulary.

7.1 Relaxing Markable Extraction

The pipeline we use to extract potential antecedent
candidates is borrowed from the BART anaphora
resolution toolkit. BART uses a syntactic parser to
identify noun phrases as markables. When extract-
ing antecedent candidates for coreference prediction,
it starts by considering a window consisting of the
sentence in which the anaphoric pronoun is located
and the two immediately preceding sentences. Mark-
ables in this window are checked for morphological
compatibility in terms of gender and number with the
anaphoric pronoun, and only compatible markables
are extracted as antecedent candidates. If no compat-
ible markables are found in the initial window, the
window is successively enlarged one sentence at a
time until at least one suitable markable is found.

Our error analysis shows that this procedure
misses some relevant markables both because the ini-
tial two-sentence extraction window is too small and
because the morphological compatibility check incor-
rectly filters away some markables that should have
been considered as candidates. By contrast, the ex-
traction procedure does extract quite a number of first
and second person noun phrases (I, we, you and their
oblique forms) in the TED talks which are extremely
unlikely to be the antecedent of a later occurrence of
he, she, it or they. As a first step, we therefore adjust
the extraction criteria to our task by increasing the
initial extraction window to five sentences, exclud-
ing first and second person markables and removing
the morphological compatibility requirement. The
compatibility check is still used to control expansion
of the extraction window, but it is no longer applied

commentaries, while the performance for elles im-
proves to F-scores of 0.531 (TED; P 0.690, R 0.432)
and 0.304 (News commentaries; P 0.444, R 0.231),
respectively. Note that these and all the following re-
sults are not directly comparable to the ME baseline
results in Table 2, since they include modifications
and improvements to the training data extraction pro-
cedure that might possibly lead to benefits in the ME
setting as well.

7.2 Adding Lexicon Knowledge
In order to make it easier for the classifier to iden-
tify the gender and number properties of infrequent
words, we extend the word vectors with features indi-
cating possible morphological features for each word.
In early experiments with ME classifiers, we found
that our attempts to do proper gender and number
tagging in French text did not improve classification
performance noticeably, presumably because the an-
notation was too noisy. In more recent experiments,
we just add features indicating all possible morpho-
logical interpretations of each word, rather than try-
ing to disambiguate them. To do this, we look up
the morphological annotations of the French words
in the Lefff dictionary (Sagot et al., 2006) and intro-

duce a set of new binary features to indicate whether
a particular reading of a word occurs in that dictio-
nary. These features are then added to the one-hot
representation of the antecedent words. Doing so im-
proves the classifier accuracy to 0.711 (TED) and
0.604 (News commentaries), while the F-scores for
elles reach 0.589 (TED; P 0.649, R 0.539) and 0.500
(News commentaries; P 0.545, R 0.462), respectively.

7.3 More Anaphoric Link Features
Even though the modified antecedent candidate ex-
traction with its larger context window and without
the morphological filter results in better performance
on both test sets, additional error analysis reveals
that the classifiers has greater problems identifying
the correct markable in this setting. One reason for
this may be that the baseline anaphoric link feature
set described above (Section 6) only includes two
very rough binary distance features which indicate
whether or not the anaphora and the antecedent can-
didate occur in the same or in immediately adjacent
sentences. With the larger context window, this may
be too unspecific. In our final experiment, we there-
fore enable some additional features which are avail-
able in BART, but disabled in the baseline system:

388



– Distance in number of markables
– Distance in number of sentences
– Sentence distance, log-transformed
– Distance in number of words
– Part of speech of head word

Most of these encode the distance between the
anaphora and the antecedent candidate in more pre-
cise ways. Complete results for this final system are
presented in Table 5.

Including these additional features leads to another
slight increase in accuracy for both corpora, with sim-
ilar or increased classifier F-scores for most classes
except elle in the news commentary condition. In par-
ticular, we should like to point out the performance
of our benchmark classifier for elles, which suffered
from extremely low recall in the first classifiers and
approaches the performance of the other classes, with
nearly balanced precision and recall, in this final sys-
tem. Since elles is a low-frequency class and cannot
be reliably predicted using source context alone, we
interpret this as evidence that our final neural network
classifier has incorporated some relevant knowledge
about pronominal anaphora that the baseline ME clas-
sifier and earlier versions of our network have no ac-
cess to. This is particularly remarkable because no
data manually annotated for coreference was used for
training.

8 Related work

Even though it was recognised years ago that the
information contained in parallel corpora may pro-
vide valuable information for the improvement of
anaphora resolution systems, there have not been
many attempts to cash in on this insight. Mitkov and
Barbu (2003) exploit parallel data in English and
French to improve pronominal anaphora resolution
by combining anaphora resolvers for the individual
languages with handwritten rules to resolve conflicts
between the output of the language-specific resolvers.
Veselovská et al. (2012) apply a similar strategy to
English-Czech data to resolve different uses of the
pronoun it. Other work has used word alignments to
project coreference annotations from one language
to another with a view to training anaphora resolvers
in the target language (Postolache et al., 2006; de
Souza and Orăsan, 2011). Rahman and Ng (2012)
instead use machine translation to translate their test

data into a language for which they have an anaphora
resolver and then project the annotations back to the
original language. Completely unsupervised mono-
lingual anaphora resolution has been approached us-
ing, e. g., Markov logic (Poon and Domingos, 2008)
and the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm (Cherry
and Bergsma, 2005; Charniak and Elsner, 2009). To
the best of our knowledge, the direct application of
machine learning techniques to parallel data in a task
related to anaphora resolution is novel in our work.

Neural networks and deep learning techniques
have recently gained some popularity in natural lan-
guage processing. They have been applied to tasks
such as language modelling (Bengio et al., 2003;
Schwenk, 2007), translation modelling in statistical
machine translation (Le et al., 2012), but also part-of-
speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition
and semantic role labelling (Collobert et al., 2011).
In tasks related to anaphora resolution, standard feed-
forward neural networks have been tested as a clas-
sifier in an anaphora resolution system (Stuckardt,
2007), but the network design presented in our work
is novel.

9 Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced cross-lingual pro-
noun prediction as an independent natural language
processing task. Even though it is not an end-to-end
task, pronoun prediction is interesting for several rea-
sons. It is related to the problem of pronoun transla-
tion in SMT, a currently unsolved problem that has
been addressed in a number of recent research publi-
cations (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Hardmeier and
Federico, 2010; Guillou, 2012) without reaching a
major breakthrough. In this work, we have shown that
pronoun prediction can be effectively modelled in a
neural network architecture with relatively simple
features. More importantly, we have demonstrated
that the task can be exploited to train a classifier with
a latent representation of anaphoric links. With paral-
lel text as its only supervision this classifier achieves
a level of performance that is similar to, if not bet-
ter than, that of a classifier using a regular anaphora
resolution system trained with manually annotated
data.
