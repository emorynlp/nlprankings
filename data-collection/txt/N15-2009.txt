Abstract

The well related tasks of evaluating the Se-
mantic Textual Similarity and Semantic Relat-
edness have been under a special attention in
NLP community. Many different approaches
have been proposed, implemented and evalu-
ated at different levels, such as lexical similar-
ity, word/string/POS tags overlapping, seman-
tic modeling (LSA, LDA), etc. However, at
the level of syntactic structure, it is not clear
how significant it contributes to the overall ac-
curacy. In this paper, we make a preliminary
evaluation of the impact of the syntactic struc-
ture in the tasks by running and analyzing the
results from several experiments regarding to
how syntactic structure contributes to solving
these tasks.

1 Introduction

Since the introduction of Semantic Textual Simi-
larity (STS) task at SemEval 2012 and the Seman-
tic Relatedness (SR) task at SemEval 2014, a large
number of participating systems have been devel-
oped to resolve the tasks.1,2 The systems must quan-
tifiably identify the degree of similarity, relatedness,
respectively, for pair of short pieces of text, like sen-
tences, where the similarity or relatedness is a broad
concept and its value is normally obtained by aver-
aging the opinion of several annotators. A semantic
similarity/relatedness score is usually a real number
in a semantic scale, [0-5] in STS, or [1-5] in SR, in

1http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2012/task6
2http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1

the direction from no relevance to semantic equiva-
lence. Some examples from the dataset MSRpar of
STS 2012 with associated similarity scores (by hu-
man judgment) are as below:

• The bird is bathing in the sink. vs. Birdie is
washing itself in the water basin. (score = 5.0)

• Shares in EDS closed on Thursday at $18.51,
a gain of 6 cents. vs. Shares of EDS closed
Thursday at $18.51, up 6 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange. (score = 3.667)

• Vivendi shares closed 3.8 percent up in Paris at
15.78 euros. vs. Vivendi shares were 0.3 per-
cent up at 15.62 euros in Paris at 0841 GMT.
(score = 2.6)

• John went horse back riding at dawn with a
whole group of friends. vs. Sunrise at dawn
is a magnificent view to take in if you wake up
early enough for it. (score = 0)

From our reading of the literature (Marelli et al.,
2014b; Agirre et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2013; Agir-
rea et al., 2014), most of STS/SR systems rely on
pairwise similarity, such as lexical similarity using
taxonomies (WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)) or distri-
butional semantic models (LDA (Blei et al., 2003),
LSA (Landauer et al., 1998), ESA (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007), etc), and word/n-grams overlap
as main features to train a support vector machines
(Joachims, 1998) regression model (supervised), or
use a word-alignment metric (unsupervised) align-
ing the two given texts to compute their semantic
similarity.

Intuitively, the syntactic structure plays an impor-
tant role for human being to understand the mean-

64



ing of a given text. Thus, it also may help to iden-
tify the semantic equivalence/relatedness between
two given texts. However, in the STS/SR tasks,
very few systems provide evidence of the contribu-
tion of syntactic structure in its overall performance.
Some systems report partially on this issue, for ex-
ample, iKernels (Severyn et al., 2013) carried out
an analysis on the STS 2012, but not on STS 2013
datasets. They found that syntactic structure con-
tributes 0.0271 and 0.0281 points more to the over-
all performance, from 0.8187 to 0.8458 and 0.8468,
for adopting constituency and dependency trees, re-
spectively.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of syntac-
tic structure on the STS 2014 and SICK datasets
of STS/SR tasks. We consider three systems which
are reported to perform efficiently and effectively on
processing syntactic trees using three proposed ap-
proaches Syntactic Tree Kernel (Moschitti, 2006),
Syntactic Generalization (Galitsky, 2013) and Dis-
tributed Tree Kernel (Zanzotto and Dell’Arciprete,
2012).

The remainder of the paper is as follows: Section
2 introduces three approaches to exploit the syntac-
tic structure in STS/SR tasks, Section 3 describes
Experimental Settings, Section 4 discusses about the
Evaluations and Section 5 is the Conclusions and
Future Work.

2 Three Approaches for Exploiting the
Syntactic Structure

In this section, we describe three different ap-
proaches exploiting the syntactic structure to be
used in the STS/SR tasks, which are Syntactic Tree
Kernel (Moschitti, 2006), Syntactic Generaliza-
tion (Galitsky, 2013), and Distributed Tree Ker-
nel (Zanzotto and Dell’Arciprete, 2012). All these
three approaches learn the syntactic information ei-
ther from the dependency parse trees produced by
the Stanford Parser (standard PCFG Parser) (Klein
and Manning, 2003) or constituency parse trees ob-
tained by OpenNLP.3 The output of each approach
is normalized to the standard semantic scale of STS
[0-5] or SR [1-5] tasks to evaluate its standalone per-
formance, or combined with other features in our
baseline system for assessing its contribution to the

3https://opennlp.apache.org

overall accuracy by using the same WEKA machine
learning tool (Hall et al., 2009) with as same config-
urations and parameters as our baseline systems.

2.1 Syntactic Tree Kernel (STK)

Given two trees T1 and T2, the functionality of tree
kernels is to compare two tree structures by comput-
ing the number of common substructures between
T1 and T2 without explicitly considering the whole
fragment space. According to the literature (Mos-
chitti, 2006), there are three types of fragments de-
scribed as the subtrees (STs), the subset trees (SSTs)
and the partial trees (PTs). A subtree (ST) is a node
and all its children, but terminals are not STs. A
subset tree (SST) is a more general structure since
its leaves need not be terminals. The SSTs satisfy
the constraint that grammatical rules cannot be bro-
ken. When this constraint is relaxed, a more general
form of substructures is obtained and defined as par-
tial trees (PTs).

Syntactic Tree Kernel (STK) (Moschitti, 2006) is
a tree kernels approach to learn the syntactic struc-
ture from syntactic parsing information, particularly,
the Partial Tree (PT) kernel is proposed as a new
convolution kernel to fully exploit dependency trees.
The evaluation of the common PTs rooted in nodes
n1 and n2 requires the selection of the shared child
subsets of the two nodes, e.g. [S [DT JJ N]] and [S
[DT N N]] have [S [N]] (2 times) and [S [DT N]] in
common.

In order to learn the similarity of syntactic struc-
ture, we seek for a corpus which should fulfill the
two requirements, (1) sentence-pairs contain simi-
lar syntactic structure, and with (2) a variety of their
syntactic structure representations (in their parsing
trees). However, neither SICK nor STS corpus
seems to be suitable. As the SICK corpus is de-
signed for evaluating compositional distributional
semantic models through semantic relatedness and
textual entailment, the syntactic structure of sen-
tence pairs are quite simple and straightforward. In
contrast, the STS corpus contains several different
datasets derived from different sources (see Table 1)
which carry a large variety of syntactic structure rep-
resentations, but lack of learning examples due to no
human annotation given for syntactic structure sim-
ilarity (only annotation for semantic similarity ex-
ists); and it is difficult to infer the syntactic structure

65



similarity from general semantic similarity scores
in STS datasets. Hence, having assumed that para-
phrased pairs would share the same content and sim-
ilar syntactic structures, we decide to choose the Mi-
crosoft Research Paraphrasing Corpus (Dolan et al.,
2005) which contains 5,800 sentence pairs extracted
from news sources on the web, along with human
annotations indicating whether each pair captures a
paraphrase/semantic equivalence relationship.4 This
corpus is split into Training set (4,076 pairs) and
Testing set (1,725 pairs).

We use Stanford Parser (PCFG Parser) trained on
Penn TreeBank (Klein and Manning, 2003) to obtain
the dependency parsing from sentence pairs. Then
we use the machine learning tool svm-light-tk 1.2
which uses Tree Kernel approach to learn the sim-
ilarity of syntactic structure to build a binary clas-
sifying model on the Train dataset.5 According to
the assumption above, we label paraphrased pairs
as 1, -1 otherwise. We test this model on the Test
dataset and obtain the Accuracy of 69.16%, with
Precision/Recall is: 69.04%/97.21%.

We apply this model on the STS and SICK data
to predict the similarity between sentence pairs. The
output predictions are probability confidence scores
in [-1,1], corresponds to the probability of the la-
bel to be positive. Thus, we convert the prediction
value into the semantic scale of STS and SR tasks to
compare to the human annotation. The example data
(including train, test, and predictions) of this tool is
available here.6

2.2 Syntactic Generalization (SG)

Given a pair of parse trees, the Syntactic General-
ization (SG) (Galitsky, 2013) finds a set of maxi-
mal common subtrees. Though generalization oper-
ation is a formal operation on abstract trees, it yields
semantics information from commonalities between
sentences. Instead of only extracting common key-
words from two sentences, the generalization op-
eration produces a syntactic expression. This ex-
pression maybe semantically interpreted as a com-
mon meaning held by both sentences. This syntactic
parse tree generalization learns the semantic infor-

20cd-47e3-85bc-a2f65cd28042

5http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/SIGIR-tutorial.htm
6http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm

mation differently from the kernel methods which
compute a kernel function between data instances,
whereas a kernel function is considered as a similar-
ity measure. Other than the kernel methods, SG is
considered as structure-based and deterministic, in
which linguistic features remain their structure, not
as value presentations.

The toolkit "relevance-based-on-parse-trees" is an
open-source project which evaluates text relevance
by using syntactic parse tree-based similarity mea-
sure.7 Given a pair of parse trees, it measures the
similarity between two sentences by finding a set of
maximal common subtrees, using representation of
constituency parse trees via chunking. Each type of
phrases (NP, VP, PRP etc.) will be aligned and sub-
ject to generalization. It uses the OpenNLP system
to derive dependency trees for generalization (chun-
ker and parser).8 This tool is made to give as a
tool for text relevance which can be used as a black
box, no understanding of computational linguistics
or machine learning is required. We apply the tool
on the SICK and STS datasets to compute the sim-
ilarity of syntactic structure of sentence pairs. The
similarity score from this tool is converted into the
semantic scale of STS and SR tasks for comparison
against the human annotation.

2.3 Distributed Tree Kernel (DTK)
Distributed Tree Kernel (DTK) (Zanzotto and
Dell’Arciprete, 2012) is a tree kernels method using
a linear complexity algorithm to compute vectors for
trees by embedding feature spaces of tree fragments
in low-dimensional spaces. Then a recursive algo-
rithm is proposed with linear complexity to compute
reduced vectors for trees. The dot product among
reduced vectors is used to approximate the original
tree kernel when a vector composition function with
specific ideal properties is used.

Firstly, we use Stanford Parser (PCFG Parser)
trained on Penn TreeBank (Klein and Manning,
2003) to obtain the dependency parsing of sen-
tences, and feed them to the software "distributed-
tree-kernels" to produce the distributed trees.9 Then,
we compute the Cosine similarity between the vec-
tors of distributed trees of each sentence pair. This

cosine similarity score is converted to the scale of
STS and SR for evaluation.

3 Experiments

In this section, we describe the two corpora we use
for experiments with several different settings to
evaluate the contribution of each syntactic structure
approach and in combination with other features in
our baseline systems.

3.1 Datasets

We run our experiments on two datasets from two
different tasks at SemEval 2014 as follows:

• The SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014a) is used
in Task# 1 "Evaluation of compositional dis-
tributional semantic models on full sentences
through semantic relatedness and textual entail-
ment".10 It consists of 10,000 English sentence
pairs, built from two paraphrase sets: the 8K
ImageFlickr dataset and the STS 2012 Video
Descriptions dataset.11,12 Each sentence pair
was annotated for relatedness score in scale [1-
5] and entailment relation. It is split into three
parts: Trial (500 pairs), Training (4,500 pairs)
and Testing (4,927 pairs).

• The STS dataset is used in Task #10 "Mul-
tilingual Semantic Textual Similarity" (STS
English subtask) which consists of several
datasets in STS 2012 (Agirre et al., 2012), 2013
(Agirre et al., 2013) and 2014 (Agirrea et al.,
2014). Each sentence pair is annotated the se-
mantic similarity score in the scale [0-5]. Ta-
ble 1 shows the summary of STS datasets and
sources over the years. For training, we use all
data in STS 2012 and 2013; and for evaluation,
we use STS 2014 datasets.

3.2 Baselines

In order to evaluate the significance of syntactic
structure in the STS/SR tasks, we not only exam-
ine the syntactic structure alone, but also combine

it with some features learned from common ap-
proaches, such as bag-of-words, pairwise similarity,
n-grams overlap, etc. Therefore, we use two base-
line systems for evaluations, the weak and the strong
ones. The weak baseline is the basic one used for
evaluation in all the STS tasks, namely tokencos.
It uses the bag-of-words approach which represents
each sentence as a vector in the multidimensional
token space (each dimension has 1 if the token is
present in the sentence, 0 otherwise) and computes
the cosine similarity between vectors.

Besides the weak baseline, we use DKPro Simi-
larity (Bär et al., 2012) as a strong baseline which
is an open source software and intended to use as
a baseline-system in the share task STS at *SEM
2013.13 It uses a simple log-linear regression model
(about 18 features), to combine multiple text simi-
larity measures of varying complexity ranging from
simple character/word n-grams and common subse-
quences to complex features such as Explicit Se-
mantic Analysis vector comparisons and aggrega-
tion of word similarity based on lexical-semantic re-
sources (WordNet and Wiktionary).14,15

cal similarity features to the overall performance of
computing similarity/relatedness score on SICK and
STS datasets. The results reported here are obtained
with Pearson correlation, which is the official mea-
sure used in both tasks.16 We have some discussions
from the results in Table 2 as below:

Baseline comparison. The strong baseline
DKPro is superior than the bag-of-word baseline on
most of datasets (both STS and SICK), except the
tweet-news where their performances are close as
the tweet-news dataset contains little or no syntac-
tic information compared to others.

Individual approach evaluation. Each syntactic
approach is weaker than both baselines. Though the
STK and DTK both use the tree kernel approach,
just different representations, the performance is
similar only on the dataset images. The STK still
performs better than DTK on most of STS datasets,
but much lower on SICK dataset. This is reason-
able as the SICK dataset is created for evaluating
distributional semantics which suits the DTK ap-
proach. Both approaches have some negative results
on STS datasets; especially, both methods obtain
negative correlation on two datasets "images" and
"tweet-news". It seems that both methods struggle to
learn the semantic information (in parsing) extracted

16http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-
moment_correlation_coefficient

from these two datasets. Moreover, due to the fact
that Twitter data is informal text which carries lot
of noise created by users, and very different from
formal text from other STS datasets, the syntactic
approach does not seem to capture correct meaning,
thus, the result confirms that syntactic approach is
not suitable and beneficial for social media text.

In contrast, the SG performs better than other two
approaches to obtain better correlation with human
judgment; yet it is still below the bag-of-word base-
line (only better on OnWN dataset). Hence, using
any of these syntactic approaches is not sufficient
to solve the STS/SR task as its performance is still
lower than the weak baseline. Some examples with
gold-standard and system scores as below:

• Blue and red plane in mid-air flight. vs. A blue
and red airplane while in flight. (gold=4.8;
STK=3.418; DTK=3.177; SG=3.587)

• Global online #education is a key to democra-
tizing access to learning and overcoming soci-
etal ills such as poverty vs. Op-Ed Columnist:
Revolution Hits the Universities (gold=0.6;
STK=3.054; DTK=3.431; SG=2.074)

• you are an #inspiration! #Keepfighting vs.
The front lines in fight for women (gold=0.4;
STK=3.372; DTK=3.479; SG=2.072)

• CGG - 30 die when bus plunges off cliff in
Nepal vs. 30 killed as bus plunges off cliff

68



in Nepal (gold=5; STK=3.155; DTK=3.431;
SG=3.402)

The combination of three approaches. These
three methods do not collaborate well on STS
datasets, it even decreases the overall performance
of the best method SG by a large margin of 8%.
However, it improves the result on SICK dataset by
a medium margin around 4%. Finally, the combi-
nation of three methods still returns a lower result
than the weak baseline. Thus, this combination of
syntactic approaches alone cannot solve the STS/SR
tasks.

Combination with bag-of-word approach. The
combination of syntactic information and bag-of-
word approach more or less improves the perfor-
mance over the weak baseline.

• The STK does not improve but has negative im-
pact to the overall performance on STS with a
decrease of 4%. However, it gains a small im-
provement on SICK of 1%.

• Though the DTK returns 3.5% better result
than STK on STS and slightly improves the
performance on SICK for less than 1%, it is
0.5% lower than the weak baseline.

• The SG improves the performance 2-12% on
most of STS and SICK datasets. It performs 4-
8% better than the weak baseline, but still dra-
matically 11-14% lower than the DKPro base-
line.

• The combination of three methods with the
bag-of-word results 3-8% better performance
than the weak baseline on STS/SICK datasets.
However, this combination brings negative ef-
fect of 0.5% to the overall result on STS in
comparison to the performance of SG.

Combination with DKPro. Perhaps DKPro
baseline consists of several strong features which
make syntactic features insignificant in the combi-
nation. Hence, using a strong baseline like DKPro is
not a good way to evaluate the significance of syn-
tactic information.

• The STK gains small improvement on SICK
(3%) and some STS datasets (1%), whereas
other datasets remain unchanged.

• The DTK does not have any effect to the result
of DKPro standalone. This shows that DTK has
no integration with DKPro features.

• The SG only makes slight improvement on
SICK (0.2%) and deft-forum (1%), whereas lit-
tle decrease on other datasets. This shows that
SG does not collaborate well with DKPro ei-
ther.

• On STS, this total combination returns few
small improvements around 1% on some
datasets deft-forum, headlines, tweet-news and
mean value, whereas 1-3% better on SICK
dataset.

In conclusion, despite the fact that we experiment
different methods to exploit syntactic information on
different datasets derived from various data sources,
the results in Table 2 confirms the positive impact
of syntactic structure in the overall performance on
STS/SR tasks. However, syntactic structure does not
always work well and effectively on any dataset, it
requires a certain level of syntactic presentation in
the corpus to exploit. In some cases, applying syn-
tactic structure on poor-structured data may cause
negative effect to the overall performance.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we deploy three different approaches
to exploit and evaluate the impact of syntactic struc-
ture in the STS/SR tasks. We use a freely avail-
able STS system, DKPro, which is using simi-
larity features for computing the semantic similar-
ity/relatedness scores as a strong baseline. We also
evaluate the contribution of each syntactic structure
approach and different combinations between them
and the typical similarity approach in the baseline.
From our observation, in the mean time with recent
proposed approaches, the results in Table 2 shows
that the syntactic structure does contribute individu-
ally and together with typical similarity approaches
for computing the semantic similarity/relatedness
scores between given sentence pairs. However, com-
pared to the baselines, the contribution of syntac-
tic structure is not significant to the overall perfor-
mance. For future work, we may expect to see more
effective ways for exploiting and learning syntactic
structure to have better contribution into the overall
performance in the STS/SR tasks.
