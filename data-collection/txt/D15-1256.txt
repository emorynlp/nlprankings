Abstract

Twitter is often used in quantitative stud-
ies that identify geographically-preferred
topics, writing styles, and entities. These
studies rely on either GPS coordinates at-
tached to individual messages, or on the
user-supplied location field in each profile.
In this paper, we compare these data ac-
quisition techniques and quantify the bi-
ases that they introduce; we also measure
their effects on linguistic analysis and text-
based geolocation. GPS-tagging and self-
reported locations yield measurably dif-
ferent corpora, and these linguistic differ-
ences are partially attributable to differ-
ences in dataset composition by age and
gender. Using a latent variable model
to induce age and gender, we show how
these demographic variables interact with
geography to affect language use. We
also show that the accuracy of text-based
geolocation varies with population demo-
graphics, giving the best results for men
above the age of 40.

1 Introduction

Social media data such as Twitter is frequently
used to identify the unique characteristics of
geographical regions, including topics of inter-
est (Hong et al., 2012), linguistic styles and di-
alects (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Gonçalves and
Sánchez, 2014), political opinions (Caldarelli et
al., 2014), and public health (Broniatowski et al.,
2013). Social media permits the aggregation of
datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than
could be assembled via traditional survey tech-
niques, enabling analysis that is simultaneously
fine-grained and global in scale. Yet social media
is not a representative sample of any “real world”
population, aside from social media itself. Using

social media as a sample therefore risks introduc-
ing both geographic and demographic biases (Mis-
love et al., 2011; Hecht and Stephens, 2014; Lon-
gley et al., 2015; Malik et al., 2015).

This paper examines the effects of these bi-
ases on the geo-linguistic inferences that can be
drawn from Twitter. We focus on the ten largest
metropolitan areas in the United States, and con-
sider three sampling techniques: drawing an equal
number of GPS-tagged tweets from each area;
drawing a county-balanced sample of GPS-tagged
messages to correct Twitter’s urban skew (Hecht
and Stephens, 2014); and drawing a sample of
location-annotated messages, using the location
field in the user profile. Leveraging self-reported
first names and census statistics, we show that the
age and gender composition of these datasets dif-
fer significantly.

Next, we apply standard methods from the lit-
erature to identify geo-linguistic differences, and
test how the outcomes of these methods depend
on the sampling technique and on the underlying
demographics. We also test the accuracy of text-
based geolocation (Cheng et al., 2010; Eisenstein
et al., 2010) in each dataset, to determine whether
the accuracies reported in recent work will gener-
alize to more balanced samples.

The paper reports several new findings about
geotagged Twitter data:

• In comparison with tweets with self-reported
locations, GPS-tagged tweets are written
more often by young people and by women.
• There are corresponding linguistic dif-

ferences between these datasets, with
GPS-tagged tweets including more
geographically-specific non-standard words.
• Young people use significantly more

geographically-specific non-standard words.
Men tend to mention more geographically-
specific entities than women, but these

2138



differences are significant only for individu-
als at the age of 30 or older.
• Users who GPS-tag their tweets tend to write

more, making them easier to geolocate. Eval-
uating text-based geolocation on GPS-tagged
tweets probably overestimates its accuracy.
• Text-based geolocation is significantly more

accurate for men and for older people.

These findings should inform future attempts to
generalize from geotagged Twitter data, and may
suggest investigations into the demographic prop-
erties of other social media sites.

We first describe the basic data collection prin-
ciples that hold throughout the paper (§ 2). The
following three sections tackle demographic bi-
ases (§ 3), their linguistic consequences (§ 4), and
the impact on text-based geolocation (§ 5); each
of these sections begins with a discussion of meth-
ods, and then presents results. We then summarize
related work and conclude.

2 Dataset

This study is performed on a dataset of tweets
gathered from Twitter’s streaming API from
February 2014 to January 2015. During an ini-
tial filtering step we removed retweets, repetitions
of previously posted messages which contain the
“retweeted status” metadata or “RT” token which
is widely used among Twitter users to indicate a
retweet. To eliminate spam and automated ac-
counts (Yardi et al., 2009), we removed tweets
containing URLs, user accounts with more than
1000 followers or followees, accounts which have
tweeted more than 5000 messages at the time of
data collection, and the top 10% of accounts based
on number of messages in our dataset. We also re-
moved users who have written more than 10% of
their tweets in any language other than English,
using Twitter’s lang metadata field. Exploration
of code-switching (Solorio and Liu, 2008) and the
role of second-language English speakers (Eleta
and Golbeck, 2014) is left for future work.

We consider the ten largest Metropolitan Sta-
tistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States, listed
in Table 1. MSAs are defined by the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau as geographical regions of high popu-
lation with density organized around a single ur-
ban core; they are not legal administrative divi-
sions. MSAs include outlying areas that may be
substantially less urban than the core itself. For
example, the Atlanta MSA is centered on Fulton

County (1750 people per square mile), but extends
to Haralson County (100 people per square mile),
on the border of Alabama. A per-county analysis
of this data therefore enables us to assess the de-
gree to which Twitter’s skew towards urban areas
biases geo-linguistic analysis.

3 Representativeness of geotagged
Twitter data

We first assess potential biases in sampling tech-
niques for obtaining geotagged Twitter data. In
particular, we compare two possible techniques
for obtaining data: the location field in the user
profile (Poblete et al., 2011; Dredze et al., 2013),
and the GPS coordinates attached to each mes-
sage (Cheng et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010).

3.1 Methods

To build a dataset of GPS-tagged messages, we
extracted the GPS latitude and longitude coordi-
nates reported in the tweet, and used GIS-TOOLS1

reverse geocoding to identify the corresponding
counties. This set of geotagged messages will be
denoted DG. Only 1.24% of messages contain
geo-coordinates, and it is possible that the individ-
uals willing to share their GPS comprise a skewed
population. We therefore also considered the user-
reported location field in the Twitter profile, focus-
ing on the two most widely-used patterns: (1) city
name, (2) city name and two letter state name (e.g.
Chicago and Chicago, IL). Messages that matched
any of the ten largest MSAs were grouped into a
second set, DL.

While the inconsistencies of writing style in
the Twitter location field are well-known (Hecht
et al., 2011), analysis of the intersection between
DG andDL found that the two data sources agreed
the overwhelming majority of the time, suggest-
ing that most self-provided locations are accurate.
Of course, there may be many false negatives —
profiles that we fail to geolocate due to the use of
non-standard toponyms like Pixburgh and ATL. If
so, this would introduce a bias in the population
sample in DL. Such a bias might have linguistic
consequences, with datasets based on the location
field containing less non-standard language over-
all.

3.1.1 Subsampling
The initial samples DG and DL were then resam-
pled to create the following balanced datasets:

GPS-MSA-BALANCED FromDG, we randomly
sampled 25,000 tweets per MSA as the
message-balanced sample, and all the tweets
from 2,500 users per MSA as the user-
balanced sample. Balancing across MSAs
ensures that the largest MSAs do not domi-
nate the linguistic analysis.

GPS-COUNTY-BALANCED We resampled
DG based on county-level population (ob-
tained from the U.S. Census Bureau), and
again obtained message-balanced and user-
balanced samples. These samples are more
geographically representative of the overall
population distribution across each MSA.

LOC-MSA-BALANCED From DL, we randomly
sampled 25,000 tweets per MSA as the
message-balanced sample, and all the tweets
from 2,500 users per MSA as the user-
balanced sample. It is not possible to obtain
county-level geolocations in DL, as exact ge-
ographical coordinates are unavailable.

3.1.2 Age and gender identification
To estimate the distribution of ages and genders
in each sample, we queried statistics from the So-
cial Security Administration, which records the
number of individuals born each year with each
given name. Using this information, we obtained
the probability distribution of age values for each
given name. We then matched the names against
the first token in the name field of each user’s

profile, enabling us to induce approximate distri-
butions over ages and genders. Unlike Facebook
and Google+, Twitter does not have a “real name”
policy, so users are free to give names that are
fake, humorous, etc. We eliminate user accounts
whose names are not sufficiently common in the
social security database (i.e. first names which
are at least 100 times more frequent in Twitter
than in the social security database), thereby omit-
ting 33% of user accounts, and 34% of tweets.
While some individuals will choose names not
typically associated with their gender, we assume
that this will happen with roughly equal probabil-
ity in both directions. So, with these caveats in
mind, we induce the age distribution for the GPS-
MSA-BALANCED sample and the LOC-MSA-
BALANCED sample as,

p(a | name = n) = count(name = n, age = a)∑
a′ count(name = n, age = a′)

(1)

pD(a) ∝
∑
i∈D

p(a | name = ni). (2)

We induce distributions over author gender in
much the same way (Mislove et al., 2011). This
method does not incorporate prior information
about the ages of Twitter users, and thus assigns
too much probability to the extremely young and
old, who are unlikely to use the service. While it
would be easy to design such a prior — for exam-
ple, assigning zero prior probability to users under
the age of five or above the age of 95 — we see
no principled basis for determining these cutoffs.
We therefore focus on the differences between the
estimated pD(a) for each sample D.

3.2 Results

Geographical biases in the GPS Sample We
first assess the differences between the true pop-
ulation distributions over counties, and the per-
tweet and per-user distributions. Because coun-
ties vary widely in their degree of urbanization
and other demographic characteristics, this mea-
sure is a proxy for the representativeness of GPS-
based Twitter samples (county information is not
available for the LOC-MSA-BALANCED sample).
Population distributions for New York and Atlanta
are shown in Figure 1. In Atlanta, Fulton County
is the most populous and most urban, and is over-
represented in both geotagged tweets and user ac-
counts; most of the remaining counties are corre-
spondingly underrepresented. This coheres with
the urban bias noted earlier by Hecht and Stephens
(2014). In New York, Kings County (Brooklyn)
is the most populous, but is underrepresented in
both the number of geotagged tweets and user ac-
counts, at the expense of New York County (Man-
hattan). Manhattan is the commercial and enter-
tainment center of the New York MSA, so resi-
dents of outlying counties may be tweeting from
their jobs or social activities.

To quantify the representativeness of each sam-
ple, we use the L1 distance ||x− y||1 =

∑
c |pc−

tc|, where pc is the proportion of the MSA pop-
ulation residing in county c and tc is the propor-
tion of tweets (Table 1). County boundaries are
determined by states, and their density varies: for
example, the Los Angeles MSA covers only two
counties, while the smaller Atlanta MSA is spread
over 28 counties. The table shows that while New
York is the most extreme example, most MSAs
feature an asymmetry between county population
and Twitter adoption.

Usage Next, we turn to differences between the
GPS-based and profile-based techniques for ob-
taining ground truth data. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, the LOC-MSA-BALANCED sample con-
tains more low-volume users than either the GPS-
MSA-BALANCED or GPS-COUNTY-BALANCED
samples. We can therefore conclude that the
county-level geographical bias in the GPS-based
data does not impact usage rate, but that the differ-
ence between GPS-based and profile-based sam-
pling does; the linguistic consequences of this dif-
ference will be explored in the following sections.

Demographics Table 2 shows the expected age
and gender for each dataset, with bootstrap con-
fidence intervals. Users in the LOC-MSA-
BALANCED dataset are on average two years older
than in the GPS-MSA-BALANCED and GPS-
COUNTY-BALANCED datasets, which are statis-
tically indistinguishable. Focusing on the differ-
ence between GPS-MSA-BALANCED and LOC-
MSA-BALANCED, we plot the difference in age
probabilities in Figure 3, showing that GPS-
MSA-BALANCED includes many more teens and
people in their early twenties, while LOC-MSA-
BALANCED includes more people at middle age
and older. Young people are especially likely to
use social media on cellphones (Lenhart, 2015),
where location tagging would be more relevant
than when Twitter is accessed via a personal com-
puter. Social media users in the age brackets 18-
29 and 30-49 are also more likely to tag their lo-
cations in social media posts than social media
users in the age brackets 50-64 and 65+ (Zickuhr,
2013), with women and men tagging at roughly
equal rates. Table 2 shows that the GPS-MSA-
BALANCED and GPS-COUNTY-BALANCED sam-
ples contain significantly more women than LOC-

4 Impact on linguistic generalizations

Many papers use Twitter data to draw conclusions
about the relationship between language and ge-
ography. What role do the demographic differ-
ences identified in the previous section have on
the linguistic conclusions that emerge? We mea-
sure the differences between the linguistic corpora
obtained by each data acquisition approach. Since
the GPS-MSA-BALANCED and GPS-COUNTY-
BALANCED methods have nearly identical pat-
terns of usage and demographics, we focus on the
difference between GPS-MSA-BALANCED and
LOC-MSA-BALANCED. These datasets differ in
age and gender, so we also directly measure the
impact of these demographic factors on the use of
geographically-specific linguistic variables.

4.1 Methods
Discovering geographical linguistic variables
We focus on lexical variation, which is relatively
easy to identify in text corpora. Monroe et al.
(2008) survey a range of alternative statistics for
finding lexical variables, demonstrating that a reg-
ularized log-odds ratio strikes a good balance be-
tween distinctiveness and robustness. A similar
approach is implemented in SAGE (Eisenstein et
al., 2011a)2, which we use here. For each sam-

2https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/jos-gender-2014

ple — GPS-MSA-BALANCED and LOC-MSA-
BALANCED — we apply SAGE to identify the
twenty-five most salient lexical items for each
metropolitan area.

Keyword annotation Previous research has
identified two main types of geographical lexi-
cal variables. The first are non-standard words
and spellings, such as hella and yinz, which have
been found to be very frequent in social me-
dia (Eisenstein, 2015). Other researchers have fo-
cused on the “long tail” of entity names (Roller
et al., 2012). A key question is the relative im-
portance of these two variable types, since this
would decide whether geo-linguistic differences
are primarily topic-based or stylistic. It is there-
fore important to know whether the frequency
of these two variable types depends on proper-
ties of the sample. To test this, we take the
lexical items identified by SAGE (25 per MSA,
for both the GPS-MSA-BALANCED and LOC-
MSA-BALANCED samples), and annotate them
as NONSTANDARD-WORD, ENTITY-NAME, or
OTHER. Annotation for ambiguous cases is based
on the majority sense in randomly-selected exam-
ples. Overall, we identify 24 NONSTANDARD-
WORDs and 185 ENTITY-NAMEs.

Inferring author demographics As described
in § 3.1.2, we can obtain an approximate distri-
bution over author age and gender by linking self-
reported first names with aggregate statistics from
the United States Census. To sharpen these esti-
mates, we now consider the text as well, build-
ing a simple latent variable model in which both
the name and the word counts are drawn from dis-
tributions associated with the latent age and gen-
der (Chang et al., 2010). The model is shown in
Figure 4, and involves the following generative
process:

For each user i ∈ {1...N},
(a) draw the age, ai ∼ Categorical(π)
(b) draw the gender, gi ∼ Categorical(0.5)

where we elide the second parameter of the multi-

expectation-maximization to perform inference in
this model, binning the latent age variable into
four groups: 0-17, 18-29, 30-39, above 40.3 Be-
cause the distribution of names given demograph-
ics is available from the Social Security data, we
clamp the value of φ throughout the EM proce-
dure. Other work in the domain of demographic
prediction often involves more complex meth-
ods (Nguyen et al., 2014; Volkova and Durme,
2015), but since it is not the focus of our research,
we take a relatively simple approach here, assum-
ing no labeled data for demographic attributes.

4.2 Results
Linguistic differences by dataset We first con-
sider the impact of the data acquisition tech-
nique on the lexical features associated with each
city. The keywords identified in GPS-MSA-
BALANCED dataset feature more geographically-
specific non-standard words, which occur at a rate
of 3.9 × 10−4 in GPS-MSA-BALANCED, versus
2.6×10−4 in LOC-MSA-BALANCED; this differ-
ence is statistically significant (p < .05, t = 3.2).4

3Binning is often employed in work on text-based age pre-
diction (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009; Rao et al., 2010; Rosen-
thal and McKeown, 2011); it enables word and name counts
to be shared over multiple ages, and avoids the complexity
inherent in regressing a high-dimensional textual predictors
against a numerical variable.

4We employ a paired t-test, comparing the difference in
frequency for each word across the two datasets. Since we
cannot test the complete set of entity names or non-standard
words, this quantifies whether the observed difference is ro-
bust across the subset of the vocabulary that we have selected.

Figure 5: Aggregate statistics for geographically-
specific non-standard words and entity names
across imputed demographic groups, from the
GPS-MSA-BALANCED sample.

For entity names, the difference between datasets
was not significant, with a rate of 4.0 × 10−3 for
GPS-MSA-BALANCED, and 3.7×10−3 for LOC-
MSA-BALANCED. Note that these rates include
only the non-standard words and entity names de-
tected by SAGE as among the top 25 most distinc-
tive for one of the ten largest cities in the US; of
course there are many other relevant terms that are
below this threshold.

In a pilot study of the GPS-COUNTY-
BALANCED data, we found few linguistic differ-
ences from GPS-MSA-BALANCED, in either the
aggregate word-group frequencies or the SAGE
word lists — despite the geographical imbalances
shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. Informal ex-
amination of specific counties shows some ex-
pected differences: for example, Clayton County,
which hosts Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport,
includes terms related to air travel, and other coun-
ties include mentions of local cities and business
districts. But the aggregate statistics for under-
represented counties are not substantially different
from those of overrepresented counties, and are
largely unaffected by county-based resampling.

Demographics Aggregate linguistic statistics
for demographic groups are shown in Fig-
ure 5. Men use significantly more geographically-
specific entity names than women (p � .01, t =

8.0), but gender differences for geographically-
specific non-standard words are not significant
(p ≈ .2).5 Younger people use significantly
more geographically-specific non-standard words
than older people (ages 0–29 versus 30+, p �
.01, t = 7.8), and older people mention signifi-
cantly more geographically-specific entity names
(p � .01, t = 5.1). Of particular interest
is the intersection of age and gender: the use
of geographically-specific non-standard words de-
creases with age much more profoundly for men
than for women; conversely, the frequency of
mentioning geographically-specific entity names
increases dramatically with age for men, but to a
much lesser extent for women. The observation
that high-level patterns of geographically-oriented
language are more age-dependent for men than
for women suggests an intriguing site for future
research on the intersectional construction of lin-
guistic identity.

For a more detailed view, we apply SAGE to
identify the most salient lexical items for each
MSA, subgrouped by age and gender. Table 3
shows word lists for New York (the largest MSA)
and Dallas (the 5th-largest MSA), using the GPS-
MSA-BALANCED sample. Non-standard words
tend to be used by the youngest authors: ilysm (’I
love you so much’), ight (’alright’), oomf (’one of
my followers’). Older authors write more about
local entities (manhattan, nyc, houston), with
men focusing on sports-related entities (harden,
watt, astros, mets, texans), and women above the
age of 40 emphasizing religiously-oriented terms
(proverb, islam, rejoice, psalm).

discussion of gender and standardness.

5 Impact on text-based geolocation

A major application of geotagged social media
is to predict the geolocation of individuals based
on their text (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Cheng et
al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Hong et
al., 2012; Han et al., 2014). Text-based geolo-
cation has obvious commercial implications for
location-based marketing and opinion analysis; it
is also potentially useful for researchers who want
to measure geographical phenomena in social me-
dia, and wish to access a larger set of individuals
than those who provide their locations explicitly.

Previous research has obtained impressive ac-
curacies for text-based geolocation: for exam-
ple, Hong et al. (2012) report a median error of
120 km, which is roughly the distance from Los
Angeles to San Diego, in a prediction space over
the entire continental United States. These accura-
cies are computed on test sets that were acquired
through the same procedures as the training data,
so if the acquisition procedures have geographic
and demographic biases, then the resulting accu-
racy estimates will be biased too. Consequently,
they may be overly optimistic (or pessimistic!) for
some types of authors. In this section, we explore
where these text-based geolocation methods are
most and least accurate.

5.1 Methods

Our data is drawn from the ten largest metropoli-
tan areas in the United States, and we formulate
text-based geolocation as a ten-way classification
problem, similar to Han et al. (2014).6 Using our

6Many previous papers have attempted to identify the pre-
cise latitude and longitude coordinates of individual authors,
but obtaining high accuracy on this task involves much more
complex methods, such as latent variable models (Eisenstein
et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2012), or multilevel grid struc-
tures (Cheng et al., 2010; Roller et al., 2012). Tuning such

2144



user-balanced samples, we apply ten-fold cross
validation, and tune the regularization parameter
on a development fold, using the vocabulary of the
sample as features.

5.2 Results

Many author-attribute prediction tasks become
substantially easier as more data is avail-
able (Burger et al., 2011), and text-based ge-
olocation is no exception. Since GPS-MSA-
BALANCED and LOC-MSA-BALANCED have
very different usage rates (Figure 2), perceived dif-
ferences in accuracy may be purely attributable to
the amount of data available per user, rather than
to users in one group being inherently harder to
classify than another. For this reason, we bin users
by the number of messages in our sample of their
timeline, and report results separately for each bin.
All errorbars represent 95% confidence intervals.

GPS versus location As seen in Figure 6a, there
is little difference in accuracy across sampling
techniques: the location-based sample is slightly
easier to geolocate at each usage bin, but the dif-
ference is not statistically significant. However,
due to the higher average usage rate in GPS-
MSA-BALANCED(see Figure 2), the overall accu-
racy for a sample of users will appear to be higher
on this data.

Demographics Next, we measure classification
accuracy by gender and age, using the posterior
distribution from the expectation-maximization al-
gorithm to predict the gender of each user (broadly
similar results are obtained by using the prior dis-
tribution). For this experiment, we focus on the
GPS-MSA-BALANCED sample. As shown in
Figure 6b, text-based geolocation is consistently
more accurate for male authors, across almost the
entire spectrum of usage rates. As shown in Fig-
ure 6c, older users also tend to be easier to ge-
olocate: at each usage level, the highest accuracy
goes to one of the two older groups, and the dif-
ference is significant in almost every case. As dis-
cussed in § 4, older male users tend to mention
many entities, particularly sports-related terms;
these terms are apparently more predictive than
the non-standard spellings and slang favored by
younger authors.

models can be challenging, and the resulting accuracies might
be affected by initial conditions or hyperparameters. We
therefore focus on classification, employing the familiar and
well-understood method of logistic regression.

6 Related Work

Several researchers have studied how adoption of
Internet technology varies with factors such as so-
cioeconomic status, age, gender, and living condi-
tions (Zillien and Hargittai, 2009). Hargittai and
Litt (2011) use a longitudinal survey methodology
to compare the effects of gender, race, and topics
of interest on Twitter usage among young adults.
Geographic variation in Twitter adoption has been
considered both internationally (Kulshrestha et al.,
2012) and within the United States, using both
the Twitter location field (Mislove et al., 2011)
and per-message GPS coordinates (Hecht and
Stephens, 2014). Aggregate demographic statis-
tics of Twitter users’ geographic census blocks
were computed by O’Connor et al. (2010) and
Eisenstein et al. (2011b); Malik et al. (2015) use
census demographics in spatial error model. These
papers draw similar conclusions, showing that the
the distribution of geotagged tweets over the US
population is not random, and that higher usage
is correlated with urban areas, high income, more
ethnic minorities, and more young people. How-
ever, this prior work did not consider the biases
introduced by relying on geotagged messages, nor
the consequences for geo-linguistic analysis.

Twitter has often been used to study the ge-
ographical distribution of linguistic information,
and of particular relevance are Twitter-based stud-
ies of regional dialect differences (Eisenstein et
al., 2010; Doyle, 2014; Gonçalves and Sánchez,
2014; Eisenstein, 2015) and text-based geoloca-
tion (Cheng et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2012; Han et
al., 2014). This prior work rarely considers the im-
pact of the demographic confounds, or of the geo-
graphical biases mentioned in § 3. Recent research
shows that accuracies of core language technol-
ogy tasks such as part-of-speech tagging are cor-
related with author demographics such as author
age (Hovy and Søgaard, 2015); our results on lo-
cation prediction are in accord with these findings.
Hovy (2015) show that including author demo-
graphics can improve text classification, a similar
approach might improve text-based geolocation as
well.

We address the question about the impact of
geographical biases and demographic confounds
by measuring differences between three sampling
techniques, in both language use and in the ac-
curacy of text-based geolocation. Recent unpub-
lished work proposes reweighting Twitter data to

results suggest that the linguistic differences be-
tween user-supplied profile locations and per-
message geotags are more significant, and that ac-
counting for the geographical biases among geo-
tagged messages is not sufficient to offer a repre-
sentative sample of Twitter users.

7 Discussion

Geotagged Twitter data offers an invaluable re-
source for studying the interaction of language and
geography, and is helping to usher in a new gener-
ation of location-aware language technology. This
makes critical investigation of the nature of this
data source particularly important. This paper un-
covers demographic confounds in the linguistic
analysis of geo-located Twitter data, but is lim-
ited to demographics that can be readily induced
from given names. A key task for future work is to
quantify the representativeness of geotagged Twit-
ter data with respect to factors such as race and so-
cioeconomic status, while holding geography con-
stant. However, these features may be more diffi-
cult to impute from names alone. Another cru-
cial task is to expand this investigation beyond the
United States, as the varying patterns of use for so-
cial media across countries (Pew Research Center,
2012) implies that the findings here cannot be ex-
pected to generalize to every international context.
