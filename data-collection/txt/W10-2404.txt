Abstract 

Transliteration is generally defined as phonetic 

translation of names across languages. Ma-

chine Transliteration is a critical technology in 

many domains, such as machine translation, 

cross-language information retriev-

al/extraction, etc. Recent research has shown 

that high quality machine transliteration sys-

tems may be developed in a language-neutral 

manner, using a reasonably sized good quality 

corpus (~15-25K parallel names) between a 

given pair of languages.  In this shared task, 

we focus on acquisition of such good quality 

names corpora in many languages, thus com-

plementing the machine transliteration shared 

task that is concurrently conducted in the same 

NEWS 2010 workshop.  Specifically, this task 

focuses on mining the Wikipedia paired enti-

ties data (aka, inter-wiki-links) to produce 

high-quality transliteration data that may be 

used for transliteration tasks. 

1 Task Description  

The task is to develop a system for mining single 

word transliteration pairs from the standard Wi-

kipedia paired topics (aka, Wikipedia Inter-

Language Links, or WIL
1
) in one or more of the 

specified language pairs. The WIL’s link articles 

on the same topic in multiple languages, and are 

traditionally used as a parallel language resource 

for many NLP applications, such as Machine 

Translation, Crosslingual Search, etc.  Specific 

WIL’s of interest for our task are those that con-

tain proper names – either wholly or partly – 

which can yield rich transliteration data.   

Each WIL consists of a topic in the source and 

the language pair, and the task is to identify parts 

of the topic (in the respective language titles) that 

are transliterations of each other. A seed data set 

(of about 1K transliteration pairs) would be pro-

vided for each language pair, and are the only 

resource to be used for developing a mining sys-

tem.  The participants are expected to produce a

paired list of source-target single word named 

entities, for every WIL provided. At the evalua-

tion time, a random subset of WIL’s (about 1K 

WIL’s) in each language pair that are hand la-

beled would be used to test the results produced 

by the participants.  

Participants may use only the 1K seed data 

provided by the organizers to produce “standard” 

results; this restriction is imposed to provide a 

meaningful way of comparing the effective me-

thods and approaches.  However, “non-standard” 

runs would be permitted where participants may 

use more seed data or any language-specific re-

source available to them.

3 Participation 

1. Registration (1 Feb 2010) 

a. Prospective participants are to register to 
the NEWS-2010 Workshop homepage, for 

this specific task. 

2. Training Data Release (26 Feb 2010) 

a. Registered participants are to obtain seed 
and Wikipedia data from the Shared Task 

organizers. 

 

29



3. Evaluation Script (1 March 2010) 

a. A sample submission and an evaluation 
script will be released in due course. 

b. The participants must make sure that their 
output is produced in a way that the evalua-

tion script may run and produce the ex-

pected output. 

c. The same script (with held out test data and 
the user outputs) would be used for final 

evaluation. 

 

4. Testing data (13 March 2010) 

a. The test data would be a held out data of 
approximately 1K “gold-standard” mined 

data. 

b. The submissions (up to 10) would be tested 
against the test data, and the results pub-

lished. 

 

5. Results (27 March 2010) 

a. On the results announcement date, the 
evaluation results would be published on 

the Workshop website. 

b. Note that only the scores (in respective me-
trics) of the participating systems on each 

language pairs would be published, but no 

explicit ranking of the participating sys-

tems.   

c. Note that this is a shared evaluation task 
and not a competition; the results are meant 

to be used to evaluate systems on common 

data set with common metrics, and not to 

rank the participating systems.  While the 

participants can cite the performance of 

their systems (scores on metrics) from the 

workshop report, they should not use any 

ranking information in their publications. 

d. Further, all participants should agree not to 
reveal identities of other participants in any 

of their publications unless you get permis-

sion from the other respective participants. 

If the participants want to remain anonym-

ous in published results, they should inform 

the organizers at the time of registration.  

Note that the results of their systems would 

still be published, but with the participant 

identities masked. As a result, in this case, 

your organization name will still appear in 

the web site as one of participants, but it is 

not linked explicitly with your results. 

 

6. Short Papers on Task (5 April 2010) 

a. Each submitting site is required to submit a 
4-page system paper (short paper) for its 

submissions, including their approach, data 

used and the results. 

b. All system short papers will be included in 
the proceedings. Selected short papers will 

be presented in the NEWS 2010 workshop.  

Acceptance of the system short-papers 

would be announced together with that of 

other papers.

Seed transliteration data:  In addition we pro-

vide approximately 1K parallel names in each 

language pair as seed data to develop any metho-

dology to identify transliterations.  For standard 

run results, only this seed data could be used, 

though for non-standard runs, more data or other 

linguistics resources may be used.

Test set:  We plan to randomly select ~1000 wi-

kipedia links (from the large noisy Inter-wiki-

links) as test-set, and manually extract the single 

word transliteration pairs associated with each of 

these WILs.  Please note that a given WIL can 

provide 0, 1 or more single-word transliteration 

pairs.  To keep the task simple, we consider as 

correct transliterations only those that are clear 

transliterations word-per-word (morphological 

variations one or both sides are not considered 

transliterations) These 1K test set will be a subset 

of Wikipedia data provided to the user.  The gold 

dataset might look like the following (assuming 

the items 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Tables 3 and 4 were 

among the randomly selected WIL’s from To-

Mine-Data).

Evaluation: The participants are expected to 

mine such single-word transliteration data for 

every specific WIL, though the evaluation would 

be done only against the randomly selected, 

hand-labeled test set.  At evaluation time, the 

task organizers check every WIL in test set from 

among the user-provided results, to evaluate the 

quality of the submission on the 3 metrics de-

scribed later.  

Additional information on data use: 

1. Seed data may have ownership and appropri-
ate licenses may need to be procured for use.  

2. To-be-mined Wikipedia data is extracted 
from Wikipedia (in Jan/Feb 2010), and dis-

tributed as-is.  No assurances that they are 

correct, complete or consistent.

Figure 1: Overview of the mining task and evaluation 

 

3. The hand-labeled test set is created by 
NEWS shared task organizers, and will be 

used for computing the metrics for a given 

submission. 

4. We expect that the participants to use only 
the seed data (parallel names) provided by 

the Shared Task for a standard run to ensure 

a fair evaluation and a meaningful compari-

son between the effectiveness of approaches 

taken by various systems.  At least one such 

run (using only the data provided by the 

shared task) is mandatory for all participants 

for a given task that they participate in.   

5. If more data (either parallel names data or 
monolingual data), or any language-specific 

modules were used, then all such runs using 

extra data or resources must be marked as 

“Non-standard”.  For such non-standard 

runs, it is required to disclose the size and 

characteristics of the data or the nature of 

languages resources used, in their paper. 

6. A participant may submit a maximum of 10 
runs for a given language pair (including one 

or more “standard” run).  There could be 

more standard runs, without exceeding 10 

(including the non-standard runs). 

6 Paper Format 

All paper submissions to NEWS 2010 should 

follow the ACL 2010 paper submission policy 

(http://acl2010.org/papers.html), including paper 

format, blind review policy and title and author 

format convention. Shared task system short pa-

pers are also in two-column format without ex-

ceeding four (4) pages plus any extra page for 

references. However, there is no need for double-

blind requirements, as the users may refer to 

their runs and metrics in the published results.   

7 Evaluation Metrics 

We plan to measure the quality of the mining 

task using the following measures:  

 

1. PrecisionCorrectTransliterations (PTrans) 
2. RecallCorrectTransliteration (RTrans) 
3. F-ScoreCorrectTransliteration (FTrans).   
 

Please refer to the following figures for the ex-

planations: 
 

A = True Positives (TP) = Pairs that were identi-

fied as "Correct Transliterations" by the partici-

pant and were indeed "Correct Transliterations" 

as per the gold standard 

B = False Positives (FP) = Pairs that were identi-

fied as "Correct Transliterations" by the partici-

pant but they were "Incorrect Transliterations" as 

per the gold standard. 

C = False Negatives (FN) = Pairs that were iden-

tified as "Incorrect Transliterations" by the par-

ticipant but were actually "Correct Translitera-

tions" as per the gold standard. 

32



D = True Negatives (TN) = Pairs that were iden-

tified as "Incorrect Transliterations" by the par-

ticipant and were indeed "Incorrect Translitera-

tions" as per the gold standard. 
 

1. RecallCorrectTransliteration  (RTrans) 
The recall is going to be computed using the 

sample as follows: 

𝑅𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 =
𝑇𝑃

𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁
=  

𝐴

𝐴 + 𝐶
=  

𝐴

𝑇
 

 

2. PrecisionCorrectTransliteration  (PTrans) 
The precision is going to be computed using the 

sample as follows: 

𝑃𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 =
𝑇𝑃

𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃
=  

𝐴

𝐴 + 𝐵
 

3. F-Score (F) 

𝐹 =
2 ∗ 𝑃𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 ∗ 𝑅𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝑃𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 + 𝑅𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
