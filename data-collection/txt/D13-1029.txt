Abstract

Many errors in coreference resolution come
from semantic mismatches due to inadequate
world knowledge. Errors in named-entity
linking (NEL), on the other hand, are of-
ten caused by superficial modeling of entity
context. This paper demonstrates that these
two tasks are complementary. We introduce
NECO, a new model for named entity linking
and coreference resolution, which solves both
problems jointly, reducing the errors made on
each. NECO extends the Stanford determinis-
tic coreference system by automatically link-
ing mentions to Wikipedia and introducing
new NEL-informed mention-merging sieves.
Linking improves mention-detection and en-
ables new semantic attributes to be incorpo-
rated from Freebase, while coreference pro-
vides better context modeling by propagat-
ing named-entity links within mention clus-
ters. Experiments show consistent improve-
ments across a number of datasets and ex-
perimental conditions, including over 11% re-
duction in MUC coreference error and nearly
21% reduction in F1 NEL error on ACE 2004
newswire data.

1 Introduction

Coreference resolution and named-entity linking are
closely related problems, but have been largely stud-
ied in isolation. This paper demonstrates that they
are complementary by introducing a simple joint
model that improves performance on both tasks.

Coreference resolution is the task of determining
when two textual mentions name the same individ-

[Michael Eisner]1 and [Donald Tsang]2 announced the
grand opening of [[Hong Kong]3 Disneyland]4 yester-
day. [Eisner]1 thanked [the President]2 and welcomed
[fans]5 to [the park]4.

coreference resolution and NEL.

ual. The biggest challenge in coreference resolu-
tion — accounting for 42% of errors in the state-
of-the-art Stanford system — is the inability to rea-
son effectively about background semantic knowl-
edge (Lee et al., 2013). For example, consider the
sentence in Figure 1. “President” refers to “Donald
Tsang” and “the park” refers to “Hong Kong Dis-
neyland,” but automated algorithms typically lack
the background knowledge to draw such inferences.
Incorporating knowledge is challenging, and many
efforts to do so have actually hurt performance,
e.g. (Lee et al., 2011; Durrett and Klein, 2013).

Named-entity linking (NEL) is the task of match-
ing textual mentions to corresponding entities in a
knowledge base, such as Wikipedia or Freebase.
Such links provide rich sources of semantic knowl-
edge about entity attributes — Freebase includes
president as Tsang’s title and Disneyland as hav-
ing the attribute park. But NEL is itself a chal-
lenging problem, and finding the correct link re-
quires disambiguating based on the mention string
and often non-local contextual features. For exam-
ple, “Michael Eisner” is relatively unambiguous but
the isolated mention “Eisner” is more challenging.
However, these mentions could be clustered with
a coreference model, allowing for improved NEL
through link propagation from the easier mentions.

We present NECO, a new algorithm for jointly solv-
ing named entity linking and coreference resolu-
tion. Our work is related to that of Ratinov and
Roth (2012), which also uses knowledge derived
from an NEL system to improve coreference. How-
ever, NECO is the first joint model we know of, is
purely deterministic with no learning phase, does
automatic mention detection, and improves perfor-
mance on both tasks.

NECO extends the Stanford’s sieve-based model,
in which a high recall mention detection phase is
followed by a sequence of cluster merging opera-
tions ordered by decreasing precision (Raghunathan
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013). At each step, it
merges two clusters only if all available information
about their respective entities is consistent. We use
NEL to increase recall during the mention detection
phase and introduce two new cluster-merging sieves,
which compare the Freebase attributes of entities.
NECO also improves NEL by initially favoring high
precision linking results and then propagating links
and attributes as clusters are formed.

In summary we make the following contributions:

• We introduce NECO, a novel, joint approach
to solving coreference and NEL, demonstrating
that these tasks are complementary by achiev-
ing joint error reduction.

• We present experiments showing improved per-
formance at coreference resolution, given both
gold and automatic mention detection: e.g.,
6.2 point improvement in MUC recall on ACE
2004 newswire text and 3.1 point improvement
in MUC precision the CoNLL 2011 test set.

• NECO also leads to better performance at
named-entity linking, given both gold and au-
tomatic linking, improving F1 from 61.7% to
69.2% on a newly labeled test set.1

2 Background

We make use of existing models for coreference res-
olution and named entity linking.

2.1 Coreference Resolution

Coreference resolution is the the task of identifying
all text spans (called mentions) that refer to the same
entity, forming mention clusters.

Stanford’s Sieve Model is a state-of-the-art coref-
erence resolver comprising a pipeline of “sieves”
that merge coreferent mentions according to deter-
ministic rules. Mentions are automatically predicted
by selecting all noun phrases (NP), pronouns, and
named entities. Each sieve either merges a cluster
to its single best antecedent from a list of previous
clusters, or declines to merge.

Higher precision sieves are applied earlier in the
pipeline according to the following order, looking at
different aspects of the text, including: (1) speaker
identification, (2-3) exact and relaxed string matches
between mentions, (4) precise constructs, including
appositives, acronyms and demonyms, (5-9) differ-
ent notions of strict and relaxed head matches be-
tween mentions, and finally (10) a number of syn-
tactic and distance cues for pronoun resolution.

2.2 Named Entity Linking

Named-entity linking (NEL) is the task of identi-
fying mentions in a text and linking them to the
entity they name in a knowledge base, usually
Wikipedia. NECO uses two existing NEL sys-
tems: GLOW (Ratinov et al., 2011) and Wikipedi-
aMiner (Milne and Witten, 2008).

WikipediaMiner links mentions based on a notion
of semantic similarity to Wikipedia pages, consider-
ing all substrings up to a fixed length. Since there
are often many possible links, it disambiguates by
choosing the entity whose Wikipedia page is most
semantically related to the nearby context of the
mention. The semantic scoring function includes n-
gram statistics and also counts shared links to other
unambiguous mentions in the text.

GLOW finds mentions by selecting all the NPs
and named entities in the text. Linking is framed
as an integer linear programming optimization prob-
lem that takes into account using similar local con-
straints but also includes global constraints such as
entity link co-occurrence.

Both systems return confidence values. To main-
tain high precision, NECO uses an ensemble of

• Let Exemplar(c) be a representative mention of the cluster c, computed as defined below
• Let cj be an antecedent cluster of ci if cj has a mention which is before the first mention of ci
• Let l(m) be a Wikipedia page linked to mention m or ∅ if there is no link
• Let l(c) be a Wikipedia page linked to mention Exemplar(c) or ∅ if there is no link

1. Initialize Linked Mentions:
(a) Let MNEL = {mi | i = 1 . . . p} be the NEL output mentions, mi, each with a link l(mi)
(b) Let MCR = {mi | i = 1 . . . q} be the mentions mi from coreference mention detection
(c) Let M ←MCR ∪MNEL (Sec. 3.1)
(d) Update entity links for all m ∈M and prune M (Sec. 3.2)
(e) Extract attributes from Wikipedia and Freebase for all m ∈M (Sec. 3.3)
(f) Let C ←M be singleton mention clusters where Exemplar(ci) = mi, l(ci) = l(mi)

2. Merge Clusters: For every sieve S (including NEL sieves, Sec. 3.6) and cluster ci ∈ C
(a) For every cluster cj , j = [i− 1 . . . 1] (traverse the preceding clusters in reverse order)

confidence links.

3 Joint Coreference and Linking

We introduce a joint model for coreference resolu-
tion and NEL. Building on the Stanford sieve ar-
chitecture, our algorithm incrementally constructs
clusters of mentions using deterministic coreference
rules under NEL constraints.

Figure 2 presents the complete algorithm. The in-
put to NECO is a document and the output is a set C
of coreference clusters, with links l(c) to Wikipedia
pages for a subset of the clusters c ∈ C. Step 1
detects mentions, merging the outputs of the base
systems (Sec. 3.1). Step 2 repeatedly merges coref-
erence clusters, while ensuring that NEL constraints
(Sec. 3.4) are satisfied. It uses the original Stan-
ford sieves and also two new NEL-informed sieves
(Sec. 3.6). NEL links are propagated to new clusters
as they are formed (Sec. 3.5).

3.1 Mention Detection

In Steps 1(a-c) in Fig. 2, NECO combines mentions
from the base coreference and NEL systems.

Let MCR be the set of mentions returned by us-
ing Stanford’s rule-based mention detection algo-
rithm (Lee et al., 2013). Let MNEL be the set of
mentions output by the two NEL systems. NECO
creates an initial set of mentions, M , by taking the

union of all the mentions in MNEL and MCR. In
practice, taking the union increases diversity in the
mention pool. For example, it is often the case that
MNEL will include sub-phrases such as “Suharto”
when they are part of a larger mention “ex-dictator
Suharto” that is detected in MCR.

3.2 Mention Entity Links and Pruning

Step 1(d) in Fig. 2 assigns Wikipedia links to a sub-
set of the detected mentions.

For mentions m output by the base NEL sys-
tems, we assign an exact link l(m) if the entire
mention span is linked. Mentions m′ that differ
from an exact linked mention m by only a pre- or
post-fix stop word are similarly assigned exact links
l(m′) = l(m). For example, the mention “the pres-
ident” will be assigned the same link as “president”
but “The governor of Alaska Sarah Palin” would not
be assigned an exact link to Sarah Palin.

For mentions m′ that do not receive an exact link,
we assign a head link h(m′) if the head word2 m has
been linked, by setting h(m′) = l(m). For instance,
the head link for the mention “President Clinton”
(with “Clinton” as head word) will be the Wikipedia
title of Bill Clinton. We use head links for the
Relaxed NEL sieve (Sec. 3.6).

Next, we define L(m) to be the set con-

2A head word is assigned to every mention with the Stanford
parser head finding rules (Klein and Manning, 2003).

total attributes).

taining l(m) and l(m′) for all sub-phrases m′

of m. We add the sub-phrase links only
if their confidence is higher than the confi-
dence for l(m). For instance, assuming ap-
propriate confidence values, L(m) would in-
clude the pages for {List of governors of
Alaska, Alaska, Sarah Palin} given the
mention “The governor of Alaska Sarah Palin.” We
will use L(m) for NEL constraints and filtering
(Sec. 3.4).

After updating the entity links for all mentions,
NECO prunes spurious mentions that begin or
end with a stop word where the remaining sub-
expression of the mention exists in M . It also re-
moves time expressions and numbers from M if they
are not included in MNEL.

3.3 Mention Attributes

Step 1(e) in Fig. 2 also assigns attributes for a
mention m linked to Wikipedia page l(m), at both
coarse and fine-grained levels, based on information
from the Freebase entry corresponding to exact link
l(m) or head link h(m).

The coarse attributes include gender, type, and
NER classes such as PERSON, LOCATION, and OR-
GANIZATION. These attributes are part of the orig-
inal Stanford coreference system and are used to
avoid merging conflicting clusters. We use the Free-
base values for these attributes when available. For
instance, if the linked entity contains the Freebase
type location or organization, we include the coarse
type to LOCATION or ORGANIZATION respectively.
In order to account for both links to specific peo-

ple (Barack Obama) and generic links to positions
held by people (President), we include the type PER-
SON if the linked entity has any of the Freebase types
person, job title, or government office or title. If no
coarse Freebase types are available for an attribute,
we default to predicted NER classes.

We add fine-grained attributes from Freebase and
Wikipedia by importing additional type information.
We use all of the Freebase notable types, a set of
hundreds of commonly used Freebase types, rang-
ing from us president to tropical cyclone and syn-
thpop album. We also include all of the Wikipedia
categories, on average six per entity. For example,
the mention “Indonesia” is assigned fine-grained at-
tributes such as book subject, military power, and
olympic participating country. Since many of these
fine-grained attributes are extremely specific, we use
the last word of each attribute to define an addi-
tional fine-grained attribute (see Fig. 3). These fine-
grained attributes are used in the Relaxed NEL sieve
(Sec. 3.6).

3.4 NEL Constraints
While applying sieves to merge clusters in Figure 2
Step 2(a), NECO uses NEL constraints to eliminate
some otherwise acceptable merges.

We avoid merging inconsistent clusters that link
to different entities. Clusters ci and cj are incon-
sistent if both are linked (i.e., both clusters have
non-null entity assignments) and l(ci) 6= l(cj) or
h(ci) 6= h(cj). Also, in order to consider an an-
tecedent cluster c as a merge candidate, we require a
pair of entities in the set of linked entities L(c) to be
related to one another in Freebase. Two entities are
related in Freebase if they both appear in a relation;
for example, Bill Clinton and Arkansas are
related because Bill Clinton has a “governor-of” re-
lation with Arkansas.

3.5 Merging Clusters and Update Entity Links
When two clusters ci and cj are merged to form a
new cluster ck, the entity link information L(ck),
l(ck), and h(ck) must be updated (Step 2 of Fig. 2).
We set L(ck) to the union of the linked entities found
in l(ci) and l(cj) and merge coarse attributes at this
point.

In order to set the exact and head entity links
l(ck) and h(ck), we use the exemplar mention

292



Exemplar(ck) that denotes the most representative
mention of the cluster. Exemplar(c) is selected
according to a set of rules in the Stanford system,
based on textual position and mention type (proper
noun vs. common). We augment this function by
considering information from exact and head en-
tity links as well. Mentions appearing earlier in
text, proper mentions, and mentions that have ex-
act or head named-entity links are preferred to those
which do not. Given exemplars, we set l(ck) =
l(Exemplar(ck)) and h(ck) = h(Exemplar(ck)).

3.6 NEL Sieves

Finally, we introduce two new sieves that use NEL
information at the beginning and end of the Stan-
ford sieves pipeline in the merging stage (Step 2 of
Fig. 2).

Exact NEL sieve The Exact NEL sieve merges
two clusters ci and cj if both are linked and their
links match, l(ci) = l(cj). For example, all men-
tions that have been linked to Barack Obama will
become members of the same coreference cluster.
Because the Exact NEL sieve has high precision, we
place it at the very beginning of the pipeline.

Relaxed NEL sieve The Relaxed NEL sieve uses
fine-grained attributes of the linked mentions to
merge proper nouns with common nouns when they
share attributes. For example, this sieve is able to
merge the proper mention “Disneyland” with the
“the mysterious park”, because park is one of the
fine-grained attributes assigned to Disneyland.

More formally, let mi = Exemplar(ci) and
mj = Exemplar(cj). For every common noun
mention mi, we merge ci with an antecedent clus-
ter cj if (1) mj is a linked proper noun, (2) if mi or
the title of its linked Wikipedia page is in the list of
fine-grained attributes of mj , or (3) if h(mj) is re-
lated to the head link h(mi) according to Freebase
as defined above.

Because this sieve has low precision, we only
allow merges between mentions that have a maxi-
mum distance of three sentences between one an-
other. We add the Relaxed NEL sieve near the end
of the pipeline, just before pronoun resolution.

4 Experimental Setup

Core Components and Baselines The Stanford
sieve-based coreference system (Lee et al., 2013),
the GLOW NEL system (Ratinov et al., 2011), and
WikipediaMiner (Milne and Witten, 2008) provide
core functionality for our joint model, and are also
the state-of-the-art baselines against which we mea-
sure performance.

Parameter Settings Based on performance on the
development set, we set the GLOW’s confidence pa-
rameter to 1.0 and WikipediaMiner’s to 0.4 to assure
high-precision NEL. We also optimized for the set of
fine-grained attributes to import from Wikipedia and
Freebase, and the best way to incorporate the NEL
constraints into the sieve architecture.

Datasets We report results on the following
three datasets: ACE-NWIRE, CONLL,
and ACE-NWIRE-NEL. ACE-NWIRE, the
newswire subset of the ACE 2004 corpus (NIST,
2004), includes 128 documents. The CONLL
coreference dataset includes text from five different
domains: broadcast conversation (BC), broadcast
news (BN), magazine (MZ), newswire (NW), and
web data (WB) (Pradhan et al., 2011). The broadcast
conversation and broadcast news domains consist of
transcripts, whereas magazine and newswire contain
more standard written text. The development data
includes 303 documents and the test data includes
322 documents.

We created ACE-NWIRE-NEL by taking a
subset of ACE-NWIRE and annotating with
gold-standard entity links. We segment and link all
the expressions in text that refer to Wikipedia pages,
allowing for nested linking. For instance, both the
phrase “Hong Kong Disneyland,” and the sub-phrase
“Hong Kong” are linked. This dataset includes 12
documents and 350 linked entities.

Metrics We evaluate our system using MUC (Vi-
lain et al., 1995), B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998),
and pairwise scores. MUC is a link-based met-
ric which measures how many clusters need to be
merged to cover the gold clusters and favors larger
clusters; B3 computes the proportion of intersec-
tion between predicted and gold clusters for every
mention and favors singletons (Recasens and Hovy,
2010). We computed the scores using the Stanford

5 Experimental Results

We first look at NECO’s performance at coreference
resolution and then evaluate its ability at NEL.

5.1 Coref. Results with Predicted Mentions
Overall System Performance on ACE Data Ta-
ble 1 shows NECO’s performance at coreference
resolution on ACE- compared to the Stanford
sieve implementation (Lee et al., 2013). The table
shows that NECO has both significantly improved
precision and recall compared to the Stanford base-
line, across all metrics. We generally observe larger
gains in MUC due to better mention detection and
the Relaxed NEL Sieve.

Contribution of System Components Table 1
also details the performance of four variants of our
system that ablate various components and features.
Specifically, we consider the following cases:

• No NEL Mentions: We discard additional
mentions, MNEL, provided by NEL (Sec. 3.1).
This increases B3 precision at the expense of
recall. Inspection shows that some of the errors
introduced by MNEL are actually due to cor-
rectly linked entities that were not annotated as
mentions in the dataset, but also some improp-
erly linked mentions.

• No Mention Pruning: We disable the initial
step of updating mention boundaries and re-
moving spurious mentions (Sec. 3.2). As ex-
pected, removing this step drops precision and
recall significantly, even compared to the No
NEL Mentions variant.

• No Attributes: Ablating coarse and fine-
grained attributes (Sec. 3.3) drops F1 and re-
call measures across all metrics. To under-
stand this effect, note that NECO uses at-
tributes in two different settings. Updating
coarse attributes tends to increase precision be-
cause it prevents dangerous merges, such as
merging “Staples” with the mention “it” in
a situation when “Staples” refers to the per-
son entity Todd Staples. Fine-grained at-
tributes also help with recall, when merging
a specific name of an entity with a mention
that uses a more general term; for instance,
“Hong Kong Disneyland” can be merged with
“the mysterious park” because “park” is a fine-
grained attribute for Disneyland. However,
when fine-grained attributes are used, precision
sometimes drops (e.g., when “president” might
merge with “Bush” when it should really merge
with “Clinton”).

• No NEL Constraints: Removing these con-
straints (Sec. 3.4) drops precision dramatically
leading to drop in F1. In the case of incor-
rect linking, however, NEL constraints can af-
fect recall. For instance, NEL constraints might
prevent merging “Staples” with “Todd Staples”
if the former were linked to the company and
the latter to the politician.

Overall System Performance on CoNLL Data
We also compare our full system (with added NEL
sieves, constraints, and mention pruning3) with the
Stanford sieve coreference system on CoNLL data

3Due to CoNLL annotation guidelines, a named entity is
added to the mention list if it is not inside a larger mention with
an exact named entity link.

ment and test data, using predicted mentions. Rows de-
noted with * indicate runs using the fully automated Stan-
ford CoreNLP pipeline rather than the predicted annota-
tions provided with the CoNLL data. Given the relatively
close results, we ran the Mann-Whitney U test for this
table; values with the + superscript are significant with
p < 0.05.

(Table 2). We ran NECO and the baseline in two set-
tings: in the first, we use the standard predicted an-
notations (for POS, parses, NER, and speaker tags)
provided with the CoNLL data, and in the second,
we use the automated Stanford CoreNLP pipeline
to predict this information. On both the develop-
ment and test sets, we gain about 1 point in MUC
F1 as well as a smaller improvement in B3. Closer
inspection indicates that our system increases pre-
cision primarily due to mention pruning and NEL
constraints. Due to the differences in mention anno-
tation guidelines between ACE and CoNLL, perfor-
mance on ACE benefits more from improved men-
tion detection from NEL. Moreover, the ACE cor-

pus is all newswire text, which contains more enti-
ties that can benefit from linking. CoNLL, on the
other hand, contains a wider variety of texts, some
of which do not mention many named entities in
Wikipedia.

To examine the performance of our system on the
different domains covered by the CoNLL data, we
also test our system on each domain separately (Ta-
ble 3). We found NEL provided the biggest im-
provement for the news domains, broadcast news
(BN) and newswire (NW). These domains espe-
cially benefit from the improved mention detection
and pruning provided by NEL, and strong linking
benefitted both precision and recall in these do-
mains. We found that the magazine (MZ) section
of the corpus benefited the least from NEL, as there
were relatively few entities that our NEL systems
were able to connect to Wikipedia.

5.2 Coreference Results with Gold Linking

Some of the errors introduced in our system are due
to incorrect or incomplete links discovered by the
automatic linking system. To assess the effect of
NEL performance on NECO, we tested on a por-
tion of ACE-NWIRE dataset for which we hand-
labeled correct links for the gold and predicted men-
tions. “NECO + Gold NEL” denotes a version of our
system which uses gold links instead of those pre-
dicted by NEL. As shown in Table 4, gold linking
significantly improves the performance of our sys-
tem across all measures. This suggests that further
work to improve automatic NEL may have substan-
tial reward.

sons. First, it reduces the coreference errors caused
by incorrect NEL links. For instance, gold link-
ing replaces the erroneous link generated by our
NEL systems for “Nasser al-Kidwa” to the correct
Wikipedia entity. As another example, two men-
tions of “Rutgers” will not be merged if one links
to the university and the other links to their football
team. Second, gold linking leads to better mention
detection and better linked mentions. For instance,
under gold linking, the whole mention, “The gover-
nor of Alaska, Sarah Palin,” is linked to the politi-
cian, while automatic linking systems only link the
substring containing her name, “Sarah Palin.” Still,
gold NEL cannot compensate for all coreference er-
rors in cases of generic or unlinked entities.

5.3 Coreference Results with Gold Mentions

Many of the previous papers evaluate coreference
resolution assuming gold mentions so we also run
under that condition (Table 5) using ACE-
NWIRE data. As the table shows, with gold mentions
our system outperforms Haghighi and Klein (2009),
Poon and Domingos (2008), Finkel and Man-
ning (2008) and the Stanford sieve algorithm across
all metrics. Our method shows a relatively smaller

gain in precision, because this condition adds no
benefit to our technique of using NEL information
for pruning mentions.

5.4 Improving Named Entity Linking

While our previous experiments show that named-
entity linking can improve coreference resolution,
we now address the question of whether coreference
techniques can help NEL. We compare NECO with
a baseline ensemble4 composed of GLOW (Ratinov
et al., 2011) and WikipediaMiner (Milne and Witten,
2008) on our ACE-NWIRE-NEL dataset (Table
6). Our system gains about 8% in absolute recall
and 5% in absolute precision. For instance, our sys-
tem correctly adds links from “Bullock” to the en-
tity Sandra Bullock because coreference reso-
lution merges two mentions. In another example, it
correctly links “company” to Nokia. Overall, there
is a 21% relative reduction in F1 error.

4We take the union of all the links returned by GLOW and
WikipediaMiner, but if they link a mention to two different en-
tities, we use only the output of WikipediaMiner.

5.5 Error Analysis

We analyzed 90 precision and recall errors and
present our findings in Table 7. Spurious mentions
accounted for the majority of non-semantic errors.
Despite the improvements that come from NEL, a
large portion of coreference errors can still be at-
tributed to incomplete semantic information, includ-
ing precision errors caused by incorrect linking. For
instance, the mention “Disney” sometimes refers to
the company, and other times refers to the amuse-
ment park; however, the NEL systems we used had
difficulty disambiguating these cases, and NECO of-
ten incorrectly merges such mentions. Overly gen-
eral fine-grained attributes caused precision errors in
cases where many proper noun mentions were po-
tential antecedents for a common noun. Although
attributes such as country are useful for resolving a
generic “country” mention, this information is insuf-
ficient when two distinct mentions such as “China”
and “Russia” both have the country attribute.

However, many recall errors are also caused by
the lack of fine-grained attributes. Finding the ideal
set of fine-grained attributes remains an open prob-
lem.

6 Related Work

Coreference resolution has a fifty year history which
defies brief summarization; see Ng (2010) for a
recent survey. Section 2.1 described the Stanford
multi-pass sieve algorithm, which is the foundation
for NECO.

Earlier coreference resolution systems used shal-
low semantics and pioneered knowledge extraction
from online encyclopedias (Ponzetto and Strube,
2006; Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Ng, 2007). Some
recent work shows improvement in coreference res-
olution by incorporating semantic information from
Web-scale structured knowledge bases. Haghighi
and Klein (2009) use a rule-based system to extract
fine-grained attributes for mentions by analyzing

precise constructs (e.g., appositives) in Wikipedia
articles. Subsequently, Haghighi and Klein (2010)
used a generative approach to learn entity types from
an initial list of unambiguous mention types. Bansal
and Klein (2012) use statistical analysis of Web n-
gram features including lexical relations.

Rahman and Ng (2011) use YAGO to extract type
relations for all mentions. These methods incor-
porate knowledge about all possible meanings of a
mention. If a mention has multiple meanings, ex-
traneous information might be associated with it.
Zheng et al. (2013) use a ranked list of candidate en-
tities for each mention and maintain the ranked list
when mentions are merged. Unlike previous work,
our method relies on NEL systems to disambiguate
possible meanings of a mention and capture high-
precision semantic knowledge from Wikipedia cate-
gories and Freebase notable types.

Ratinov and Roth (2012) investigated using NEL
to improve coreference resolution, but did not con-
sider a joint approach. They extracted attributes
from Wikipedia categories and used them as fea-
tures in a learned mention-pair model, but did not
do mention detection. Unfortunately, it is difficult
to compare directly to the results of both systems,
since they reported results on portions of ACE and
CoNLL datasets using gold mentions. However,
our approach provides independent evidence for the
benefit of NEL, and joint modeling in particular,
since it outperforms the state-of-the-art Stanford
sieve system (winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared
task (Pradhan et al., 2011)) and other recent com-
parable approaches on benchmark datasets.

Our work also builds on a long trajectory of
work in named entity resolution stemming from
SemTag (Dill et al., 2003). Section 2.2 discussed
GLOW and WikipediaMiner (Ratinov et al., 2011;
Milne and Witten, 2008). Kulkarni et al. (2009)
present an elegant collective disambiguation model,
but do not exploit the syntactic nuances gleaned by
within-document coreference resolution. Hachey et
al. (2013) provide an insightful summary and evalu-
ation of different approaches to NEL.

Observing that existing coreference resolution and
named-entity linking have complementary strengths

and weaknesses, we present a joint approach. We
introduce NECO, a novel algorithm which solves
the problems jointly, demonstrating improved per-
formance on both tasks.

We envision several ways to improve the joint
model. While the current implementation of NECO
only introduces NEL once, we could also integrate
predictions with different levels of confidence into
different sieves. It would be interesting to more
tightly integrate the NEL system so it operates on
clusters rather than individual mentions — after
each sieve merges an unlinked cluster, the algorithm
would retry NEL with the new context information.
NECO uses a relatively modest number of Freebase
attributes. While using more semantic knowledge
holds the promise of increased recall, the challenge
is maintaining precision. Finally, we would also like
to explore the extent to which a joint probabilistic
model (e.g., (Durrett and Klein, 2013)) might be
used to learn how to best make this tradeoff.
