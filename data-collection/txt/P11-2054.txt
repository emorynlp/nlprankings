Abstract 

We present an NLP system that classifies the 
assertion type of medical problems in clinical 
notes used for the Fourth i2b2/VA Challenge. 
Our classifier uses a variety of linguistic fea-
tures, including lexical, syntactic, lexico-
syntactic, and contextual features. To overcome 
an extremely unbalanced distribution of asser-
tion types in the data set, we focused our efforts 
on adding features specifically to improve the 
performance of minority classes. As a result, 
our system reached 94.17% micro-averaged and 
79.76% macro-averaged F1-measures, and 
showed substantial recall gains on the minority 
classes.  

1 Introduction 
Since the beginning of the new millennium, there 
has been a growing need in the medical community 
for Natural Language Processing (NLP) technolo-
gy to provide computable information from narra-
tive text and enable improved data quality and de-
cision-making. Many NLP researchers working 
with clinical text (i.e. documents in the electronic 
health record) are also realizing that the transition 
to machine learning techniques from traditional 
rule-based methods can lead to more efficient ways 
to process increasingly large collections of clinical 
narratives. As evidence of this transition, nearly all 
of the best-performing systems in the Fourth 
i2b2/VA Challenge (Uzuner and DuVall, 2010) 
used machine learning methods.  

In this paper, we focus on the medical assertions 
classification task. Given a medical problem men-
tioned in a clinical text, an assertion classifier must 
look at the context and choose the status of how 
the medical problem pertains to the patient by as-
signing one of six labels: present, absent, hypothet-
ical, possible, conditional, or not associated with 
the patient. The corpus for this task consists of dis-
charge summaries from Partners HealthCare (Bos-
ton, MA) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Cen-
ter, as well as discharge summaries and progress 
notes from the University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center (Pittsburgh, PA). 

Our system performed well in the i2b2/VA 
Challenge, achieving a micro-averaged F1-measure 
of 93.01%. However, two of the assertion catego-
ries (present and absent) accounted for nearly 90% 
of the instances in the data set, while the other four 
classes were relatively infrequent. When we ana-
lyzed our results, we saw that our performance on 
the four minority classes was weak (e.g., recall on 
the conditional class was 22.22%). Even though 
the minority classes are not common, they are ex-
tremely important to identify accurately (e.g., a 
medical problem not associated with the patient 
should not be assigned to the patient).  

In this paper, we present our efforts to reduce 
the performance gap between the dominant asser-
tion classes and the minority classes. We made 
three types of changes to address this issue: we 
changed the multi-class learning strategy, filtered 
the training data to remove redundancy, and added 
new features specifically designed to increase re-
call on the minority classes. We compare the per-
formance of our new classifier with our original 

311



i2b2/VA Challenge classifier and show that it per-
forms substantially better on the minority classes, 
while increasing overall performance as well. 

2 Related Work 
During the Fourth i2b2/VA Challenge, the asser-
tion classification task was tackled by participating 
researchers. The best performing system (Berry de 
Bruijn et al., 2011) reached a micro-averaged F1-
measure of 93.62%. Their breakdown of F1 scores 
on the individual classes was: present 95.94%, ab-
sent 94.23%, possible 64.33%, conditional 
26.26%, hypothetical 88.40%, and not associated 
with the patient 82.35%. Our system had the 6th 
best score out of 21 teams, with a micro-averaged 
F1-measure of 93.01%. 
    Previously, some researchers had developed sys-
tems to recognize specific assertion categories. 
Chapman et al. (2001) created the NegEx algo-
rithm, a simple rule-based system that uses regular 
expressions with trigger terms to determine wheth-
er a medical term is absent in a patient. They re-
ported 77.8% recall and 84.5% precision for 1,235 
medical problems in discharge summaries. Chap-
man et al. (2007) also introduced the ConText al-
gorithm, which extended the NegEx algorithm to 
detect four assertion categories: absent, hypothet-
ical, historical, and not associated with the patient.   
Uzuner et al. (2009) developed the Statistical As-
sertion Classifier (StAC) and showed that a ma-
chine learning approach for assertion classification 
could achieve results competitive with their own 
implementation of Extended NegEx algorithm 
(ENegEx). They used four assertion classes: pre-
sent, absent, uncertain in the patient, or not asso-
ciated with the patient. 

3 The Assertion Classifier 
We approach the assertion classification task as a 
supervised learning problem. The classifier is giv-
en a medical term within a sentence as input and 
must assign one of the six assertion categories to 
the medical term based on its surrounding context.    

3.1 Pipeline Architecture 
We built a UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004; 
Apache, 2008) based pipeline with multiple com-
ponents, as depicted in Figure 1. The architecture 
includes a section detector (adapted from earlier 

work by Meystre and Haug (2005)), a tokenizer 
(based on regular expressions to split text on white 
space characters), a part-of-speech (POS) tagger 
(OpenNLP (Baldridge et al., 2005) module with 
trained model from cTAKES (Savova et al., 
2010)), a context analyzer (local implementation of 
the ConText algorithm (Chapman et al., 2001)), 
and a normalizer based on the LVG (Lexical Vari-
ants Generation) (LVG, 2010) annotator from 
cTAKES to retrieve normalized word forms. 

Figure 1: System Pipeline 
 

The assertion classifier uses features extracted 
by the subcomponents to represent training and test 
instances. We used LIBSVM, a library for support 
vector machines (SVM), (Chang and Lin, 2001) 
for multi-class classification with the RBF (Radial 
Basis Function) kernel. 

3.2 Original i2b2 Feature Set 
The assertion classifier that we created for the 
i2b2/VA Challenge used the features listed below, 
which we developed by manually examining the 
training data: 

Lexical Features: The medical term itself, the 
three words preceding it, and the three words fol-
lowing it. We used the LVG annotator in Lexical 
Tools (McCray et al., 1994) to normalize each 
word (e.g., with respect to case and tense). 

Syntactic Features: Part-of-speech tags of the 
three words preceding the medical term and the 
three words following it.  

312



Lexico-Syntactic Features: We also defined 
features representing words corresponding to sev-
eral parts-of-speech in the same sentence as the 
medical term. The value for each feature is the 
normalized word string. To mitigate the limited 
window size of lexical features, we defined one 
feature each for the nearest preceding and follow-
ing adjective, adverb, preposition, and verb, and 
one additional preceding adjective and preposition 
and one additional following verb and preposition. 

Contextual Features: We incorporated the 
ConText algorithm (Chapman et al., 2001) to de-
tect four contextual properties in the sentence: ab-
sent (negation), hypothetical, historical, and not 
associated with the patient. The algorithm assigns 
one of three values to each feature: true, false, or 
possible. We also created one feature to represent 
the Section Header with a string value normalized 
using (Meystre and Haug, 2005). The system only 
using contextual features gave reasonable results: 
F1-measure overall 89.96%, present 91.39%, ab-
sent 86.58%, and hypothetical 72.13%.  

Feature Pruning: We created an UNKNOWN 
feature value to cover rarely seen feature values. 
Lexical feature values that had frequency < 4 and 
other feature values that had frequency < 2 were all 
encoded as UNKNOWNs.  

3.3 New Features for Improvements 
After the i2b2/VA Challenge submission, we add-
ed the following new features, specifically to try to 
improve performance on the minority classes: 

Lexical Features: We created a second set of 
lexical features that were case-insensitive. We also 
created three additional binary features for each 
lexical feature. We computed the average tf-idf 
score for the words comprising the medical term 
itself, the average tf-idf score for the three words to 
its left, and the average tf-idf score for the three 
words to its right. Each binary feature has a value 
of true if the average tf-idf score is smaller than a 
threshold (e.g. 0.5 for the medical term itself), or 
false otherwise. Finally, we created another binary 
feature that is true if the medical term contains a 
word with a negative prefix.1 

Lexico-Syntactic Features:  We defined two 
binary features that check for the presence of a 

                                                             
1 Negative prefixes: ab, de, di, il, im, in, ir, re, un, no, mel, 
mal, mis. In retrospect, some of these are too general and 
should be tightened up in the future. 

comma or question mark adjacent to the medical 
term. We also defined features for the nearest pre-
ceding and following modal verb and wh-adverb 
(e.g., where and when). Finally, we reduced the 
scope of these features from the entire sentence to 
a context window of size eight around the medical 
term.  

Sentence Features: We created two binary fea-
tures to represent whether a sentence is long (> 50 
words) or short (<= 50 words), and whether the 
sentence contains more than 5 punctuation marks, 
primarily to identify sentences containing lists. 2 

Context Features: We created a second set of 
ConText algorithm properties for negation restrict-
ed to the six word context window around the 
medical term. According to the assertion annota-
tion guidelines, problems associated with allergies 
were defined as conditional. So we added one bi-
nary feature that is true if the section headers con-
tain terms related to allergies (e.g., “Medication 
allergies”). 

Feature Pruning: We changed the pruning 
strategy to use document frequency values instead 
of corpus frequency for the lexical features, and 
used document frequency > 1 for normalized 
words and > 2 for case-insensitive words as 
thresholds. We also removed 57 redundant in-
stances from the training set. Finally, when a med-
ical term co-exists with other medical terms (prob-
lem concepts) in the same sentence, the others are 
excluded from the lexical and lexico-syntactic fea-
tures. 

3.4 Multi-class Learning Strategies 
Our original i2b2 system used a 1-vs-1 classifica-
tion strategy. This approach creates one classifier 
for each possible pair of labels (e.g., one classifier 
decides whether an instance is present vs. absent, 
another decides whether it is present vs. condition-
al, etc.). All of the classifiers are applied to a new 
instance and the label for the instance is deter-
mined by summing the votes of the classifiers. 
However, Huang et al. (2001) reported that this 
approach did not work well for data sets that had 
highly unbalanced class probabilities.  
   Therefore we experimented with an alternative 1-
vs-all classification strategy. In this approach, we 

                                                             
2 We hoped to help the classifier recognize lists for nega-
tion scoping, although no scoping features were added per 
se.

create one classifier for each type of label using 
instances with that label as positive instances and 
instances with any other label as negative instanc-
es. The final class label is assigned by choosing the 
class that was assigned with the highest confidence 
value (i.e., the classifier’s score). 

4 Evaluation 
After changing to the 1-vs-all multi-class strategy 
and adding the new feature set, we evaluated our 
improved system on the test data and compared its 
performance with our original system. 

4.1 Data  
The training set includes 349 clinical notes, with 

11,967 assertions of medical problems. The test set 
includes 477 texts with 18,550 assertions. These 
assertions were distributed as follows (Table 1):

Present 67.28    70.22    

Absent  21.18    19.46

4.2 Results 
For the i2b2/VA Challenge submission, our system 
showed good performance, with 93.01% micro-
averaged F1-measure. However, the macro F1-
measure was much lower because our recall on the 
minority classes was weak. For example, most of 

the conditional test cases were misclassified as 
present. Table 2 shows the comparative results of 
the two systems (named ‘i2b2’ for the i2b2/VA 
Challenge system, and ‘new’ for our improved sys-
tem).

Table 2: Result Comparison of Test Data 
 
The micro-averaged F1-measure of our new system 
is 94.17%, which now outperforms the best official 
score reported for the 2010 i2b2 challenge (which 
was 93.62%). The macro-averaged F1-measure 
increased from 76.38% to 79.76% because perfor-
mance on the minority classes improved. The F1-
measure improved in all classes, but we saw espe-
cially large improvements with the possible class 
(+6.32%) and the conditional class (+8.58%). Alt-
hough the improvement on the dominant classes 
was limited in absolute terms (+.79% F1-measure 
for present and +1.86% for absent), the relative 
reduction in error rate was greater than for the mi-
nority classes: -29.25% reduction in error rate for 
absent assertions, -17.32% for present assertions, 
and -13.3% for conditional assertions.

4.3 Analysis 
We performed five-fold cross validation on the 
training data to measure the impact of each of the 
four subsets of features explained in Section 3. Ta-
ble 3 shows the cross validation results when cu-
mulatively adding each set of features. Applying 
the 1-vs-all strategy showed interesting results: 
recall went up and precision went down for all 
classes except present. Although the overall F1-
measure remained almost same, it helped to in-
crease the recall on the minority classes, and we 
were able to gain most of the precision back (with-
out sacrificing this recall) by adding the new fea-
tures.  

The new lexical features including negative pre-
fixes and binary tf-idf features primarily increased 
performance on the absent class. Using document 
frequency to prune lexical features showed small 
gains in all classes except absent. Sentence fea-
tures helped recognize hypothetical assertions, 
which often occur in relatively long sentences. 

The possible class benefitted the most from the 
new lexico-syntactic features, with a 3.38% recall 
gain. We observed that many possible concepts 
were preceded by a question mark ('?') in the train-
ing corpus. The new contextual features helped 
detect more conditional cases. Five allergy-related 
section headers (i.e. “Allergies”, “Allergies and 
Medicine Reactions”, “Allergies/Sensitivities”, 
“Allergy”, and “Medication Allergies”) were asso-
ciated with conditional assertions. Together, all 
the new features increased recall by 26.21% on the 
conditional class, 15.5% on possible, and 14.14% 
on not associated with the patient. 

5.   Conclusions  

We created a more accurate assertion classifier that 
now achieves state-of-the-art performance on as-
sertion labeling for clinical texts. We showed that 
it is possible to improve performance on recogniz-
ing minority classes by 1-vs-all strategy and richer 
features designed with the minority classes in 
mind. However, performance on the minority clas-
ses still lags behind the dominant classes, so more 
work is needed in this area.
