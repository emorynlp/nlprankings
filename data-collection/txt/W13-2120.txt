Abstract

We present the results from an elicitation
experiment in which human speakers were
asked to produced quantified referring ex-
pressions (QREs), as in ‘The crate with
10 apples’, ‘The crate with many apples’,
etc. These results suggest that some sub-
tle contextual factors govern the choice be-
tween different types of QREs, and that
numerals are highly preferred for subitiz-
able quantities despite the availability of
coarser-grained expressions.

1 Introduction

Speakers can express quantities in different ways.
For instance, a speaker may specify a meeting time
with the expression ‘in the morning’ or with the
more precise, numeric expression ‘at 10:30am’’;
she may choose to specify a temperature as ‘5 de-
grees Celsius’ or instead use the less precise but
more qualifying expression ‘cold’. One area of
NLG where these choices are important is the gen-
eration of referring expressions. In particular, a
referent may be identified by means of some quan-
titative value or other (e.g., ‘the tall man; ‘the man
who is 198cm tall’), or by means of the number
of other entities to which it is related. Hence-
forth, let’s call these quantified referring expres-
sions (QREs). An example of a QRE arises, for
instance, when a person is identified by means of
the number of his children (‘the man with 5 daugh-
ters’), when a directory is identified by means
of the number of files in it (‘the directory with
520/many PDF files in it’), or when a crate is iden-
tified by means of the number of apples in it (‘the
crate with 7 /a few apples’).

Green and van Deemter (2011) asked under
what circumstances it might be beneficial, for
a reader or hearer, for referring expressions of
this kind to contain vague expressions (e.g., like

many). The present paper addresses the same phe-
nomena focussing, more broadly, on all the differ-
ent ways in which reference may be achieved; un-
like these previous authors, we shall address this
question from the point of view of the speaker,
asking how human speakers refer in such cases,
rather than how useful a given referring expression
is to a hearer (e.g., as measured by their response
times in a manipulation task).

We start by making our research questions more
precise in the next section. We then describe the
production experiment we run online in Section 3
and present an analysis of the data in Section 4.
We end with some pointers on how our results
could inform an NLG module for QREs.

2 Research Questions

Suppose you want to point out one crate amongst
several crates with different numbers of apples.
You may use a numeral (‘the crate with seven ap-
ples’) or, if the crate in question is the one with
the largest or smallest amount of apples, you may
use superlatives (‘the crate with the most apples’),
comparatives (‘with more apples’) or vague quan-
tifiers (‘with many apples’); if your crate is the
only one with any apples in it at all, you might
simply say ‘the crate with apples’). In many situ-
ations, several of these options are applicable. It
is not obvious, however, which of these is pre-
ferred. The Gricean Maxim of Quantity (Grice,
1975) urges speakers to make their contribution as
informative as, but not more informative than, it is
required for the current purposes of the exchange.
This might be taken to predict that speakers will
tend to use the most coarsely grained expression
that identifies the referent (unless they want some
nontrivial implicatures to be inferred). This would
predict, for example that it is odd to say ‘the box
with 27 apples’ when ‘the box with apples’ suf-
fices, because the latter contains a boolean prop-
erty (contains apples), whereas the former relies

on a special case on what is essentially much more
finely grained property (contains x apples).

Our hunch, however, was that this is not the
whole story. For example, the literature on human
number processing suggests that numbers below 5
or 6 are handled almost effortlessly; these num-
bers are called subitizable (Kaufman et al., 1949)
Furthermore, we hypothesized that it matters to
what extent the number of apples in the target crate
“stands out”. We had the following expectations:

1. Speakers do not always use the coarsest-
grained level that is sufficient.

2. Whether a quantity is subitizable or not inter-
feres with the speakers’ choice.

3. The frequency of vague forms (such as ‘many’)
will be higher in contexts where the gap be-
tween the target quantity and the quantities in
the distractors is large than when it is small.1

We wanted to put these ideas to the test and, more
generally, find out how human speakers use QREs
in different contexts. Our interest was also in cre-
ating a corpus of human-produced QREs that can
serve future research.

3 Experimental Setup

The elicitation experiment was run online. Sub-
jects first encountered a screen with instructions.
They were told that they would be presented with
situations consisting of three squares, with each of
them having none, one or more shapes in it. In
each of these situations, one of the three squares
would be highlighted and subjects were asked to
describe this target square in a way that would en-
able a reader of their expression to identify it. Sub-
jects were told that the recipient of their descrip-
tion may see the three squares arranged differently
on the screen with their contents possibly being
scrambled around. That is, they were indirectly
asked to concentrate on the quantity of shapes in

term used to describe the vague, unmodified form of relative
scalar adjectives (e.g., tall) as opposed to their comparative
(taller) and superlative (tallest) forms.

the squares (rather than on their relative position or
on the spatial configuration of the shapes in them).
Figure 1 shows some sample stimuli.

The experiment included a total of 20 items,
generated according to the following parameters:

• Subitizability: the amount of shapes in the tar-
get is within the subitizable range (SR) (1-4
shapes) or within a non-subitizable range (NR);
we included three non-subitizable ranges, with
around 10, 20, and 30 shapes, respectively.

• Context: we considered four types of scenarios:

1. X : only the target square is filled.
2. XY : two squares are filled.
3. XYY: all squares filled; with two ranges.
4. XYZ: all squares filled; with three ranges.

The symbol X in the first position stands for the
referent square, while the symbols in the other
two positions indicate for each of the other two
squares whether it contains a number of shapes
within the same range as the referent square
(X), within a different range (Y/Z), or whether
it does not contain any shapes at all ( ).

• Relative Size: the target contains either the
smallest or the largest amount of shapes.

• Gap Size: there is either a big or a small quan-
tity difference between the target and other
squares. A big gap size is only possible with
target squares that contain the largest amount of
shapes within a non-subitizable range and those
that contain the smallest amount of shapes
within a subitizable range.

Participants were recruited by publishing a call
in the Linguist List. A total of 82 subjects par-
ticipated in the experiment, including participants
who only responded to some items. We eliminated
6 sessions where the participant had responded to
less than 10 items. The final dataset includes 76
participants and a total of 1508 descriptions.

4 Results

Each description produced by the participants was
annotated with one of the categories in Table 1.

Category Examples
ABS [absolute] the one with pacmans / the square that’s not blank
BASE [base] the square with lots of dark dashes / it has a few crosses in it
COMP [comparative] the one with fewer dashes / the square with more crosses in it
NUM [numeric] the square with 11 black dots / 3 grey ovals
SUP [superlative] it has the largest number of purple squares / the square with the least minuses
OTH [other] about a dozen blue diamonds / big droup of circles in the centre

Table 1: Categories used to code the expressions produced by the participants.

The classification was first done automatically by
pattern matching and then revised manually.

To analyse the data, we used mixed-effects lo-
gistic regression with crossed random effects for
subjects and items (Baayen et al., 2008). All
models had by-subject and by-item random in-
tercepts, and by-subject random slopes for the
within-subject factors of context and range (subiti-
zability). The models were fit using maximum
likelihood estimation with p-values derived from
likelihood ratio tests. Model estimation was per-
formed using the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2013)
of R statistical software (R Core Team, 2013).

Table 2 shows the overall distribution of expres-
sion types used by the participants. As can be
seen, numerical expressions were the most com-
mon type of expression used overall (65%). We
found, however, that there was a strong subiti-
zability effect in the use of these expressions:
for non-subitizable targets, subjects used numer-
ical expressions only 39% of the time, while for
subitizable targets they did so 90% of the time.
This main effect of subitizability was significant
(χ2(1) = 47.92, p < .001). There was high
variability across subjects in the effect (χ2(1) =
25.00, p < .001), with a higher rate of numeri-
cal expressions associated with a smaller effect of
subitizability (r = −.61). Note that 17 of the 82
subjects (∼ 20%) always used numerical expres-
sions, even when the target was not subitizable. Of
the remaining 65 subjects, 64 show a very signif-
icant preference for using numeric expressions to
describe targets within the subitizable range.

types for each type of context and subitizabil-

ity condition.2 Sensitivity to context differed for
subitizable and non-subitizable targets, supported
by a reliable interaction between these factors
(χ2(1) = 17.31, p < .001). Despite the strong
overall preference for numerical expressions with
subitizable targets, the effect of context was still
reliable (χ2(1) = 22.63, p < .001). For subiti-
zable targets (Figure 2, bottom row), numeric ex-
pressions were almost always used (96%) except
in contexts where the target was the only filled
square (X ). In this context, participants occa-
sionally used absolute expressions instead (e.g. the
one with shapes) 33% of the time. In sum, subiti-
zable targets overwhelmingly triggered the use of
numerals, predominating even when a Gricean ac-
count would prefer coarser-grained expressions.

For non-subitizable targets (first row of plots
in Figure 2), in contexts without distractors (X )
absolute expressions were preferred over numer-
ical ones; this differed from the behaviour of
subitizable targets in this context, where numer-
ical expressions predominated (χ2(1) = 4.25,
p = .039). In contexts with non-empty distrac-
tors (XY , XYY, and XYZ), expressions other than
numeric are used significantly more often than
they were for subitizable targets (χ2(1) = 52.93,
p < .001). Superlative expressions (e.g. the
square with the least dots) were preferred in con-
texts where the three squares were filled (χ2(1) =
7.74, p = .005). In contexts with one distractor
(XY ), superlatives were also rather common, and
comparative expressions (e.g. the one with fewer
dashes) occurred at higher rates than in other types
of context (χ2(1) = 42.34, p < .001).

The comparison between the contexts with two
distractors (XYY and XYZ) suggests that they dif-
fered largely in the use of vague expressions
(BASE; e.g. the one with many diamonds), which
had a higher rate in context XYY where there
were only two quantity ranges (χ2(1) = 5.01,

p = .025). For this context we also found an ef-
fect of gap size (see Figure 3): the relative odds
of choosing a vague expression over a numeric or
superlative one is significantly higher when there
is a big difference between the target quantity and
the distractor quantities (χ2(1) = 5.68, p = .017);
that is, when the chance of there being borderline
cases is reduced. A small gap between the quanti-
ties makes the preference for superlative (and thus
non-vague) expressions stronger.

5 Conclusions

In line with our expectations (see Section 2), our
data are not easy to reconcile with the type of
Gricean account that predicts a preference for the
most coarsely grained QRE that identifies the tar-
get. The most obvious deviation from this Gricean
account arises from the subitizable items in our
study, where numerical expressions turned out to
be much preferred over other QREs. The natu-
ral explanation seems to be that such expressions
come naturally to speakers (and to hearers too as

shown by Green and van Deemter (2011)). In
other words, our study suggests an intriguing vari-
ant on Grice, in which the most relevant factor is
not one of informativeness – as Grice’s writings
suggest – but one of effort. It suggests that speak-
ers tend to produce expressions that identify the
referent with least effort.

Our expectation 3 was also confirmed: vague
forms (BASE) are more frequent with big gap
sizes, although they are not produced with high
frequency. (The same pattern of results was found
by van Deemter (2004)). Thus, in the scenarios
we considered vague QREs are never the most
favoured option. The high frequency of superla-
tives over comparatives is also noteworthy. Com-
paratives are used very seldom overall but are
more frequent in contexts with only one distractor
(XY ). This indicates that some speakers opt for
a less strong expression than a superlative (an ex-
pression that means more than x rather than more
than any other x) in contexts where this does not
lead to ambiguity. However, numerals and su-
perlatives are still largely preferred in those con-
texts.

These observations suggest that a given type of
situation (i.e., a given context + subitizability con-
dition) should not always map to the same type of
QRE. If human QRE behaviour is to be mimicked,
the best approach seems to be to use a stochastic
NLG program that seeks to replicate the frequen-
cies that are found in human usage.
