Abstract

We present persona-based models for han-
dling the issue of speaker consistency in
neural response generation. A speaker
model encodes personas in distributed em-
beddings that capture individual charac-
teristics such as background information
and speaking style. A dyadic speaker-
addressee model captures properties of in-
teractions between two interlocutors. Our
models yield qualitative performance im-
provements in both perplexity and BLEU
scores over baseline sequence-to-sequence
models, with similar gains in speaker con-
sistency as measured by human judges.

1 Introduction

As conversational agents gain traction as user in-
terfaces, there has been growing research inter-
est in training naturalistic conversation systems
from large volumes of human-to-human interac-
tions (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al., 2015;
Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2016). One major is-
sue for these data-driven systems is their propensity
to select the response with greatest likelihood—in
effect a consensus response of the humans repre-
sented in the training data. Outputs are frequently
vague or non-committal (Li et al., 2016), and when
not, they can be wildly inconsistent, as illustrated
in Table 1.

In this paper, we address the challenge of consis-
tency and how to endow data-driven systems with
the coherent “persona” needed to model human-
like behavior, whether as personal assistants, per-

sonalized avatar-like agents, or game characters.1

For present purposes, we will define PERSONA
as the character that an artificial agent, as actor,
plays or performs during conversational interac-
tions. A persona can be viewed as a composite
of elements of identity (background facts or user
profile), language behavior, and interaction style.
A persona is also adaptive, since an agent may
need to present different facets to different human
interlocutors depending on the interaction.

Fortunately, neural models of conversation gen-
eration (Sordoni et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015;
Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2016) provide a
straightforward mechanism for incorporating per-
sonas as embeddings. We therefore explore two per-

personality makes it impossible for current systems to pass

sona models, a single-speaker SPEAKER MODEL
and a dyadic SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE MODEL,
within a sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ) frame-
work (Sutskever et al., 2014). The Speaker Model
integrates a speaker-level vector representation into
the target part of the SEQ2SEQ model. Analo-
gously, the Speaker-Addressee model encodes the
interaction patterns of two interlocutors by con-
structing an interaction representation from their
individual embeddings and incorporating it into
the SEQ2SEQ model. These persona vectors are
trained on human-human conversation data and
used at test time to generate personalized responses.
Our experiments on an open-domain corpus of
Twitter conversations and dialog datasets compris-
ing TV series scripts show that leveraging persona
vectors can improve relative performance up to
20% in BLEU score and 12% in perplexity, with
a commensurate gain in consistency as judged by
human annotators.

2 Related Work

This work follows the line of investigation initiated
by Ritter et al. (2011) who treat generation of con-
versational dialog as a statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) problem. Ritter et al. (2011) represents
a break with previous and contemporaneous dialog
work that relies extensively on hand-coded rules,
typically either building statistical models on top
of heuristic rules or templates (Levin et al., 2000;
Young et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2003; Pieraccini
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) or learning genera-
tion rules from a minimal set of authored rules or
labels (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 2002;
Banchs and Li, 2012; Ameixa et al., 2014; Nio et
al., 2014; Chen et al., 2013). More recently (Wen
et al., 2015) have used a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to
learn from unaligned data in order to reduce the
heuristic space of sentence planning and surface
realization.

The SMT model proposed by Ritter et al., on
the other hand, is end-to-end, purely data-driven,
and contains no explicit model of dialog structure;
the model learns to converse from human-to-human
conversational corpora. Progress in SMT stemming
from the use of neural language models (Sutskever
et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015;
Luong et al., 2015) has inspired efforts to extend
these neural techniques to SMT-based conversa-
tional response generation. Sordoni et al. (2015)
augments Ritter et al. (2011) by rescoring out-

puts using a SEQ2SEQ model conditioned on con-
versation history. Other researchers have recently
used SEQ2SEQ to directly generate responses in an
end-to-end fashion without relying on SMT phrase
tables (Serban et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015;
Vinyals and Le, 2015). Serban et al. (2015) propose
a hierarchical neural model aimed at capturing de-
pendencies over an extended conversation history.
Recent work by Li et al. (2016) measures mutual
information between message and response in or-
der to reduce the proportion of generic responses
typical of SEQ2SEQ systems. Yao et al. (2015) em-
ploy an intention network to maintain the relevance
of responses.

Modeling of users and speakers has been exten-
sively studied within the standard dialog model-
ing framework (e.g., (Wahlster and Kobsa, 1989;
Kobsa, 1990; Schatztnann et al., 2005; Lin and
Walker, 2011)). Since generating meaningful re-
sponses in an open-domain scenario is intrinsi-
cally difficult in conventional dialog systems, ex-
isting models often focus on generalizing character
style on the basis of qualitative statistical analysis
(Walker et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2011). The
present work, by contrast, is in the vein of the
SEQ2SEQ models of Vinyals and Le (2015) and Li
et al. (2016), enriching these models by training
persona vectors directly from conversational data
and relevant side-information, and incorporating
these directly into the decoder.

3 Sequence-to-Sequence Models

Given a sequence of inputs X = {x1, x2, ..., xnX},
an LSTM associates each time step with an input
gate, a memory gate and an output gate, respec-
tively denoted as it, ft and ot. We distinguish e
and h where et denotes the vector for an individual
text unit (for example, a word or sentence) at time
step t while ht denotes the vector computed by the
LSTM model at time t by combining et and ht−1.
ct is the cell state vector at time t, and σ denotes the
sigmoid function. Then, the vector representation
ht for each time step t is given by:

ct = ft · ct−1 + it · lt (2)

hst = ot · tanh(ct) (3)

where Wi, Wf , Wo, Wl ∈ RK×2K . In
SEQ2SEQ generation tasks, each input X is paired
with a sequence of outputs to predict: Y =
{y1, y2, ..., ynY }. The LSTM defines a distribu-
tion over outputs and sequentially predicts tokens
using a softmax function:

p(Y |X) =
ny∏
t=1

p(yt|x1, x2, ..., xt, y1, y2, ..., yt−1)

=
ny∏
t=1

exp(f(ht−1, eyt))∑
y′ exp(f(ht−1, ey′))

where f(ht−1, eyt) denotes the activation function
between ht−1 and eyt . Each sentence terminates
with a special end-of-sentence symbol EOS. In
keeping with common practices, inputs and out-
puts use different LSTMs with separate parameters
to capture different compositional patterns.

During decoding, the algorithm terminates when
an EOS token is predicted. At each time step, either
a greedy approach or beam search can be adopted
for word prediction.

4 Personalized Response Generation

Our work introduces two persona-based models:
the Speaker Model, which models the personal-
ity of the respondent, and the Speaker-Addressee
Model which models the way the respondent adapts
their speech to a given addressee — a linguistic phe-
nomenon known as lexical entrainment (Deutsch
and Pechmann, 1982).

4.1 Notation
For the response generation task, let M de-
note the input word sequence (message) M =
{m1,m2, ...,mI}. R denotes the word sequence in
response to M , where R = {r1, r2, ..., rJ , EOS}
and J is the length of the response (terminated
by an EOS token). rt denotes a word token that
is associated with a K dimensional distinct word
embedding et. V is the vocabulary size.

4.2 Speaker Model
Our first model is the Speaker Model, which mod-
els the respondent alone. This model represents
each individual speaker as a vector or embedding,
which encodes speaker-specific information (e.g.,
dialect, register, age, gender, personal informa-
tion) that influences the content and style of her
responses. Note that these attributes are not ex-
plicitly annotated, which would be tremendously

expensive for our datasets. Instead, our model man-
ages to cluster users along some of these traits (e.g.,
age, country of residence) based on the responses
alone.

Figure 1 gives a brief illustration of the Speaker
Model. Each speaker i ∈ [1, N ] is associated with
a user-level representation vi ∈ RK×1. As in stan-
dard SEQ2SEQ models, we first encode message
S into a vector representation hS using the source
LSTM. Then for each step in the target side, hidden
units are obtained by combining the representation
produced by the target LSTM at the previous time
step, the word representations at the current time
step, and the speaker embedding vi:

 ht−1est

vi

 (4)
ct = ft · ct−1 + it · lt (5)
hst = ot · tanh(ct) (6)

whereW ∈ R4K×3K . In this way, speaker informa-
tion is encoded and injected into the hidden layer at
each time step and thus helps predict personalized
responses throughout the generation process. The
Speaker embedding {vi} is shared across all con-
versations that involve speaker i. {vi} are learned
by back propagating word prediction errors to each
neural component during training.

Another useful property of this model is that it
helps infer answers to questions even if the evi-
dence is not readily present in the training set. This
is important as the training data does not contain ex-
plicit information about every attribute of each user
(e.g., gender, age, country of residence). The model
learns speaker representations based on conversa-
tional content produced by different speakers, and
speakers producing similar responses tend to have
similar embeddings, occupying nearby positions
in the vector space. This way, the training data of
speakers nearby in vector space help increase the
generalization capability of the speaker model. For
example, consider two speakers i and j who sound
distinctly British, and who are therefore close in
speaker embedding space. Now, suppose that, in
the training data, speaker i was asked Where do
you live? and responded in the UK. Even if speaker
j was never asked the same question, this answer
can help influence a good response from speaker
j, and this without explicitly labeled geo-location
information.

Figure 1: Illustrative example of the Speaker Model introduced in this work. Speaker IDs close in embedding space tend to
respond in the same manner. These speaker embeddings are learned jointly with word embeddings and all other parameters of
the neural model via backpropagation. In this example, say Rob is a speaker clustered with people who often mention England
in the training data, then the generation of the token ‘england’ at time t = 2 would be much more likely than that of ‘u.s.’. A
non-persona model would prefer generating in the u.s. if ‘u.s.’ is more represented in the training data across all speakers.

4.3 Speaker-Addressee Model

A natural extension of the Speaker Model is a
model that is sensitive to speaker-addressee inter-
action patterns within the conversation. Indeed,
speaking style, register, and content does not vary
only with the identity of the speaker, but also with
that of the addressee. For example, in scripts for
the TV series Friends used in some of our exper-
iments, the character Ross often talks differently
to his sister Monica than to Rachel, with whom
he is engaged in an on-again off-again relationship
throughout the series.

The proposed Speaker-Addressee Model oper-
ates as follows: We wish to predict how speaker i
would respond to a message produced by speaker j.
Similarly to the Speaker model, we associate each
speaker with a K dimensional speaker-level repre-
sentation, namely vi for user i and vj for user j. We
obtain an interactive representation Vi,j ∈ RK×1
by linearly combining user vectors vi and vj in
an attempt to model the interactive style of user i
towards user j,

Vi,j = tanh(W1 · vi +W2 · v2) (7)

where W1,W2 ∈ RK×K . Vi,j is then linearly in-
corporated into LSTM models at each step in the
target: 

 =

W ·
 ht−1est

Vi,j

 (8)

ct = ft · ct−1 + it · lt (9)
hst = ot · tanh(ct) (10)

Vi,j depends on both speaker and addressee and
the same speaker will thus respond differently to
a message from different interlocutors. One po-
tential issue with Speaker-Addressee modelling is
the difficulty involved in collecting a large-scale
training dataset in which each speaker is involved
in conversation with a wide variety of people.
Like the Speaker Model, however, the Speaker-
Addressee Model derives generalization capabil-
ities from speaker embeddings. Even if the two
speakers at test time (i and j) were never involved
in the same conversation in the training data, two
speakers i′ and j′ who are respectively close in
embeddings may have been, and this can help mod-
elling how i should respond to j.

4.4 Decoding and Reranking
For decoding, the N-best lists are generated us-
ing the decoder with beam size B = 200. We set a
maximum length of 20 for the generated candidates.
Decoding operates as follows: At each time step,
we first examine allB ×B possible next-word can-
didates, and add all hypothesis ending with an EOS
token to the N-best list. We then preserve the top-B
unfinished hypotheses and move to the next word
position.

To deal with the issue that SEQ2SEQ models
tend to generate generic and commonplace re-
sponses such as I don’t know, we follow Li et al.
(2016) by reranking the generated N-best list using

997



a scoring function that linearly combines a length
penalty and the log likelihood of the source given
the target:

log p(R|M,v) + λ log p(M |R) + γ|R| (11)

where p(R|M, v) denotes the probability of the
generated response given the message M and the
respondent’s speaker ID. |R| denotes the length
of the target and γ denotes the associated penalty
weight. We optimize γ and λ on N-best lists of
response candidates generated from the develop-
ment set using MERT (Och, 2003) by optimizing
BLEU. To compute p(M |R), we train an inverse
SEQ2SEQ model by swapping messages and re-
sponses. We trained standard SEQ2SEQ models for
p(M |R) with no speaker information considered.
5 Datasets

5.1 Twitter Persona Dataset
Data Collection Training data for the Speaker
Model was extracted from the Twitter FireHose for
the six-month period beginning January 1, 2012.
We limited the sequences to those where the respon-
ders had engaged in at least 60 (and at most 300)
3-turn conversational interactions during the period,
in other words, users who reasonably frequently en-
gaged in conversation. This yielded a set of 74,003
users who took part in a minimum of 60 and a max-
imum of 164 conversational turns (average: 92.24,
median: 90). The dataset extracted using responses
by these “conversationalists” contained 24,725,711
3-turn sliding-window (context-message-response)
conversational sequences.

In addition, we sampled 12000 3-turn conversa-
tions from the same user set from the Twitter Fire-
Hose for the three-month period beginning July 1,
2012, and set these aside as development, valida-
tion, and test sets (4000 conversational sequences
each). Note that development, validation, and test
sets for this data are single-reference, which is by
design. Multiple reference responses would typ-
ically require acquiring responses from different
people, which would confound different personas.

Training Protocols We trained four-layer
SEQ2SEQ models on the Twitter corpus following
the approach of (Sutskever et al., 2014). Details
are as follows:

• 4 layer LSTM models with 1,000 hidden cells
for each layer.
• Batch size is set to 128.

• Learning rate is set to 1.0.
• Parameters are initialized by sampling from

the uniform distribution [−0.1, 0.1].
• Gradients are clipped to avoid gradient explo-

sion with a threshold of 5.
• Vocabulary size is limited to 50,000.
• Dropout rate is set to 0.2.

Source and target LSTMs use different sets of pa-
rameters. We ran 14 epochs, and training took
roughly a month to finish on a Tesla K40 GPU
machine.

As only speaker IDs of responses were specified
when compiling the Twitter dataset, experiments
on this dataset were limited to the Speaker Model.

5.2 Twitter Sordoni Dataset
The Twitter Persona Dataset was collected for this
paper for experiments with speaker ID informa-
tion. To obtain a point of comparison with prior
state-of-the-art work (Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et
al., 2016), we measure our baseline (non-persona)
LSTM model against prior work on the dataset
of (Sordoni et al., 2015), which we call the Twit-
ter Sordoni Dataset. We only use its test-set por-
tion, which contains responses for 2114 context
and messages. It is important to note that the Sor-
doni dataset offers up to 10 references per message,
while the Twitter Persona dataset has only 1 refer-
ence per message. Thus BLEU scores cannot be
compared across the two Twitter datasets (BLEU
scores on 10 references are generally much higher
than with 1 reference). Details of this dataset are
in (Sordoni et al., 2015).

5.3 Television Series Transcripts
Data Collection For the dyadic Speaker-
Addressee Model we used scripts from the
American television comedies Friends2 and The
Big Bang Theory,3 available from Internet Movie
Script Database (IMSDb).4 We collected 13
main characters from the two series in a corpus
of 69,565 turns. We split the corpus into train-
ing/development/testing sets, with development
and testing sets each of about 2,000 turns.

Training Since the relatively small size of the
dataset does not allow for training an open domain
dialog model, we adopted a domain adaption strat-
egy where we first trained a standard SEQ2SEQ

We contrast our baseline against an SMT baseline (Ritter et al.,

computed in a leave-one-out fashion, having one less reference
available. We nevertheless provide this result to give a sense
that these BLEU scores of 5-6% are not unreasonable.

models using a much larger OpenSubtitles (OSDb)
dataset (Tiedemann, 2009), and then adapting the
pre-trained model to the TV series dataset.

The OSDb dataset is a large, noisy, open-domain
dataset containing roughly 60M-70M scripted lines
spoken by movie characters. This dataset does not
specify which character speaks each subtitle line,
which prevents us from inferring speaker turns. Fol-
lowing Vinyals et al. (2015), we make the simplify-
ing assumption that each line of subtitle constitutes
a full speaker turn.5 We trained standard SEQ2SEQ
models on OSDb dataset, following the protocols
already described in Section 5.1. We run 10 itera-
tions over the training set.

We initialize word embeddings and LSTM pa-
rameters in the Speaker Model and the Speaker-
Addressee model using parameters learned from
OpenSubtitles datasets. User embeddings are ran-
domly initialized from [−0.1, 0.1]. We then ran 5
additional epochs until the perplexity on the devel-
opment set stabilized.

6 Experiments

6.1 Evaluation

Following (Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016)
we used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for parame-
ter tuning and evaluation. BLEU has been shown
to correlate well with human judgment on the re-
sponse generation task, as demonstrated in (Galley
et al., 2015). Besides BLEU scores, we also report
perplexity as an indicator of model capability.

6.2 Baseline

Since our main experiments are with a new dataset
(the Twitter Persona Dataset), we first show that
our LSTM baseline is competitive with the state-of-

not necessarily from the same scene or two different speakers.

the-art (Li et al., 2016) on an established dataset,
the Twitter Sordoni Dataset (Sordoni et al., 2015).
Our baseline is simply our implementation of the
LSTM-MMI of (Li et al., 2016), so results should
be relatively close to their reported results. Table 2
summarizes our results against prior work. We see
that our system actually does better than (Li et al.,
2016), and we attribute the improvement to a larger
training corpus, the use of dropout during training,
and possibly to the “conversationalist” nature of
our corpus.

6.3 Results

We first report performance on the Twitter Persona
dataset. Perplexity is reported in Table 3. We ob-
serve about a 10% decrease in perplexity for the
Speaker model over the standard SEQ2SEQ model.
In terms of BLEU scores (Table 4), a significant per-
formance boost is observed for the Speaker model
over the standard SEQ2SEQ model, yielding an in-
crease of 21% in the maximum likelihood (MLE)
setting and 11.7% for mutual information setting
(MMI). In line with findings in (Li et al., 2016), we
observe a consistent performance boost introduced
by the MMI objective function over a standard
SEQ2SEQ model based on the MLE objective func-
tion. It is worth noting that our persona models
are more beneficial to the MLE models than to the
MMI models. This result is intuitive as the persona
models help make Standard LSTM MLE outputs
more informative and less bland, and thus make the
use of MMI less critical.

For the TV Series dataset, perplexity and BLEU
scores are respectively reported in Table 5 and Ta-
ble 6. As can be seen, the Speaker and Speaker-
Addressee models respectively achieve perplexity
values of 25.4 and 25.0 on the TV-series dataset,

7.0% and 8.4% percent lower than the correspon-
dent standard SEQ2SEQ models. In terms of BLEU
score, we observe a similar performance boost
as on the Twitter dataset, in which the Speaker
model and the Speaker-Addressee model outper-
form the standard SEQ2SEQ model by 13.7% and
10.6%. By comparing the Speaker-Addressee
model against the Speaker model on the TV Se-
ries dataset, we do not observe a significant dif-
ference. We suspect that this is primarily due to
the relatively small size of the dataset where the
interactive patterns might not be fully captured.
Smaller values of perplexity are observed for the
Television Series dataset than the Twitter dataset,
the perplexity of which is over 40, presumably due
to the noisier nature of Twitter dialogues.

6.4 Qualitative Analysis

Diverse Responses by Different Speakers Ta-
ble 7 represents responses generated by persona
models in response to three different input ques-
tions. We randomly selected 10 speakers (without
cherry-picking) from the original Twitter dataset.
We collected their user level representations from
a speaker look-up table and integrated them into
the decoding models. The model tends to generate
specific responses for different people in response
to the factual questions.6

Table 8 shows responses generated from the
Speaker-Addressee Model using the TV-series
dataset. Interestingly, we regularly observe that
this model is sensitive to the identity of the ad-
dressee, generating words specifically targeted at
that addressee (e.g., her name). For example, the
model produces Of course, I love you, Emily in
response to an input from Emily. Also, the model
generates Of course I love you. ( kisses him), where
the pronoun “him” accurately identifies the gender
of the addressee.

that favors British users.

Human Evaluation We conducted a human eval-
uation of outputs from the Speaker Model, using
a crowdsourcing service. Since we cannot expect
crowdsourced human judges to know or attempt to
learn the ground truth of Twitter users who are not
well-known public figures, we designed our experi-
ment to evaluate the consistency of outputs associ-
ated with the speaker IDs. To this end, we collected
24 pairs of questions for which we would expect

responses to be consistent if the persona model is
coherent. For example, responses to the questions
What country do you live in? and What city do you
live in? would be considered consistent if the an-
swers were England and London respectively, but
not if they were UK and Chicago. Similarly, the
responses to Are you vegan or vegetarian? and Do
you eat beef? are consistent if the answers gener-
ated are vegan and absolutely not, but not if they
are vegan and I love beef. We collected 20 pairs of
outputs for randomly-selected personas provided
by the Speaker Model for each question pair (480
response pairs total). We also obtained the corre-
sponding outputs from the baseline MMI-enhanced
SEQ2SEQ system.

Since our purpose is to measure the gain in con-
sistency over the baseline system, we presented the
pairs of answers system-pairwise, i.e., 4 responses,
2 from each system, displayed on the screen, and
asked judges to decide which of the two systems
was more consistent. The position in which the
system pairs were presented on the screen was ran-
domized. The two systems were judged on 5-point
zero-sum scale, assigning a score of 2 (-2) if one
system was judged more (less) consistent than the
other, and 1 (-1) if one was rated “somewhat” more
(less) consistent. Ties were assigned a score of zero.
Five judges rated each pair and their scores were
averaged and remapped into 5 equal-width bins.
After discarding ties, we found the persona model
was judged either “more consistent” or “somewhat
more consistent” in 56.7% of cases. If we ignore
the “somewhat more consistent” judgments, the
persona model wins in 6.1% of cases, compared

with only 1.6% for the baseline model. It should
be emphasized that the baseline model is a strong
baseline, since it represents the consensus of all
70K Twitter users in the dataset7.

Table 9 illustrates how consistency is an emer-
gent property of two arbitrarily selected users. The
model is capable of discovering the relations be-
tween different categories of location such as Lon-
don and the UK, Jakarta and Indonesia. However,
the model also makes inconsistent response de-
cisions, generating different answers in the sec-
ond example in response to questions asking about
age or major. Our proposed persona models inte-
grate user embeddings into the LSTM, and thus
can be viewed as encapsulating a trade-off between
a persona-specific generation model and a general
conversational model.

7I’m not pregnant is an excellent consensus answer to the
question Are you pregnant?, while I’m pregnant is consistent
as a response only in the case of someone who also answers
the question Are you a guy or a girl? with something in the
vein of I’m a girl.

7 Conclusions

We have presented two persona-based response
generation models for open-domain conversation
generation. There are many other dimensions of
speaker behavior, such as mood and emotion, that
are beyond the scope of the current paper and must
be left to future work.

Although the gains presented by our new mod-
els are not spectacular, the systems outperform our
baseline SEQ2SEQ systems in terms of BLEU, per-
plexity, and human judgments of speaker consis-
tency. We have demonstrated that by encoding
personas in distributed representations, we are able
to capture personal characteristics such as speaking
style and background information. In the Speaker-
Addressee model, moreover, the evidence suggests
that there is benefit in capturing dyadic interactions.

Our ultimate goal is to be able to take the pro-
file of an arbitrary individual whose identity is
not known in advance, and generate conversations
that accurately emulate that individual’s persona
in terms of linguistic response behavior and other
salient characteristics. Such a capability will dra-
matically change the ways in which we interact
with dialog agents of all kinds, opening up rich
new possibilities for user interfaces. Given a suffi-
ciently large training corpus in which a sufficiently
rich variety of speakers is represented, this objec-
tive does not seem too far-fetched.
