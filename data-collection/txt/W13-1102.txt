Abstract

Does phonological variation get transcribed
into social media text? This paper investigates
examples of the phonological variable of con-
sonant cluster reduction in Twitter. Not only
does this variable appear frequently, but it dis-
plays the same sensitivity to linguistic context
as in spoken language. This suggests that when
social media writing transcribes phonological
properties of speech, it is not merely a case of
inventing orthographic transcriptions. Rather,
social media displays influence from structural
properties of the phonological system.

1 Introduction

The differences between social media text and other
forms of written language are a subject of increas-
ing interest for both language technology (Gimpel
et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2011)
and linguistics (Androutsopoulos, 2011; Dresner and
Herring, 2010; Paolillo, 1996). Many words that
are endogenous to social media have been linked
with specific geographical regions (Eisenstein et al.,
2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011) and demographic
groups (Argamon et al., 2007; Rao et al., 2010; Eisen-
stein et al., 2011), raising the question of whether
this variation is related to spoken language dialects.
Dialect variation encompasses differences at multi-
ple linguistic levels, including the lexicon, morphol-
ogy, syntax, and phonology. While previous work
on group differences in social media language has
generally focused on lexical differences, this paper
considers the most purely “spoken” aspect of dialect:
phonology.

Specifically, this paper presents evidence against
the following two null hypotheses:

• H0: Phonological variation does not impact so-
cial media text.

• H1: Phonological variation may introduce new
lexical items into social media text, but not the
underlying structural rules.

These hypotheses are examined in the context of
the phonological variable of consonant cluster reduc-
tion (also known as consonant cluster simplification,
or more specifically, -/t,d/ deletion). When a word
ends in cluster of consonant sounds — for exam-
ple, mist or missed — the cluster may be simplified,
for example, to miss. This well-studied variable has
been demonstrated in a number of different English
dialects, including African American English (Labov
et al., 1968; Green, 2002), Tejano and Chicano En-
glish (Bayley, 1994; Santa Ana, 1991), and British
English (Tagliamonte and Temple, 2005); it has also
been identified in other languages, such as Quebe-
cois French (Côté, 2004). While some previous work
has cast doubt on the influence of spoken dialects on
written language (Whiteman, 1982; Thompson et al.,
2004), this paper presents large-scale evidence for
consonant cluster reduction in social media text from
Twitter — in contradiction of the null hypothesis H0.

But even if social media authors introduce new
orthographic transcriptions to capture the sound of
language in the dialect that they speak, such innova-
tions may be purely lexical. Phonological variation
is governed by a network of interacting preferences
that include the surrounding linguistic context. Do

11



these structural aspects of phonological variation also
appear in written social media?

Consonant cluster reduction is a classic example
of the complex workings of phonological variation:
its frequency depends on the morphology of the word
in which it appears, as well as the phonology of the
preceding and subsequent segments. The variable
is therefore a standard test case for models of the
interaction between phonological preferences (Guy,
1991). For our purposes, the key point is that con-
sonant cluster reduction is strongly inhibited when
the subsequent phonological segment begins with a
vowel. The final t in left is more likely to be deleted
in I left the house than in I left a tip. Guy (1991)
writes, “prior studies are unanimous that a following
consonant promotes deletion more readily than a fol-
lowing vowel,” and more recent work continues to
uphold this finding (Tagliamonte and Temple, 2005).

Consonant cluster reduction thus provides an op-
portunity to test the null hypothesis H1. If the intro-
duction of phonological variation into social media
writing occurs only on the level of new lexical items,
that would predict that reduced consonant clusters
would be followed by consonant-initial and vowel-
initial segments at roughly equal rates. But if conso-
nant cluster reduction is inhibited by adjacent vowel-
initial segments in social media text, that would argue
against H1. The experiments in this paper provide ev-
idence of such context-sensitivity, suggesting that the
influence of phonological variation on social media
text must be deeper than the transcription of invidual
lexical items.

2 Word pairs

The following word pairs were considered:

• left / lef
• just / jus
• with / wit
• going / goin
• doing / doin
• know / kno

The first two pairs display consonant cluster re-
duction, specifically t-deletion. As mentioned above,
consonant cluster reduction is a property of African
American English (AAE) and several other English

dialects. The pair with/wit represents a stopping
of the interdental fricative, a characteristic of New
York English (Gordon, 2004), rural Southern En-
glish (Thomas, 2004), as well as AAE (Green, 2002).
The next two pairs represent “g-dropping”, the re-
placement of the velar nasal with the coronal nasal,
which has been associated with informal speech in
many parts of the English-speaking world.1 The final
word pair know/kno does not differ in pronunciation,
and is included as a control.

These pairs were selected because they are all
frequently-used words, and because they cover a
range of typical “shortenings” in social media and
other computer mediated communication (Gouws et
al., 2011). Another criterion is that each shortened
form can be recognized relatively unambiguously.
Although wit and wan are standard English words,
close examination of the data did not reveal any ex-
amples in which the surface forms could be construed
to indicate these words. Other words were rejected
for this reason: for example, best may be reduced
to bes, but this surface form is frequently used as an
acronym for Blackberry Enterprise Server.

Consonant cluster reduction may be combined
with morphosyntactic variation, particularly in
African American English. Thompson et al. (2004)
describe several such cases: zero past tense (mother
kiss(ed) them all goodbye), zero plural (the children
made their bed(s)), and subject-verb agreement (then
she jump(s) on the roof ). In each of these cases, it is
unclear whether it is the morphosyntactic or phono-
logical process that is responsible for the absence of
the final consonant. Words that feature such ambigu-
ity, such as past, were avoided.

Table 1 shows five randomly sampled examples
of each shortened form. Only the relevant portion
of each message is shown. From consideration of
many examples such as these, it is clear that the
shortened forms lef, jus, wit, goin, doin, kno refer to
the standard forms left, just, with, going, doing, know
in the overwhelming majority of cases.

3 Data

Our research is supported by a dataset of microblog
posts from the social media service Twitter. This ser-
vice allows its users to post 140-character messages.
Each author’s messages appear in the newsfeeds of
individuals who have chosen to “follow” the author,
though by default the messages are publicly available
to anyone on the Internet. Twitter has relatively broad
penetration across different ethnicities, genders, and
income levels. The Pew Research Center has repeat-
edly polled the demographics of Twitter (Smith and
Brewer, 2012), finding: nearly identical usage among
women (15% of female internet users are on Twit-
ter) and men (14%); high usage among non-Hispanic
Blacks (28%); an even distribution across income and
education levels; higher usage among young adults
(26% for ages 18-29, 4% for ages 65+).

Twitter’s streaming API delivers an ongoing ran-
dom sample of messages from the complete set of
public messages on the service. The data in this
study was gathered from the public “Gardenhose”
feed, which is claimed to be approximately 10% of
all public posts; however, recent research suggests
that the sampling rate for geolocated posts is much
higher (Morstatter et al., 2013). This data was gath-
ered over a period from August 2009 through the
end of September 2012, resulting in a total of 114
million messages from 2.77 million different user
accounts (Eisenstein et al., 2012).

Several filters were applied to ensure that the
dataset is appropriate for the research goals of this pa-
per. The dataset includes only messages that contain
geolocation metadata, which is optionally provided
by smartphone clients. Each message must have a
latitude and longitude within a United States census
block, which enables the demographic analysis in
Section 6. Retweets are excluded (both as identified
in the official Twitter API, as well as messages whose
text includes the token “RT”), as are messages that
contain a URL. Grouping tweets by author, we retain
only authors who have fewer than 1000 “followers”
(people who have chosen to view the author’s mes-
sages in their newsfeed) and who follow fewer than
1000 individuals.

Specific instances of the word pairs are acquired by
using grep to identify messages in which the short-
ened form is followed by another sequence of purely

13



alphabetic characters. Reservoir sampling (Vitter,
1985) was used to obtain a randomized set of at most
10,000 messages for each word. There were only 753
examples of the shortening lef ; for all other words we
obtain the full 10,000 messages. For each shortened
word, an equal number of samples for the standard
form were obtained through the same method: grep
piped through a reservoir sampler. Each instance
of the standard form must also be followed by a
purely alphabetic string. Note that the total number
of instances is slightly higher than the number of
messages, because a word may appear multiple times
within the same message. The counts are shown in
Table 2.

4 Analysis 1: Frequency of vowels after
word shortening

The first experiment tests the hypothesis that con-
sonant clusters are less likely to be reduced when
followed by a word that begins with a vowel letter.
Table 2 presents the counts for each term, along with
the probability that the next segment begins with the
vowel. The probabilities are accompanied by 95%
confidence intervals, which are computed from the
standard deviation of the binomial distribution.All
differences are statistically significant at p < .05.

The simplified form lef is followed by a vowel
only 19% of the time, while the complete form left is
followed by a vowel 35% of the time. The absolute
difference for jus and just is much smaller, but with
such large counts, even this 2% absolute difference
is unlikely to be a chance fluctuation.

The remaining results are more mixed. The short-
ened form wit is significantly more likely to be fol-
lowed by a vowel than its standard form with. The
two “g dropping” examples are inconsistent, and trou-
blingly, there is a significant effect in the control
condition. For these reasons, a more fine-grained
analysis is pursued in the next section.

A potential complication to these results is that
cluster reduction may be especially likely in specific
phrases. For example, most can be reduced to mos,
but in a sample of 1000 instances of this reduction,
72% occurred within a single expression: mos def.
This phrase can be either an expression of certainty
(most definitely), or a reference to the performing
artist of the same name. If mos were observed to

lowing segment begins with a vowel. All differences are

be more likely to be followed by a consonant-initial
word than most, this might be attributable to this one
expression.

An inverse effect could explain the high likelihood
that goin is followed by a vowel. Given that the
author has chosen an informal register, the phrase
goin to is likely to be replaced by gonna. One might
hypothesize the following decision tree:

• If formal register, use going
• If informal register,

– If next word is to, use gonna
– else, use goin

Counts for each possibility are shown in Table 3;
these counts are drawn from a subset of the 100,000
messages and thus cannot be compared directly with
Table 2. Nonetheless, since to is by far the most
frequent successor to going, a great deal of going’s
preference for consonant successors can be explained
by the word to.

5 Analysis 2: Logistic regression to control
for lexical confounds

While it is tempting to simply remove going to and
goin to from the dataset, this would put us on a slip-
pery slope: where do we draw the line between lexi-
cal confounds and phonological effects? Rather than

is far less likely to be followed by to, possibly because of
the frequently-chosen gonna alternative.

tive values indicate that the shortened form is less likely if
followed by a vowel, when controlling for lexical features.

excluding such examples from the dataset, it would
be preferable to apply analytic techniques capable of
sorting out lexical and systematic effects. One such
technique is logistic regression, which forces lexical
and phonological factors to compete for the right to
explain the observed orthographic variations.2

The dependent variable indicates whether the
word-final consonant cluster was reduced. The inde-
pendent variables include a single feature indicating
whether the successor word begins with a vowel, and
additional lexical features for all possible successor
words. If the orthographic variation is best explained
by a small number of successor words, the phono-
logical VOWEL feature will not acquire significant
weight.

of the logistic regression coefficient for the VOWEL
feature, computed over 1000 bootstrapping itera-
tions (Wasserman, 2005).3 The coefficient has the

largest magnitude in cases of consonant cluster re-
duction, and the associated p-values indicate strong
statistical significance. The VOWEL coefficient is
also strongly significant for wit/with. It reaches the
p < .05 threshold for doin/doing, although in this
case, the presence of a vowel indicates a preference
for the shortened form doin — contra the raw fre-
quencies in Table 2. The coefficient for the VOWEL
feature is not significantly different from zero for
goin/going and for the control kno/know. Note that
since we had no prior expectation of the coefficient
sign in these cases, a two-tailed test would be most
appropriate, with critical value α = 0.025 to estab-
lish 95% confidence.

6 Analysis 3: Social variables

The final analysis concerns the relationship between
phonological variation and social variables. In spo-
ken language, the word pairs chosen in this study
have connections with both ethnic and regional di-
alects: consonant cluster reduction is a feature of
African-American English (Green, 2002) and Te-
jano and Chicano English (Bayley, 1994; Santa Ana,
1991); th-stopping (as in wit/with) is a feature of
African-American English (Green, 2002) as well as
several regional dialects (Gordon, 2004; Thomas,
2004); the velar nasal in doin and goin is a property
of informal speech. The control pair kno/know does
not correspond to any sound difference, and thus
there is no prior evidence about its relationship to
social variables.

The dataset includes the average latitude and lon-
gitude for each user account in the corpus. It is possi-
ble to identify the county associated with the latitude
and longitude, and then to obtain county-level de-
mographic statistics from the United States census.
An approximate average demographic profile for
each word in the study can be constructed by ag-
gregating the demographic statistics for the counties
of residence of each author who has used the word.
Twitter users do not comprise an unbiased sample
from each county, so this profile can only describe the
demographic environment of the authors, and not the
demographic properties of the authors themselves.

intervals reflect the Bonferroni correction for mul-
tiple comparison, setting α = 0.05/48. The con-

sonant cluster reduction examples are indeed pre-
ferred by authors from densely-populated (urban)
counties with more African Americans, although
these counties tend to prefer all of the non-standard
variants, including the control pair kno/know. Con-
versely, the non-standard variants have aggregate
demographic profiles that include fewer European
Americans. None of the differences regarding the
percentage of Hispanics/Latinos are statistically sig-
nificant. Overall, these results show an associa-
tion between non-standard orthography and densely-
populated counties with high proportions of African
Americans, but we find no special affinity for conso-
nant cluster reduction.

7 Related work

Previous studies of the impact of dialect on writ-
ing have found relatively little evidence of purely
phonological variation in written language. White-
man (1982) gathered an oral/written dataset of inter-
view transcripts and classroom compositions. In the
written data, there are many examples of final con-
sonant deletion: verbal -s (he go- to the pool), plural
-s (in their hand-), possessive -s (it is Sally- radio),
and past tense -ed. However, each of these deletions
is morphosyntactic rather than purely phonological.
They are seen by Whiteman as an omission of the
inflectional suffix, rather than as a transcription of
phonological variation, which she finds to be very
rare in cases where morphosyntactic factors are not in
play. She writes, “nonstandard phonological features
rarely occur in writing, even when these features are
extremely frequent in the oral dialect of the writer.”

Similar evidence is presented by Thompson et al.
(2004), who compare the spoken and written lan-
guage of 50 third-grade students who were identi-
fied as speakers of African American English (AAE).
While each of these students produced a substantial
amount of AAE in spoken language, they produced
only one third as many AAE features in the written
sample. Thompson et al. find almost no instances
of purely phonological features in writing, including
consonant cluster reduction — except in combina-
tion with morphosyntactic features, such as zero past
tense (e.g. mother kiss(ed) them all goodbye). They
propose the following explanation:

African American students have models
for spoken AAE; however, children do not
have models for written AAE... students
likely have minimal opportunities to ex-
perience AAE in print (emphasis in the
original).

This was written in 2004; in the intervening years,
social media and text messages now provide many
examples of written AAE. Unlike classroom settings,
social media is informal and outside the scope of
school control. Whether the increasing prevalence of
written AAE will ultimately lead to widely-accepted
writing systems for this and other dialects is an in-
triguing open question.

8 Conclusions and future work

The experiments in this paper demonstrate that
phonology impacts social media orthography at the
word level and beyond. I have discussed examples of
three such phenomena: consonant cluster reduction,
th-stopping, and the replacement of the velar nasal
with the coronal (“g-dropping”). Both consonant
cluster reduction and th-stopping are significantly in-
fluenced by the phonological context: their frequency
depends on whether the subsequent segment begins
with a vowel. This indicates that when social media
authors transcribe spoken language variation, they
are not simply replacing standard spellings of indi-
vidual words. The more difficult question — how
phonological context enters into writing — must be
left for future work.

There are several other avenues along which to con-
tinue this research. The sociolinguistic literature de-
scribes a number of other systematic factors that im-
pact consonant cluster reduction (Guy, 1991; Taglia-
monte and Temple, 2005), and a complete model that
included all such factors might shed additional light
on this phenomenon. In such work it is typical to dis-
tinguish between different types of consonants; for
example, Tagliamonte and Temple (2005) distinguish
obstruents, glides, pauses, and the liquids /r/ and /l/.
In addition, while this paper has equated consonant
letters with consonant sounds, a more careful analy-
sis might attempt to induce (or annotate) the pronun-
ciation of the relevant words. The speech synthesis
literature offers numerous such methods (Bisani and
Ney, 2008), though social media text may pose new

17



challenges, particularly for approaches that are based
on generalizing from standard pronunciation dictio-
naries.

One might also ask whether the phonological sys-
tem impacts all authors to the same extent. Labov
(2007) distinguishes two forms of language change:
transmission, where successive generations of chil-
dren advance a sound change, and diffusion, where
language contact leads adults to “borrow” aspects
of other languages or dialects. Labov marshalls ev-
idence from regional sound changes to show that
transmission is generally more structural and reg-
ular, while diffusion is more superficial and irreg-
ular; this may be attributed to the ability of child
language learners to recognize structural linguistic
patterns. Does phonological context impact transcrip-
tion equally among all authors in our data, or can we
identify authors whose use of phonological transcrip-
tion is particularly sensitive to context?
