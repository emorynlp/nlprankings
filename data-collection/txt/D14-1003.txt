Abstract

This work presents two different trans-
lation models using recurrent neural net-
works. The first one is a word-based ap-
proach using word alignments. Second,
we present phrase-based translation mod-
els that are more consistent with phrase-
based decoding. Moreover, we introduce
bidirectional recurrent neural models to
the problem of machine translation, allow-
ing us to use the full source sentence in our
models, which is also of theoretical inter-
est. We demonstrate that our translation
models are capable of improving strong
baselines already including recurrent neu-
ral language models on three tasks:
IWSLT 2013 German→English, BOLT
Arabic→English and Chinese→English.
We obtain gains up to 1.6% BLEU
and 1.7% TER by rescoring 1000-best
lists.

1 Introduction

Neural network models have recently experienced
unprecedented attention in research on statistical
machine translation (SMT). Several groups have
reported strong improvements over state-of-the-art
baselines using feedforward neural network-based
language models (Schwenk et al., 2006; Vaswani
et al., 2013), as well as translation models (Le et
al., 2012; Schwenk, 2012; Devlin et al., 2014).
Different from the feedforward design, recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) have the advantage of be-
ing able to take into account an unbounded his-
tory of previous observations. In theory, this en-
ables them to model long-distance dependencies
of arbitrary length. However, while previous work

on translation modeling with recurrent neural net-
works shows its effectiveness on standard base-
lines, so far no notable gains have been presented
on top of recurrent language models (Auli et al.,
2013; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Hu et al.,
2014).

In this work, we present two novel approaches
to recurrent neural translation modeling: word-
based and phrase-based. The word-based ap-
proach assumes one-to-one aligned source and
target sentences. We evaluate different ways of
resolving alignment ambiguities to obtain such
alignments. The phrase-based RNN approach is
more closely tied to the underlying translation
paradigm. It models actual phrasal translation
probabilities while avoiding sparsity issues by us-
ing single words as input and output units. Fur-
thermore, in addition to the unidirectional formu-
lation, we are the first to propose a bidirectional
architecture which can take the full source sen-
tence into account for all predictions. Our ex-
periments show that these models can improve
state-of-the-art baselines containing a recurrent
language model on three tasks. For our compet-
itive IWSLT 2013 German→English system, we
observe gains of up to 1.6% BLEU and 1.7% TER.
Improvements are also demonstrated on top of our
evaluation systems for BOLT Arabic→English
and Chinese→English, which also include recur-
rent neural language models.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2 we review related work and in Section 3
an overview of long short-term memory (LSTM)
neural networks, a special type of recurrent neural
networks we make use of in this work, is given.
Section 4 describes our novel translation models.
Finally, experiments are presented in Section 5
and we conclude with Section 6.

2 Related Work

In this Section we contrast previous work to ours,
where we design RNNs to model bilingual depen-
dencies, which are applied to rerank n-best lists
after decoding.

To the best of our knowledge, the earliest at-
tempts to apply neural networks in machine trans-
lation (MT) are presented in (Castaño et al.,
1997; Castaño and Casacuberta, 1997; Castaño
and Casacuberta, 1999), where they were used for
example-based MT.

Recently, Le et al. (2012) presented translation
models using an output layer with classes and
a shortlist for rescoring using feedforward net-
works. They compare between word-factored and
tuple-factored n-gram models, obtaining their best
results using the word-factored approach, which is
less amenable to data sparsity issues. Both of our
word-based and phrase-based models eventually
work on the word level. Kalchbrenner and Blun-
som (2013) use recurrent neural networks with
full source sentence representations. The continu-
ous representations are obtained by applying a se-
quence of convolutions, and the result is fed into
the hidden layer of a recurrent language model.
Rescoring results indicate no improvements over
the state of the art. Auli et al. (2013) also in-
clude source sentence representations built either
using Latent Semantic Analysis or by concatenat-
ing word embeddings. This approach produced
no notable gain over systems using a recurrent
language model. On the other hand, our pro-
posed bidirectional models include the full source
sentence relying on recurrency, yielding improve-
ments over competitive baselines already includ-
ing a recurrent language model.

RNNs were also used with minimum translation
units (Hu et al., 2014), which are phrase pairs un-
dergoing certain constraints. At the input layer,
each of the source and target phrases are mod-
eled as a bag of words, while the output phrase
is predicted word-by-word assuming conditional
independence. The approach seeks to alleviate
data sparsity problems that would arise if phrases
were to be uniquely distinguished. Our proposed
phrase-based models maintain word order within
phrases, but the phrases are processed in a word-
pair manner, while the phrase boundaries remain
implicitly encoded in the way the words are pre-
sented to the network. Schwenk (2012) proposed
a feedforward network that predicts phrases of a

fixed maximum length, such that all phrase words
are predicted at once. The prediction is condi-
tioned on the source phrase. Since our phrase-
based model predicts one word at a time, it does
not assume any phrase length. Moreover, our
model’s predictions go beyond phrase boundaries
and cover unbounded history and future contexts.

Using neural networks during decoding re-
quires tackling the costly output normalization
step. Vaswani et al. (2013) avoid this step by
training feedforward neural language models us-
ing noise contrastive estimation, while Devlin et
al. (2014) augment the training objective function
to produce approximately normalized scores di-
rectly. The latter work makes use of translation
and joint models, and pre-computes the first hid-
den layer beforehand, resulting in large speedups.
They report major improvements over strong base-
lines. The speedups achieved by both works al-
lowed to integrate feedforward neural networks
into the decoder.

3 LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks

Our work is based on recurrent neural networks.
In related fields like e. g. language modeling, this
type of neural network has been shown to perform
considerably better than standard feedforward ar-
chitectures (Mikolov et al., 2011; Arisoy et al.,
2012; Sundermeyer et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014).

Most commonly, recurrent neural networks are
trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
where the gradient of the training criterion is com-
puted with the backpropagation through time al-
gorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Werbos, 1990;
Williams and Zipser, 1995). However, the combi-
nation of RNN networks with conventional back-
propagation training leads to conceptual difficul-
ties which are known as the vanishing (or explod-
ing) gradient problem, described e. g. in (Bengio
et al., 1994). To remedy this problem, in (Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber, 1997) it was suggested to
modify the architecture of a standard RNN in such
a way that vanishing and exploding gradients are
avoided during backpropagation. In particular, no
modification of the training algorithm is necessary.
The resulting architecture is referred to as long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.

Bidirectional recurrent neural networks
(BRNNs) were first proposed in (Schuster and
Paliwal, 1997) and applied to speech recognition
tasks. They have been since applied to different

tasks like parsing (Henderson, 2004) and spoken
language understanding (Mesnil et al., 2013).
Bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)
networks are BRNNs using LSTM hidden layers
(Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005). This work
introduces BLSTMs to the problem of machine
translation, allowing powerful models that employ
unlimited history and future information to make
predictions.

While the proposed models do not make any as-
sumptions about the type of RNN used, all of our
experiments make use of recurrent LSTM neural
networks, where we include later LSTM exten-
sions proposed in (Gers et al., 2000; Gers et al.,
2003). The cross-entropy error criterion is used
for training. Further details on LSTM neural net-
works can be found in (Graves and Schmidhuber,
2005; Sundermeyer et al., 2012).

4 Translation Modeling with RNNs

In the following we describe our word- and
phrase-based translation models in detail. We also
show how bidirectional RNNs can enable such
models to include full source information.

4.1 Resolving Alignment Ambiguities
Our word-based recurrent models are only de-
fined for one-to-one-aligned source-target sen-
tence pairs. In this work, we always evaluate the
model in the order of the target sentence. How-
ever, we experiment with several different ways
to resolve ambiguities due to unaligned or mul-
tiply aligned words. To that end, we introduce
two additional tokens, �aligned and �unaligned . Un-

directional RNN translation model.

aligned words are either removed or aligned to an
extra �unaligned token on the opposite side. If an
�unaligned is introduced on the target side, its posi-
tion is determined by the aligned source word that
is closest to the unaligned source word in question,
preferring left to right. To resolve one-to-many
alignments, we use an IBM-1 translation table to
decide for one of the alignment connections to be
kept. The remaining words are also either deleted
or aligned to additionally introduced �aligned to-
kens on the opposite side. Fig. 1 shows an ex-
ample sentence from the IWSLT data, where all �
tokens are introduced.

In a short experiment, we evaluated 5 differ-
ent setups with our unidirectional RNN translation
model (cf. next Section): without any � tokens,
without �unaligned , source identity, target identity
and using all � tokens. Source identity means we

16



introduce no � tokens on source side, but all on
target side. Target identity is defined analogously.
The results can be found in Tab. 1. We use the
setup with all � tokens in all following experi-
ments, which showed the best BLEU performance.

4.2 Word-based RNN Models
Given a pair of source sequence f I1 = f1 . . . fI
and target sequence eI1 = e1 . . . eI , where we as-
sume a direct correspondence between fi and ei,
we define the posterior translation probability by
factorizing on the target words:

p(eI1|f I1 ) =
I∏

i=1

p(ei|ei−11 , f I1 ) (1)

≈
I∏

i=1

p(ei|ei−11 , f i+d1 ) (2)

≈
I∏

i=1

p(ei|f i+d1 ). (3)

We denote the formulation (1) as the bidirectional
joint model (BJM). This model can be simplified
by several independence assumptions. First, we
drop the dependency on the future source infor-
mation, receiving what we denote as the unidirec-
tional joint model (JM) in (2). Here, d ∈ N0 is
a delay parameter, which is set to d = 0 for all
experiments, except for the comparative results re-
ported in Fig. 7. Finally, assuming conditional in-
dependence from the previous target sequence, we
receive the unidirectional translation model (TM)
in (3). Analogously, we can define a bidirectional
translation model (BTM) by keeping the depen-
dency on the full source sentence f I1 , but dropping
the previous target sequence ei−11 :

p(eI1|f I1 ) ≈
I∏

i=1

p(ei|f I1 ). (4)

Fig. 2 shows the dependencies of the word-
based neural translation and joint models. The
alignment points are traversed in target order and
at each time step one target word is predicted.
The pure translation model (TM) takes only source
words as input, while the joint model (JM) takes
the preceding target words as an additional input.
A delay of d > 0 is implemented by shifting the
target sequence by d time steps and filling the first
d target positions and the last d source positions
with a dedicated �padding symbol. The RNN archi-

is illustrated in Fig. 3, which corresponds to the
following set of equations:

p(ei|ei−11 , f i1) = p
(
ei|c(ei), ei−11 , f i1

) ·
p
(
c(ei)|ei−11 , f i1

)
Here, by f̂i and êi−1 we denote the one-hot en-
coded vector representations of the source and
target words fi and ei−1. The outgoing activa-
tion values of the projection layer and the LSTM
layer are yi and zi, respectively. The matrices Aj
contain the weights of the neural network layers.
By ξ(· ;A3, yi−11 ) we denote the LSTM formalism
that we plug in at the third layer. As the LSTM
layer is recurrent, we explicitly include the de-
pendence on the previous layer activations yi−11 .
Finally, ϕ is the widely-used softmax function to
obtain normalized probabilities, and c denotes a
word class mapping from any target word to its
unique word class. For the bidirectional model,
the equations can be defined analogously.

Due to the use of word classes, the output
layer consists of two parts. The class probabil-
ity p

(
c(ei)|ei−11 , f i1

)
is computed first, and then

the word probability p

is ob-

tained given the word class. This trick helps avoid-
ing the otherwise computationally expensive nor-
malization sum, which would be carried out over
all words in the target vocabulary. In a class-
factorized output layer where each word belongs
to a single class, the normalization is carried out
over all classes, whose number is typically much
less than the vocabulary size. The other normal-
ization sum needed to produce the word probabil-
ity is limited to the words belonging to the same
class (Goodman, 2001; Morin and Bengio, 2005).

4.3 Phrase-based RNN Models

One of the conceptual disadvantages of word-
based modeling as introduced in the previous sec-
tion is that there is a mismatch between train-
ing and testing conditions: During neural network
training, the vocabulary has to be extended by ad-
ditional � tokens, and a one-to-one alignment is
used which does not reflect the situation in decod-
ing. In phrase-based machine translation, more
complex alignments in terms of multiple words
on both the source and the target sides are used,
which allow the decoder to make use of richer
short-distance dependencies and are crucial for the
performance of the resulting system.

From this perspective, it seems interesting to
standardize the alignments used in decoding, and
in training the neural network. However, it is dif-
ficult to use the phrases themselves as the vocab-
ulary of the RNN. Usually, the huge number of
potential phrases in comparison to the relatively
small amount of training data makes the learn-
ing of continuous phrase representations difficult

due to data sparsity. This is confirmed by results
presented in (Le et al., 2012), which show that a
word-factored translation model outperforms the
phrase-factored version. Therefore, in this work
we continue relying on source and target word vo-
cabularies for building our phrase representations.
However, we no longer use a direct correspon-
dence between a source and a target word, as en-
forced in our word-based models.

Fig. 4 shows an example phrase alignment,
where a sequence of source words f̃i is directly
mapped to a sequence of target words ẽi for 1 ≤
i ≤ Ĩ . By Ĩ , we denote the number of phrases in
the alignment. We decompose the target sentence
posterior probability in the following way:

p(eI1|fJ1 ) =
Ĩ∏

i=1

p(ẽi|ẽi−11 , f̃ Ĩ1 ) (5)

≈
Ĩ∏

i=1

p(ẽi|ẽi−11 , f̃ i1) (6)

where the joint model in Eq. 5 would correspond
to a bidirectional RNN, and Eq. 6 only requires a
unidirectional RNN. By leaving out the condition-
ing on the target side, we obtain a phrase-based
translation model.

As there is no one-to-one correspondence be-
tween the words within a phrase, the basic idea of
our phrase-based approach is to let the neural net-
work learn the dependencies itself, and present the
full source side of the phrase to the network be-
fore letting it predict target side words. Then the
probability for the target side of a phrase can be
computed, in case of Eq. 6, by:

p(ẽi|ẽi−11 , f̃ Ĩ1 ) =
|ẽi|∏
j=1

p
(
(ẽi)j |(ẽi)j−11 , ẽi−11 , f̃ i1

)
,

and analogously for the case of Eq. 5. Here, (ẽi)j
denotes the j-th word of the i-th aligned target
phrase.

We feed the source side of a phrase into the neu-
ral network one word at a time. Only when the

in normal face, while target words are printed in bold face. Dashed lines indicate phrases from the
example sentence. For brevity, we omit the precise handling of sentence begin and end tokens.

presentation of the source side is finished we start
estimating probabilities for the target side. There-
fore, we do not let the neural network learn a target
distribution until the very last source word is con-
sidered. In this way, we break up the conventional
RNN training scheme where an input sample is di-
rectly followed by its corresponding teacher sig-
nal. Similarly, the presentation of the source side
of the next phrase only starts after the prediction
of the current target side is completed.

To this end, we introduce a no-operation token,
denoted by ε, which is not part of the vocabulary
(which means it cannot be input to or predicted by
the RNN). When the ε token occurs as input, it in-
dicates that no input needs to be processed by the
RNN. When the ε token occurs as a teacher signal
for the RNN, the output layer distribution is ig-
nored, and does not even have to be computed. In
both cases, all the other layers are still processed
during forward and backward passes such that the
RNN state can be advanced even without addi-
tional input or output.

Fig. 5 depicts the evaluation of a phrase-based
joint model for the example alignment from Fig. 4.
For a source phrase f̃i, we include (|ẽi|−1) many ε
symbols at the end of the phrase. Conversely, for
a target phrase ẽi, we include (|f̃i| − 1) many ε
symbols at the beginning of the phrase.

E. g., in the figure, the second dashed rectan-
gle from the left depicts the training of the English
phrase “, for example ,” and its German transla-
tion “zum Beispiel”. At the input layer, we feed in
the source words one at a time, while we present
ε tokens at the target side input layer and the out-
put layer (with the exception of the very first time
step, where we still have the last target word from
the previous phrase as input instead of ε). With

the last word of the source phrase “Beispiel” being
presented to the network, the full source phrase is
stored in the hidden layer, and the neural network
is then trained to predict the target phrase words
at the output layer. Subsequently, the source input
is ε, and the target input is the most recent target
side history word.

To obtain a phrase-aligned training sequence for
the phrase-based RNN models, we force-align the
training data with the application of leave-one-out
as described in (Wuebker et al., 2010).

4.4 Bidirectional RNN Architecture

While the unidirectional RNNs include an un-
bounded sentence history, they are still limited in
the number of future source words they include.
Bidirectional models provide a flexible means to
also include an unbounded future context, which,
unlike the delayed unidirectional models, require
no tuning to determine the amount of delay.

Fig. 6 illustrates the bidirectional model archi-
tecture, which is an extension of the unidirectional
model of Fig. 3. First, an additional recurrent
hidden layer is added in parallel to the existing
one. This layer will be referred to as the back-
ward layer, since it processes information in back-
ward time direction. This hidden layer receives
source word input only, while target words in the
case of a joint model are fed to the forward layer
as in the unidirectional case. Due to the backward
recurrency, the backward layer will make the in-
formation f Ii available when predicting the target
word ei, while the forward layer takes care of the
source history f i1. Jointly, the forward and back-
ward branches include the full source sentence f I1 ,
as indicated in Fig. 2. Fig. 6 shows the “deep”
variant of the bidirectional model, where the for-

source projection matrix is used for the forward
and backward branches.

ward and backward layers converge into a hidden
layer. A shallow variant can be obtained if the
parallel layers converge into the output layer di-
rectly1.

Due to the full dependence on the source se-
quence, evaluating bidirectional networks requires
computing the forward pass of the forward and
backward layers for the full sequence, before be-
ing able to evaluate the next layers. In the back-
ward pass of backpropagation, the forward and
backward recurrent layers are processed in de-
creasing and increasing time order, respectively.

5 Experiments

5.1 Setup

All translation experiments are performed with the
Jane toolkit (Vilar et al., 2010; Wuebker et al.,
2012). The largest part of our experiments is car-
ried out on the IWSLT 2013 German→English
shared translation task.2 The baseline system is
trained on all available bilingual data, 4.3M sen-
tence pairs in total, and uses a 4-gram LM with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney,
1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998), trained with
the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). As additional

converge into an intermediate identity layer, and the aggre-
gate is weighted and fed to the next layer.

data sources for the LM we selected parts of the
Shuffled News and LDC English Gigaword cor-
pora based on cross-entropy difference (Moore
and Lewis, 2010), resulting in a total of 1.7 bil-
lion running words for LM training. The state-of-
the-art baseline is a standard phrase-based SMT
system (Koehn et al., 2003) tuned with MERT
(Och, 2003). It contains a hierarchical reorder-
ing model (Galley and Manning, 2008) and a 7-
gram word cluster language model (Wuebker et
al., 2013). Here, we also compare against a feed-
forward joint model as described by Devlin et al.
(2014), with a source window of 11 words and a
target history of three words, which we denote as
BBN-JM. Instead of POS tags, we predict word
classes trained with mkcls. We use a shortlist
of size 16K and 1000 classes for the remaining
words. All neural networks are trained on the TED
portion of the data (138K segments) and are ap-
plied in a rescoring step on 1000-best lists.

To confirm our results, we run additional
experiments on the Arabic→English and
Chinese→English tasks of the DARPA BOLT
project. In both cases, the neural network models
are added on top of our most competitive eval-
uation system. On Chinese→English, we use a
hierarchical phrase-based system trained on 3.7M
segments with 22 dense features, including an ad-
vanced orientation model (Huck et al., 2013). For
the neural network training, we selected a subset
of 9M running words. The Arabic→English
system is a standard phrase-based decoder trained
on 6.6M segments, using 17 dense features. The
neural network training was performed using a
selection amounting to 15.5M running words.
For both tasks we apply the neural networks by
rescoring 1000-best lists and evaluate results on
two data sets from the ’discussion forum’ domain,
test1 and test2. The sizes of the data sets
for the Arabic→English system are: 1219 (dev),
1510 (test1), and 1137 (test2) segments, and
for the Chinese→English system are: 5074 (dev),
1844 (test1), and 1124 (test2) segments. All
results are measured in case-insensitive BLEU [%]
(Papineni et al., 2002) and TER [%] (Snover et al.,
2006) on a single reference.

guage model yet. Here, the delay parameter d
from Equations 2 and 3 is set to zero. We ob-
serve that for all recurrent translation models, we
achieve substantial improvements over the base-
line on the test data, ranging from 0.9 BLEU
up to 1.6 BLEU. These results are also consistent
with the improvements in terms of TER, where we
achieve reductions by 0.8 TER up to 1.8 TER.

These numbers can be directly compared to the
case of feedforward neural network-based transla-
tion modeling as proposed in (Devlin et al., 2014)
which we include in the very last row of the table.
Nearly all of our recurrent models outperform the
feedforward approach, where the RNN model per-
forming best on the dev data is better on test
by 0.3 BLEU and 1.0 TER.

Interestingly, for the recurrent word-based mod-
els, on the test data it can be seen that TMs per-
form better than JMs, even though TMs do not
take advantage of the target side history words.
However, exploiting this extra information does
not always need to result in a better model, as the
target side words are only derived from the given
source side, which is available to both TMs and
JMs. On the other hand, including future source
words in a bidirectional model clearly improves
the performance further. By adding another LSTM

layer that combines forward and backward time
directions (indicated as ‘deep’ in the table), we ob-
tain our overall best model.

In Fig. 7 we compare the word-based bidirec-
tional TM with a unidirectional TM that uses dif-
ferent time delays d = 0, . . . , 4. For a delay d =
2, the same performance is obtained as with the
bidirectional model, but this comes at the price of
tuning the delay parameter.

In comparison to the unidirectional word-based
models, phrase-based models perform similarly.
In the tables, we include those phrase-based vari-
ants which perform best on the dev data, where
phrase-based JMs always are at least as good or
better than the corresponding TMs in terms of
BLEU. Therefore, we mainly report JM results
for the phrase-based networks. A phrase-based
model can also be trained on multiple variants for
the phrase alignment. For our experiments, we
tested 10-best alignments against the single best
alignment, which resulted in a small improvement
of 0.2 TER on both dev and test. We did not ob-
serve consistent gains by using an additional hid-
den layer or bidirectional models. To some ex-
tent, future information is already considered in
unidirectional phrase-based models by feeding the
complete source side before predicting the target
side.

Tab. 3 shows different model combination re-
sults for the IWSLT task, where a recurrent lan-
guage model is included in the baseline. Adding
a deep bidirectional TM or JM to the recur-
rent language model improves the RNN-LM base-
line by 1.2 BLEU or 1.1 BLEU, respectively. A
phrase-based model substantially improves over

the RNN-LM baseline, but performs not as good
as its word-based counterparts. By adding four
different translation models, including models in
reverse word order and reverse translation direc-
tion, we are able to improve these numbers even
further. However, especially on the test data, the
gains from model combination saturate quickly.

Apart from the IWSLT track, we also ana-
lyze the performance of our translation models on
the BOLT Chinese→English and Arabic→English
translation tasks. Due to the large amount of train-
ing data, we concentrate on models of high perfor-
mance in the IWSLT experiments. The results can
be found in Tab. 4 and 5. In both cases, we see
consistent improvements over the recurrent neural
network language model baseline, improving the
Arabic→English system by 0.6 BLEU and 0.5 TER
on test1. This can be compared to the rescoring
results for the same task reported by (Devlin et al.,
2014), where they achieved 0.3 BLEU, despite the
fact that they used multiple references for scoring,
whereas in our experiments we rely on a single
reference only. The models are also able to im-
prove the Chinese→English system by 0.5 BLEU
and 0.5 TER on test2.

5.3 Analysis

To investigate whether bidirectional models ben-
efit from future source information, we compare
the single-best output of a system reranked with a
unidirectional model to the output reranked with
a bidirectional model. We choose the models
to be translation models in both cases, as they
predict target words independent of previous
predictions, given the source information (cf. Eqs.
(3, 4)). This makes it easier to detect the effect
of including future source information or the lack
thereof. The examples are taken from the IWSLT

Hypothesis 2:

In this example, the German phrase “so wie”
translates to “like” in English. The bidirectional
model prefers hypothesis 2, making use of the
future word “wie” when translating the German
word “so” to �, because it has future insight that
this move will pay off later when translating

not available to the unidirectional model, which
prefers hypothesis 1 instead.

Here, the German phrase “eine Zeit lang” trans-
lates to “for a while” in English. Bidirectional
scoring favors hypothesis 2, while unidirectional
scoring favors hypothesis 1. It seems that the uni-
directional model translates “Zeit” to “time” as the
object of the verb “give” in hypothesis 1, being
blind to the remaining part “lang” of the phrase
which changes the meaning. The bidirectional
model, to its advantage, has the full source infor-
mation, allowing it to make the correct prediction.

6 Conclusion

We developed word- and phrase-based RNN trans-
lation models. The former is simple and performs
well in practice, while the latter is more consistent
with the phrase-based paradigm. The approach in-
herently evades data sparsity problems as it works
on words in its lowest level of processing. Our
experiments show the models are able to achieve
notable improvements over baselines containing a
recurrent LM.

In addition, and for the first time in statistical
machine translation, we proposed a bidirectional
neural architecture that allows modeling past and
future dependencies of any length. Besides its
good performance in practice, the bidirectional ar-
chitecture is of theoretical interest as it allows the
exact modeling of posterior probabilities.
