Abstract 

A web based Manipuri corpus is devel-
oped for identification of reduplicated 
multiword expression (MWE) and mul-
tiword named entity recognition (NER). 
Manipuri is one of the rarely investi-
gated language and its resources for 
natural language processing are not 
available in the required measure. The 
web content of Manipuri is also very 
poor. News corpus from a popular Ma-
nipuri news website is collected. Ap-
proximately four and a half million Ma-
nipuri wordforms have been collected 
from the web. The mode of corpus col-
lection and the identification of redupli-
cated MWEs and multiword NE based 
on support vector machine (SVM) 
learning technique are reported. The 
SVM based reduplicated MWE system 
is evaluated with recall, precision and F-
Score values of 94.62%, 93.53% and 
94.07% respectively outperforming the 
rule based approach. The recall, preci-
sion and F-Score for multiword NE are 
evaluated as 94.82%, 93.12% and 
93.96% respectively. 

1 Introduction  

The NER and MWE identification are important 
tasks for natural language applications that in-
clude machine translation and information re-
trieval. The present work reports the NER and 
reduplicated MWE identification of Manipuri 
on web based news corpus. The use of web as a 
corpus for teaching and research on languages 

has been proposed several times (Rundell, 2000; 
Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher 2004). A 
special issue of the Computational Linguistics 
journal on web as corpus (Kilgarriff and Gre-
fenstette, 2003) was published. Several studies 
have used different methods to mine web data. 
The web walked into the ACL meetings starting 
in 1999. The special interest group of ACL on 
web as corpus is promoting interest in the use of 
the web as a source of linguistic data, and as an 
object of study in its own right. India is a multi-
lingual country with a lot of cultural diversity. 
Bharati et al. (2001) reports an effort to create 
lexical resources such as transfer lexicon and 
grammar from English to several Indian lan-
guages and dependency Treebank of annotated 
corpora for several Indian languages. In Indian 
context, a web based Bengali corpus develop-
ment work from web is reported in Ekbal and 
Bandyopadhyay (2008) and Manipuri-English 
semi automatic parallel corpora extraction by 
Singh et. al., (2010). Newspaper is a huge 
source of readily available documents. In the 
present work, the Manipuri monolingual corpus 
has been developed from web for NLP and re-
lated tasks. 

Manipuri is a scheduled Indian language 
spoken approximately by three million people 
mainly in the state of Manipur in India and in 
the neighboring countries namely Bangladesh 
and Myanmar. It is a Tibeto-Burman language 
and highly agglutinative in nature, influenced 
and enriched by the Indo-Aryan languages of 
Sanskrit origin and English. The affixes play the 
most important role in the structure of the lan-
guage. In Manipuri, words are formed in three 
processes called affixation, derivation and com-
pounding. The majority of the roots found in the 

35



language are bound and the affixes are the de-
termining factor of the class of the words in the 
language. Annotated corpus, bilingual dictiona-
ries, name dictionaries, WordNet, morphologi-
cal analyzers etc. are not yet available in Mani-
puri in the required measure. 

In the present work, the tasks of identifica-
tion of Manipuri multiword named entity (MNE) 
and reduplicated multiword expression (RMWE) 
identification using support vector machine 
(SVM) learning technique on the corpus col-
lected from web is reported. 

Works on multiword expressions (MWEs) 
have started with a momentum in different lan-
guages. In the Indian context, some of the 
works can be seen in (Dandapat et. al., 2006; 
Kunchukuttan and Damani, 2008; Kishorjit et. 
al., 2010). The identification of MWEs in sev-
eral languages concentrate on compound nouns, 
noun-verb combination, some on idioms and 
phrases and so on but not much on RMWEs. 
The reason may be that the reduplicated words 
are either rare or easy to identify for these lan-
guages since only complete duplication and 
some amount of partial reduplication may be 
present in these languages. On the other hand, 
reduplicated MWEs are quite large in number in 
Manipuri and there are wide varieties of redup-
licated MWEs in Manipuri. 

2 Manipuri News Corpus and Statis-
tics 

The content of Manipuri language on the web is 
very poor. One of the sources is the daily news 
publications. Again, there is no repository. Thus, 
the possibility of deploying web crawler and 
mining the web corpus is not possible. The Ma-
nipuri news corpus is collected from 
http://www.thesangaiexpress.com/ covering the 
period from May 2008 to May 2010 on daily 
basis. The Manipuri news is available in PDF 
format. A tool has been developed to convert 
contents from PDF documents to Unicode for-
mat. There are 15-20 articles in each day. Con-
sidering the Manipuri corpus covering the pe-
riod from May 2008 to May 2010, there are 
4649016 wordforms collected

There are no publications on some occasions. 

2.1 Conversion from PDF to UTF-8  

The general Manipuri news collected is in PDF 
format. A tool has been developed to convert 
Manipuri news PDF articles to Bengali Unicode. 
The Bengali Unicode characters are used to 
represent Manipuri as well. The conversion of 
PDF format into Unicode involves the conver-
sion to ASCII and then into Unicode using 
mapping tables between the ASCII characters 
and corresponding Bengali Unicode. The map-
ping tables have been prepared at different le-
vels with separate tables for single characters 
and conjuncts with two or more than two cha-
racters. The single character mapping table con-
tains 72 entries and the conjunct characters 
mapping table consists of 738 entries. There are 
conjuncts of 2, 3 and 4 characters. Sub-tables 
for each of the conjuncts are prepared. English 
words are present on the Manipuri side of the 
news and they are filtered to avoid unknown 
character features. 

2.2 Use of language resources 

The Manipuri web corpus collected from the 
web is cleaned by removing the unknown cha-
racters. After the cleaning process, the running 
texts are picked up followed by spelling correc-
tion. The web based news corpus is POS tagged 
using the 26 tagset

2
 defined for the Indian lan-

guages based on the work of (Singh et. al. , 
2008). The Manipuri news corpus developed in 
this work has been used to identify MNE and 
RMWEs identification. 

3 Support Vector Machine 

The SVM (Vapnik, 1995) is based on discr i-
minative approach and makes use of both pos i-
tive and negative examples to learn the distinc-
tion between the two classes. The SVMs are 
known to robustly handle large feature sets and 
to develop models that maximize their generali-
zability.   Suppose we have a set of training data 

for a two-class problem: 1 1{( , ),.....( , )}N Nx y x y , 
where xi  RD is a feature vector of the i

th
 sam-

ple in the training data and yi  {+1, -1} is the 
class to which xi belongs. The goal is to find a 
decision function that accurately predicts class y

for an input vector x. A non-linear SVM clas-
sifier gives a decision function f (x)= sign (g (x)) 
for an input vector where,

 Here, f(x)=+1 means 

x is a member of a certain class and f(x)=-1 
means x is not a member. The support vector is 
represented by zi and stands for the training ex-
amples; m is the number of support vectors 
Therefore, the computational complexity of g(x) 
is proportional to m. Support vectors and other 
constants are determined by solving a certain 

quadratic programming problem. ( , )iK x z is a 
kernel that implicitly maps vectors into a higher 
dimensional space. Typical kernels use dot 

products: ( , ) ( . )iK x z k x z .A polynomial ker-

nel of degree d is given by ( , )iK x z = (1+x)d. 
We can use various kernels, and the design of 
an appropriate kernel for a particular application 
is an important research issue. 

The MNE/RMWE tagging system includes 
two main phases: training and classification. 
The training process has been carried out by 
YamCha

3
 toolkit, an SVM based tool for detect-

ing classes in documents and formulating the 
MNE/RMWE tagging task as a sequence labe-
ling problem. Here, both one vs rest and pair-
wise multi-class decision methods have been 
used. Different experiments with the various 
degrees of the polynomial kernel function have 
been carried out. In one vs rest strategy, K bi-
nary SVM classifiers may be created where 
each classifier is trained to distinguish one class 
from the remaining K-1 classes. In pairwise 
classification, we constructed K (K-1)/2 clas-
sifiers considering all pairs of classes, and the 
final decision is given by their weighted voting. 
For classification, the TinySVM-0.07

4
 classifier 

has been used that seems to be the best opti-
mized among publicly available SVM toolkits.  

4 Multiword Named Entity Recogni-

tion  

Named Entity Recognition for Manipuri is re-
ported in (Singh et. al., 2009). The present work 
focuses and reports on the recognition of mul-
tiword NEs. In order to identify the MNEs,  

                                                 
3http://chasen-org/~taku/software/yamcha/  
4http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/~taku-ku/software/TinySVM  

28,629 wordforms from Manipuri news corpus 
has been manually annotated and used as train-
ing data with the major named entity (NE) tags, 
namely person name, location name, organiza-
tion name and miscellaneous name to apply 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) based machine 
learning technique. Miscellaneous name in-
cludes the festival name, name of objects, name 
of building, date, time, measurement expression 
and percentage expression etc. The SVM based 
system makes use of the different contextual 
information of the words along with the variety 
of word-level orthographic features that are 
helpful in predicting the MNE classes. 

MNE identification in Indian languages as 
well as in Manipuri is difficult and challenging 
as: 
 Unlike English and most of the European lan-

guages, Manipuri lacks capitalization infor-
mation, which plays a very important role in 
identifying MNEs. 
 A lot of MNEs in Manipuri can appear in the 

dictionary with some other specific meanings. 
 Manipuri is a highly inflectional language 

providing one of the richest and most chal-
lenging sets of linguistic and statistical fea-
tures resulting in long and complex word-
forms. 
 Manipuri is a relatively free word order lan-

guage. Thus MNEs can appear in subject and 
object positions making the NER task more 
difficult compared to others. 
 Manipuri is a resource-constrained language. 

Annotated corpus, name dictionaries, sophis-
ticated morphological analyzers, POS taggers 
etc. are not yet available.

MNEs properly.  Table 1 shows examples. 

5 Reduplicated MWEs Identification 

Manipuri is very rich in RMWEs like other Ti-
beto-Burman languages. The work of (Singh, 
2000) describes the linguistic rules for identify-
ing reduplicated words. A rule based Manipuri 
RMWE identification is reported in (Kishorjit 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2010). The process of re-
duplication (Singh, 2000) is defined as: ‘redup-
lication is that repetition, the result of which 
constitutes a unit word’.  These single unit 
words are the MWEs. The RMWEs in Manipuri 
are classified as: 1) Complete RMWEs, 2) Par-
tial RMWEs, 3) Echo RMWEs and 4) Mimic 
RMWEs. Apart from these four types of 
RMWEs, there are also cases of a) Double 
RMWEs and b) Semantic RMWEs. 

Complete RMWEs: In the complete 
RMWEs the single word or clause is repeated 
once forming a single unit regardless of phono-
logical or morphological variations. 

মরিক মরিক (‘marik marik’) which means 

‘drop by drop’. 
 অটেক অটেকপা (‘atek atek-pa’ ) which 

means ‘fresh’ 
করি করি (‘kari kari’) means ‘what/which’.  
Partial RMWEs: In case of partial 

reduplication the second word carries some part 
of the first word as an affix to the second word, 
either as a suffix or a prefix. 

For example, চটথাক চরসিন (‘chat-thok chat-
sin’) means ‘to go to and fro’; শামী লানমী (‘saa-mi 
laan-mi’) means ‘army’. 

Mimic RMWEs: In the mimic  
reduplication the words are complete 
reduplication but the morphemes are 
onomatopoetic, usually emotional or natural 
sounds. For example, কিক কিক  (‘krak krak’ ) 
means ‘cracking sound of earth in drought’. 

Echo RMWEs: The second word does not 
have a dictionary meaning and is basically an 
echo word of the first word. For example, থকরি 
খারি (‘thak-si kha-si‘) means ‘good manner’. 

Double RMWEs: Such type of reduplica-
tion generally consists of three words where the 
prefix or suffix of the first two words is redupli-

cated but in the third word the prefix or suffix is 
absent. An example of double prefix reduplica-
tion is ইমনু ইমনু মনুবা (‘i-mun i-mun mun-ba’) 
which means, ‘completely ripe’. 

Semantic RMWEs: Both the reduplication 
words have the same meaning and so also is the 
MWE. Such types of MWEs are very special to 
the Manipuri language. For example,  পামবা কক 
(‘paamba kei’) means ‘tiger’ and each of the 
component words means ‘tiger’. 

5.1 Role of suffix and prefix 

Apart from the above cases meaningful prefixes 
or suffixes are used with RMWEs otherwise 
they are ungrammatical.

tagging 
 

Prefix: With such prefixes the semantic 
shapes are different and sometimes even the 
same prefix carries a different meaning. By 
these prefixation, the root is reduplicated as 
given below: 

 
{[ই(i)-/পঙ(pang)-/খঙ(khang)-/ৈ(ta)-/পুম(pum)-/ 
শকু(suk)] + Root }  

  
{[ই(i)-/পঙ(pang)-/খঙ(khang)-/ৈ(ta)-/পুম(pum)-/ 
শকু(suk)] + Root  + Root} 

 
মহাক্না   ইৱাঙ  ৱাঙই 

 mahaak-na       i-waang    waang-ngi 
 he/she-nom    –tall          tall-asp 
 He/She is the tallest 

 

Suffix: There are some suffixes that carry 
certain meaning when used with RMWEs. 
Commonly used suffixes are, রিক (-trik) / রিক (-
drik), থ্রাক (-throk), থ্িাং (-drong), শকু (-suk), শঙ (-
sang), রিং (-dring), রশত্ (-sit), রশন (-sin), থ্িং (-

38



dreng), থ্রাক (-sroke) etc. Generally these suffix-
es indicate a superlative degree or emphatic 
meaning. 

Some examples are as follows, 
মনুরিক       মনুবা 

mun-trik   mun-ba 
ripe         ripe 

‘very ripe’ 
 

Role of affix in Partial Reduplication: 
Character-wise comparisons are done with not 
less than two characters either from front or rear 
for both the words since the second word is not 
a complete repetition.  

Also the last few characters of the first 
word and the same number of first characters of 
the second word are compared to check the par-
tial reduplication. The prefixes or suffixes are 
verified with a list of accepted suffixes and pre-
fixes (see table 2) to validated the reduplication.  

Role of affix in Echo Reduplication: 
Identification of echo reduplication is done by 
comparing the equality of suffixes of   consecu-
tive two words w1 and w2. 

6 Best Feature Selection for SVM 

The use of prefix/suffix information works well 

for the highly inflected languages like the In-

dian languages. Different combinations from 

the following set for identifying  the best feature 

set for MNE/RMWE are experimented: 

F={ , .., 1, , 1, ....,i m i i i i nw w w w w    , |prefix|<=n, 
|suffix|<=n, MNE/RMWE tag(s) of previous 

word(s), POS tag(s) of the current and/or the 

surrounding word(s), First word, Length of the 

word, Digit information, Infrequent word}, 

where iw  is the current word; i mw   is the 
previous m

th
 word and i nw   is the next nth 

word. Following are the details of the features: 

1 Context word feature: Preceding and fol-

lowing words of a particular word since 

the surrounding words carry effective in-

formation for the identification of 

MNE/RMWEs. 

2 Word suffix: Word suffix information is 

helpful to identify MNE/RMWEs. This is 

based on the observation that the 

MNE/RMWEs share some common suf-

fixes. The fixed length (say, n) word suf-

fix of the current and/or the surrounding 

word(s) can be treated as the feature. If 

the length of the corresponding word is 

less than or equal to n − 1 then the feature 

values are not defined and are denoted by 

‘ND’. The feature value is also not de-

fined (ND) if the token itself is a punctua-

tion symbol or contains any special sym-

bol or digit. Word suffixes are the effec-

tive features and work well for the highly 

inflective Indian languages like Manipuri.  

3 Word prefix: Word prefixes are also help-

ful to identify MNE/RMWEs. It is based 

on the observation that MNE/RMWEs 

share some common prefix strings. This 

feature has been defined in a similar way 

as that of the fixed length suffixes.  

4 MNE and RMWE Information: The 

MNE/RMWE tag(s) of the previous 

word(s) have been used as the only dy-

namic feature in the experiment. The out-

put tag of the previous word is very in-

formative in deciding the MNE/RMWE 

tag of the current word. 

5 Digit features: Several binary valued digit 

features have been defined depending 

upon the  

(i). Presence and/or the exact number 

of digits in a token. 

(a). CntDgtCma: Token consists of 

digits and comma 

 (b). CntDgtPrd: Token consists of 

digits and periods 

(ii). Combination of digits and sym-

bols. For example, 

(a). CntDgtSlsh: Token consists of 

digit and slash 

(b). CntDgtHph: Token consists of 

digits and hyphen 

(c). CntDgtPrctg: Token consists of 

digits and percentages 

(iii). Combination of digit and special 

symbols. For example, 

(a). CntDgtSpl: Token consists of 

digit and special symbol such as $, 

# etc. 

39



These binary valued digit features are 
helpful in recognizing miscellaneous 

NEs such as measurement expression 

and percentage expression. 
6 Infrequent word: The frequencies of the 

words in the training corpus have been 

calculated. A cut off frequency has been 

chosen in order to consider the words that 

occur with less than the cut off frequency 

in the training corpus. A binary valued 

feature ‘Infrequent’ is defined to check 

whether the current word appears in this 

infrequent word list or not. This is based 

on the observation that the infrequent 

words are most probably MNE/RMWEs. 

7 Length of a word: This binary valued fea-

ture is used to check whether the length 

of the current word is less than three or 

not. We have observed that very short 

words are most probably not the 

MNE/RMWEs. 

8 Part of Speech (POS) information: 
We have used an SVM-based POS 

tagger (Singh et. al., 2008) that was 

originally developed with 26 POS 
tags, defined for the Indian languages. 

The POS information of the current 

and/or the surrounding words can be 
effective for MNE/RMWE identifica-

tion. 

 
The Table 3 gives the statistics of training, 

development and test sets. The various nota-
tions used in the experiments are presented in 
Table 4. The Table 5 shows the recall (R), pre-
cision (P) and F-Score (FS) in percentage in the

7 Results on the Test Set 

The best feature set (F) of Manipuri MNER and 
RMWE is identified as F=[prefixes and suffixes 
of length upto three characters of the current 
word, dynamic NE tags of the previous two 
words, POS tags of the previous two and next 
two words, digit information, length of the 
word]. After the selection of the best feature set, 
the SVM based system for MNE and RMWEs 
is tested on the test set of 4,763 wordforms.

In this work, SVM that parses from left to 
right is considered. The break-up of the 
RMWEs and the scores are given in Table 6. 
The handling of semantic RMWEs requires fur-
ther investigation to improve the performance. 
The rule based RMWE identification (Kishorjit 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2010) shows a recall, pre-
cision and F-Score of 94.24%, 82.27% and 
87.68% respectively.

8 Conclusion 

In this paper, the development of RMWEs iden-
tification and recognition of MNE for a re-
source-constrained language using web based 
corpus of Manipuri is reported. This training 
data of 28,629 is then manually annotated with 
a coarse-grained tagset of four NE tags and six 
RMWEs in order to apply SVM and tested with 
4,763 wordforms. The SVM classifier makes 
use of the different contextual information of 
the words along with the various orthographic 
word-level features. A number of experiments 
have been carried out to find out the best set of 
features for MWE in Manipuri. The SVM based 
RMWE system outperforms the rule based ap-
proach. The SVM based RMWE shows recall, 
precision and F-Score of 94.62%, 93.53% and 
94.07% respectively. The rule based RMWE 

41



identification shows a recall, precision and F-
Score of 94.24%, 82.27% and 87.68% respec-
tively. The overall performance of the system 
shows reasonable output for both MNE and 
RMWE.
