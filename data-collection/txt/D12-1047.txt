Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel translation
model (TM) based cross-lingual data selec-
tion model for language model (LM) adapta-
tion in statistical machine translation (SMT),
from word models to phrase models. Given
a source sentence in the translation task, this
model directly estimates the probability that
a sentence in the target LM training corpus
is similar. Compared with the traditional ap-
proaches which utilize the first pass translation
hypotheses, cross-lingual data selection mod-
el avoids the problem of noisy proliferation.
Furthermore, phrase TM based cross-lingual
data selection model is more effective than
the traditional approaches based on bag-of-
words models and word-based TM, because
it captures contextual information in model-
ing the selection of phrase as a whole. Ex-
periments conducted on large-scale data set-
s demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on
both LM perplexity and SMT performance.

1 Introduction

Language model (LM) plays a critical role in sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT). It seems to be
a universal truth that LM performance can always
be improved by using more training data (Brants et
al., 2007), but only if the training data is reason-
ably well-matched with the desired output (Moore
and Lewis, 2010). It is also obvious that among the
large training data the topics or domains of discus-
sion will change (Eck et al., 2004), which causes the
mismatch problems with the translation task. For

this reason, most researchers preferred to select sim-
ilar training data from the large training corpus in the
past few years (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004;
Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010; Axelrod et
al., 2011). This would empirically provide more ac-
curate lexical probabilities, and thus better match the
translation task at hand (Axelrod et al., 2011).

Many previous data selection approaches for LM
adaptation in SMT depend on the first pass transla-
tion hypotheses (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004;
Kim, 2005; Masskey and Sethy, 2010), they selec-
t the sentences which are similar to the translation
hypotheses. These schemes are overall limited by
the quality of the translation hypotheses (Tam et al.,
2007 and 2008), and better initial translation hy-
potheses lead to better selected sentences (Zhao et
al., 2004). However, while SMT has achieved a
great deal of development in recent years, the trans-
lation hypotheses are still far from perfect (Wei and
Pal, 2010), which have many noisy data. The noisy
translation hypotheses mislead data selection pro-
cess (Xu et al., 2001; Tam et al., 2006 and 2007;
Wei and Pal, 2010), and thus take noisy data into the
selected training data, which causes noisy prolifera-
tion and degrades the performance of adapted LM.

Furthermore, traditional approaches for LM adap-
tation are based on bag-of-words models and con-
sidered to be context independent, despite of their
state-of-the-art performance, such as TF-IDF (Eck et
al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005;
Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007), centroid simi-
larity (Masskey and Sethy, 2010), and cross-lingual
similarity (CLS) (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011a).
They all perform at the word level, exact only ter-

512



m matching schemes, and do not take into account
any contextual information when modeling the se-
lection by single words in isolation, which degrade
the quality of selected sentences.

In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to mod-
el the data selection based on the source transla-
tion task directly and capture the contextual infor-
mation for LM adaptation. To this end, we propose
a more principled translation model (TM) based
cross-lingual data selection model for LM adapta-
tion, from word models to phrase models. We as-
sume that the data selection should be performed
by the cross-lingual model and at the phrase lev-
el. Given a source sentence in the translation task,
this model directly estimates the probability before
translation that a sentence in the target LM train-
ing corpus is similar. Therefore, it does not require
the translation task to be pre-translation as in mono-
lingual adaptation, and can address the problem of
noisy proliferation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
extensive and empirical study of using phrase T-
M based cross-lingual data selection for LM adap-
tation. This model learns the transform probabili-
ty of a multi-term phrase in a source sentence giv-
en a phrase in the target sentence of LM training
corpus. Compared with bag-of-words models and
word-based TM that account for selecting single
words in isolation, this model performs at the phrase
level and captures some contextual information in
modeling the selection of phrase as a whole, thus it
is potentially more effective. More precise data se-
lection can be determined for phrases than for word-
s. In this model, we propose a linear ranking model
framework to further improve the performance, re-
ferred to the linear discriminant function (Duda et
al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Gao et al., 2005) in pattern
classification and information retrieval (IR), where
different models are incorporated as features, as we
will show in our experiments.

Unlike the general TM in SMT, we explore the
use of TextRank algorithm (Mihalcea et al., 2004)
to identify and eliminate unimportant words (e.g.,
non-topical words, common words) for corpus pre-
processing, and construct TM by important words.
This reduces the average number of words in cross-
lingual data selection model, thus improving the ef-
ficiency. Moreover, TextRank utilizes the contex-

t information of words to assign term weights (Lee
et al., 2008), which makes phrase TM based cross-
lingual data selection model play its advantage of
capturing the contextual information, thus further
improving the performance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces the related work of
LM adaptation. Section 3 presents the framework
of cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation.
Section 4 describes our proposed TM based cross-
lingual data selection model: from word models to
phrase models. In section 5 we present large-scale
experiments and analyses, and followed by conclu-
sions and future work in section 6.

2 Related Work

TF-IDF and cosine similarity have been widely used
for LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Zhao et al.,
2004; Hildebrand et al., 2005; Kim, 2005; Foster
and Kuhn, 2007). Masskey and Sethy (2010) se-
lected the auxiliary data by computing centroid sim-
ilarity score to the centroid of the in-domain data.
The main idea of these methods is to select the sen-
tences which are similar to the first pass translation
hypotheses or in-domain corpus from the large LM
training corpus, and estimate the bias LM for SMT
system to improve the translation quality.

Tam et al. (2007 and 2008) proposed a bilingual-
LSA model for LM adaptation. They integrated
the LSA marginal into the target generic LM using
marginal adaptation which minimizes the Kullback-
Leibler divergence between the adapted LM and the
generic LM. Ananthakrishnan et al. (2011a) pro-
posed CLS to bias the count and probability of cor-
responding n-gram through weighting the LM train-
ing corpus. However, these two cross-lingual ap-
proaches focus on modify LM itself, which are d-
ifferent from data selection method for LM adap-
tation. In our comparable experiments, we apply
CLS for the first time to the task of cross-lingual
data selection for LM adaptation. Due to lack of
smoothing measure for sparse vector representation
in CLS, the similarity computation is not accurate
which degrades the performance of adapted LM. To
avoid this, we add smoothing measure like TF-IDF,
called CLSs, as we will discuss in the experiments.

Snover et al. (2008) used a word TM based CLIR

513



system (Xu et al., 2001) to select a subset of tar-
get documents comparable to the source document
for adapting LM. Because of the data sparseness in
the document state and it operated at the document
level, this model selected large quantities of irrele-
vant text, which may degrade the adapted LM (Eck
et al., 2004; Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011b). In our
word TM based cross-lingual data selection model,
we operate at the sentence level and add the smooth-
ing mechanism by integrating with the background
word frequency model, and these can significantly
improve the performance. Axelrod et al. (2011)
proposed a bilingual cross-entropy difference to se-
lect data from parallel corpus for domain adaptation
which captures the contextual information slightly,
and outperformed monolingual cross-entropy differ-
ence (Moore and Lewis, 2010), which first shows the
advantage of bilingual data selection. However, its
performance depends on the parallel in-domain cor-
pus which is usually hard to find, and its application
is assumed to be limited.

3 Cross-Lingual Data Selection for
Language Model Adaptation

Our LM adaptation is an unsupervised similar train-
ing data selection guided by TM based cross-lingual
data selection model. For the source sentences in
the translation task, we estimate a new LM, the bias
LM, from the corresponding target LM training sen-
tences which are selected as the similar sentences.
Since the size of the selected sentences is small, the
corresponding bias LM is specific and more effec-
tive, giving high probabilities to those phrases that
occur in the desired output translations.

Following the work of (Zhao et al., 2004; Snover
et al., 2008), the generic LM Pg(wi|h) and the bias
LM Pb(wi|h) are combined using linear interpola-
tion as the adapted LM Pa(wi|h), which is shown to
improve the performance over individual model,

Pa(wi|h) = µPg(wi|h) + (1− µ)Pb(wi|h) (1)

where the interpolation factor µ can be simply esti-
mated using the Powell Search algorithm (Press et
al., 1992) via cross-validation.

Our work focuses on TM based cross-lingual data
selection model, from word model to phrase models,
and the quality of this model is crucial to the perfor-
mance of adapted LM.

4 Translation Model for Cross-Lingual
Data Selection (CLTM)

Let Q = q1, . . . ,qj be a source sentence in the
translation task and S = w1, . . . ,wi be a sentence
in the general target LM training corpus, thus cross-
lingual data selection model can be framed proba-
bilistically as maximizing the P (S|Q) . By Bayes’
rule,

P (S|Q) = P (S)P (Q|S)
P (Q)

(2)

where the prior probability P (S) can be viewed as
uniform, and the P (Q) is constant across all sen-
tences. Therefore, selecting a sentence to maximize
P (S|Q) is equivalent to selecting a sentence that
maximizes P (Q|S).

4.1 Word-Based Translation Model for
Cross-Lingual Data Selection (CLWTM)

4.1.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection Model
Following the work of (Xu et al., 2001; Snover et al.,
2008), CLWTM can be described as

P (Q|S) =
∏
q∈Q

P (q|S) (3)

P (q|S) = αP (q|Cq)+ (1−α)
∑
w∈S

P (q|w)P (w|S)

(4)
where α is the interpolation weight empirically set
as a constant1, P (q|w) is the word-based TM which
is estimated by IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993)
from the parallel corpus, P (q|Cq) and P (w|S) are
the un-smoothed background and sentence model,
respectively, estimated using maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) as

P (q|Cq) =
freq(q, Cq)

|Cq|
(5)

P (w|S) = freq(w, S)
|S|

(6)

where Cq refers to the translation task, freq(q, Cq)
refers to the number of times q occurs in Cq,
freq(w, S) refers to the number of times w occurs
in S, and |Cq| and |S| are the sizes of the translation
task and the current target sentence, respectively.

1As in Xu et al. (2001), a value of 0.3 was used for α.

4.1.2 Ranking Candidate Sentences
Because of the data sparseness in the sentence state
which degrades the model, Equation (6) does not
perform well in our data selection experiments. In-
spired by the work of (Berger et al., 1999) in IR, we
make the following smoothing mechanism:

P (q|S) = αP (q|Cq)+(1−α)
∑
w∈S

P (q|w)Ps(w|S)

(7)
Ps(w|S) = βP (w|Cs) + (1− β)P (w|S) (8)

P (w|Cs) =
freq(w,Cs)

|Cs|
(9)

where P (w|Cs) is the un-smoothed background
model, estimated using MLE as Equation (5), Cs
refers to the LM training corpus and |Cs| refers to
its size. Here, β is interpolation weight; notice that
letting β = 0 in Equation (8) reduces the model to
the un-smoothed model in Equation (4).

4.2 Phrase-Based Translation Model for
Cross-Lingual Data Selection (CLPTM)

4.2.1 Cross-Lingual Sentence Selection Model
The phrase-based TM (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and
Ney, 2004) has shown superior performance com-
pared to the word-based TM. In this paper, the
goal of phrase-based TM is to transfer S into Q.
Rather than transferring single words in isolation,
the phrase model transfers one sequence of word-
s into another sequence of words, thus incorporat-
ing contextual information. Inspired by the work
of web search (Gao et al., 2010) and question re-
trieval in community question answer (Q&A) (Zhou
et al., 2011), we assume the following generative
process: first the sentence S is broken into K non-
empty word sequences w1, . . . ,wk, then each is
transferred into a new non-empty word sequences
q1, . . . ,qk, and finally these phrases are permutat-
ed and concatenated to form the sentence Q, where
q and w denote the phrases or consecutive sequence
of words.

To formulate this generative process, let U denote
the segmentation of S into K phrases w1, . . . ,wk,
and let V denote the K phrases q1, . . . ,qk, we refer
to these (wi,qi) pairs as bi-phrases. Finally, let M
denote a permutation ofK elements representing the
final ranking step.

Next we place a probability distribution over
rewrite pairs. Let B(S,Q) denote the set of U ,
V , M triples that transfer S into Q. Here we as-
sume a uniform probability over segmentations, so
the phrase-based selection probability can be formu-
lated as

P (Q|S) ∝
∑

(U,V,M)∈
B(S,Q)

P (V |S,U) · P (M |S,U, V )

(10)
Then, we use the maximum approximation to the

sum:

P (Q|S) ≈ max
(U,V,M)∈
B(S,Q)

P (V |S,U) · P (M |S,U, V )

(11)
Although we have defined a generative model for

transferring S into Q, our goal is to calculate the
ranking score function over existing Q and S. How-
ever, this model can not be used directly for sen-
tence ranking becauseQ and S are often of different
lengths, the length of S is almost 1.5 times to that of
Q in our corpus, leaving many words in S unaligned
to any word in Q. This is another key difference be-
tween our task and SMT. As pointed out by the pre-
vious work (Berger and Lafferty, 1999; Gao et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2011), sentence-query selection
requires a distillation of the sentence, while selec-
tion of natural language tolerates little being thrown
away. Thus we restrict our attention to those key sen-
tence words that form the distillation of S, do not
consider the unaligned words in S, and assume that
Q is transfered only from the key sentence words.

In this paper, the key sentence words are identi-
fied via word alignment. Let A = a1 . . . aJ be the
”hidden” word alignment, which describes a map-
ping from a term position j in Q to a word position
aj in S. We assume that the positions of the key
sentence words are determined by the Viterbi align-
ment Â, which can be obtained using IBM Model 1
(Brown et al., 1993) as follows:

Â = arg max
A

P (Q,A|S)

= arg max
A

{
P (J |I)

J∏
j=1

P (qj |waj )
}

=
[
arg max

aj
P (qj |waj )

]J
j=1

(12)

515



Given Â, when scoring a given Q/S pair, we re-
strict our attention to those U , V , M triples that are
consistent with Â, which we denote as B(S,Q, Â).
Here, consistency requires that if two words are
aligned in Â, then they must appear in the same bi-
phrase (wi,qi). Once the word alignment is fixed,
the final permutation is uniquely determined, so we
can safely discard that factor. Then Equation (11)
can be written as

P (Q|S) ≈ max
(U,V,M)∈
B(S,Q,Â)

P (V |S,U) (13)

For the sole remaining factor P (V |S,U), we
assume that a segmented queried question V =
q1, . . . ,qk is generated from left to right by transfer-
ring each phrase w1, . . . ,wk independently, as fol-
lows:

P (V |S,U) =
K∏

k=1

P (qk|wk) (14)

where P (qk|wk) is a phrase translation probability
computed from the parallel corpus, which can be es-
timated in two ways (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and
Ney, 2004): relative frequency and lexical weight-
ing, and has two format: phrase translation proba-
bility and lexical weight probability.

In order to find the maximum probability assign-
ment P (Q|S) efficiently, we use a dynamic pro-
gramming approach, somewhat similar to the mono-
tone decoding algorithm described in the work (Och,
2002). We consider quantity aj as the maximal
probability of the most likely sequence of phrases
in S covering the first j words in Q, therefore the
probability can be calculated using the following re-
cursion:

step (1). Initialization:

α0 = 1 (15)

step (2). Induction:

αj =
∑

j′<j,q=qj′+1...qj

{
αj′P (q|wq)

}
(16)

step (3). Total:

P (Q|S) = αJ (17)

4.2.2 Ranking Candidate Sentences
However, directly using the phrase-based TM, com-
puted in Equations (15) to (17), to rank the candi-
date sentences does not perform well. Inspired by
the linear discriminant function (Duda et al., 2001;
Collins, 2002; Gao et al., 2005) in pattern classifi-
cation and IR, we therefore propose a linear rank-
ing model framework for cross-lingual data selec-
tion model in which different models are incorporat-
ed as features.

We consider the linear ranking model as follows:

Score(Q,S) = λT ·H(Q,S)

=
N∑

n=1

λnhn(Q,S) (18)

where the model has a set of N features, and each
feature is an arbitrary function that maps (Q|S) to a
real value, i.e., H(Q,S) ∈ R. λn for n = 1 . . . N
is the corresponding parameters of each feature,
and we optimize these parameters using the Pow-
ell Search algorithm (Press et al., 1992) via cross-
validation.

The used features in the linear ranking model are
as follows:
• Phrase translation feature (PT):
hPT (Q,S,A) = logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S)
is computed using Equations (15) to (17), and
P (qk|wk) is phrase translation probability.
• Inverted phrase translation feature (IPT):
hIPT (S,Q,A) = logP (S|Q), where P (S|Q)
is computed using Equations (15) to (17), and
P (wk|qk) is inverted phrase translation proba-
bility.
• Lexical weight feature (LW): hLW (Q,S,A) =

logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S) is computed using
Equations (15) to (17), and P (qk|wk) is lexical
weight probability.
• Inverted lexical weight feature (ILW):
hILW (S,Q,A) = logP (S|Q), where
P (S|Q) is computed using Equations (15) to
(17), and P (wk|qk) is inverted lexical weight
probability.
• Unaligned word penalty feature (UWP):
hUWP (Q,S,A), which is defined as the ratio
between the number of unaligned terms and
the total number of terms in Q.

516



• Word-based translation feature (WT):
hWT (Q,S,A) = logP (Q|S), where P (Q|S)
is the word-based TM defined by Equations (3)
and (7).

4.3 Eliminating Unimportant Words (EUW)

To improve the efficiency of cross-lingual data se-
lection process, we consider the translation task, the
LM training corpus and the parallel corpus in our
task are constructed by the key words or importan-
t words, and thus construct TM by the key words
or important words, which is another key difference
between our task and SMT. We identify and elimi-
nate unimportant words, somewhat similar to Q&A
retrieval (Lee et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2011). Thus,
the average number of words (the total word number
inQ and S) in cross-lingual sentence selection mod-
el would be minimized naturally, and the efficiency
of cross-lingual data selection would be improved.

In this paper, we adopt a variant of TextRank
algorithm (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a graph-
based ranking model for key word extraction which
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. It identifies and
eliminates unimportant words from the corpus, and
assumes that a word is unimportant if it holds a rela-
tively low significance in the corpus. Compared with
the traditional approaches, such as TF-IDF, Tex-
tRank utilizes the context information of words to
assign term weights (Lee et al., 2008), so it further
improves the performance of CLPTM, as we will
show in the experiments.

Following the work of (Lee et al., 2008), the rank-
ing algorithm proceeds as follows. First, all the
words in a given document are added as vertices in
a graph. Then edges are added between words (ver-
tices) if the words co-occur in a fixed-sized window.
The number of co-occurrences becomes the weight
of an edge. When the graph is constructed, the score
of each vertex is initialized as 1, and the PageRank
based ranking algorithm is run on the graph itera-
tively until convergence. The TextRank score Rkwi,D
of a word wi in document D at kth iteration is de-
fined as follows:

Rkwi,D = (1−d)+d·
∑

∀j:(i,j)∈G

ei,j∑
∀l:(j,l)∈G ej,l

Rk−1wj ,D

(19)
where d is a damping factor usually set as a constan-

t2, and ei,j is an edge weight between wi and wj .
In our experiments, we manually set the propor-

tion to be removed as 25%, that is to say, 75% of
total words in the documents would be remained as
the important words.

5 Experiments

We measure the utility of our proposed LM adap-
tation approach in two ways: (a) comparing refer-
ence translations based perplexity of adapted LMs
with the generic LM, and (b) comparing SMT per-
formance of adapted LMs with the generic LM.

5.1 Corpus and Tasks

We conduct experiments on two Chinese-to-English
translation tasks: IWSLT-07 (dialogue domain) and
NIST-06 (news domain).

IWSLT-07. The bilingual training corpus comes
from BTEC3 and CJK4 corpus, which contain-
s 3.82K sentence pairs with 3.0M/3.1M Chi-
nese/English words. The LM training corpus is from
the English side of the parallel data (BTEC, CJK,
and CWMT20085), which consists of 1.34M sen-
tences and 15.2M English words. The test set is
IWSLT-07 test set which consists of 489 sentences,
and the development set is IWSLT-05 test set which
consists of 506 sentences.

NIST-06. The bilingual training corpus comes
from Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)6, which
consists of 3.4M sentence pairs with 64M/70M Chi-
nese/English words. The LM training corpus is from
the English side of the parallel data as well as the
English Gigaword corpus7, which consists of 11.3M
sentences. The test set is 2006 NIST MT Evaluation
test set which consists of 1664 sentences, and the de-
velopment set is 2005 NIST MT Evaluation test set
which consists of 1084 sentences.

different approaches on two development sets.

5.2 Perplexity Analysis

We randomly divide the development set into five
subsets and conduct 5-fold cross-validation experi-
ments. In each trial, we tune the parameter µ in E-
quation (1) and parameter λ in Equation (18) with
four of five subsets and then apply it to one re-
maining subset. The experiments reported below are
those averaged over the five trials.

We estimate the generic 4-gram LM with the en-
tire LM training corpus as the baseline. Then, we se-
lect the top-N sentences which are similar to the de-
velopment set, estimate the bias 4-gram LMs (with
n-gram cutoffs tuned as above) with these selected
sentences, and interpolate with the generic 4-gram
LM as the adapted LMs. All the LMs are estimated
by the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002). Perplexity is
a metric of LM performance, and the lower perplexi-
ty value indicates the better performance. Therefore,
we estimate the perplexity of adapted LMs accord-
ing to English reference translations.

Figure 1 shows the perplexity of adapted LMs vs.
the size of selected data. In this paper, we choose
TF-IDF as the foundation of our solution since TF-
IDF has gained the state-of-the-art performance for
LM adaptation (Eck et al., 2004; Hildebrand et al.,
2005; Kim, 2005; Foster and Kuhn, 2007). CLS
refers to the cross-lingual similarity of (Ananthakr-
ishnan et al., 2011a), and CLSs is our proposed im-
proved algorithm on CLS with optimization mea-
sure like TF-IDF. CLWTM(β = 0) refers to S-
nover et al. (2008), which is the un-smooth ver-

sion of our proposed CLWTM in the document s-
tate. CLPTM(l = 4) is our proposed CLPTM with
a maximum phrase length of four, and we score the
target sentences by the highest scoring Q/S pair.

The results in Figure 1 indicate that English ref-
erence translations based perplexity of adapted LMs
decreases consistently with increase of the size of
selected top-N sentences, and increases consistent-
ly after a certain size in all approaches. Therefore,
proper size of similar sentences with the transla-
tion task makes the adapted LM perform well, but
if too many noisy data are taken into the selected
sentences, the performance becomes worse. Similar
observations have been done by (Eck et al., 2004;

Axelrod et al., 2011). Furthermore, it is comforting
that our approaches (CLWTM and CLPTM(l = 4))
performs better and are more stable than other ap-
proaches.

According to the perplexity results in Figure 1,
we select the top 8K sentences on IWSLT-07 and
top 16K sentences on NIST-06 which are similar to
the test set for adapting LM, respectively. Table 1
shows English reference translations based perplex-
ity of adapted LMs on two test sets. Our approach-
es have significantly reduction in perplexity com-
pared with other approaches, and the results indicate
that adapted LMs are significantly better predictors
of the corresponding translation task at hand than
the generic LM. We use these adapted LMs for next
translation experiments to show the detailed perfor-
mance of selected training data for LM adaptation.

5.3 Translation Experiments

We carry out translation experiments on the test set
by hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) SMT (Chiang,
2005 and 2007) system to demonstrate the utility of
LM adaptation on improving SMT performance by
BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). The generic LM
and adapted LMs are estimated as above in perplexi-
ty analysis experiments. We use minimum error rate
training (Och, 2003) to tune the feature weights of
HPB for maximum BLEU score on the development
set with serval groups of different start weights.

Table 2 shows the main translation results on two

test sets, and the improvements are statistically sig-
nificant at the 95% confidence interval with respect
to the baseline. From the comparison results, we get
some clear trends:

(1) Cross-lingual data selection model outper-
forms the traditional approaches which utilize the
first pass translation hypotheses (row 4 vs. row2;
row 11 vs. row 9), but the detailed impact of noisy
data in the translation hypotheses on data selection
will be shown in the next section (section 5.4).

(2) CLWTM significantly outperforms CLSs (row
6 vs. row 4; row 13 vs. row 11), we suspect that
word-based TM makes more accurate cross-lingual
data selection model than single cross-lingual pro-
jection (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2011a).

(3) Compared with (Snover et al., 2008), adding
the smoothing mechanism in the sentence state for
CLWTM significantly improves the performance
(row 6 vs. row 5; row 13 vs. row 12).

(4) Phrase-based TM (CLPTM) significantly out-
performs the state-of-the-art approaches based on
bag-of-words models and word-based TM (row 7 vs.
row 2, row 4, row 5 and row 6; row 14 vs. row 9,
row 11, row 12 and row 13).

5.4 Impact of Noisy Data in the Translation
Hypotheses

The experiment results in Table 2 indicate the sec-
ond pass translation hypotheses (row 2 and row 9)
made by TF-IDF are better than the first pass trans-
lation hypotheses (row 1 and row 8), so we consid-
er that these translations have less noisy data. Thus,
they were considered as the new translation hypothe-
ses (the second pass) to select the similar sentences
for LM adaptation by TF-IDF.

Table 3 shows the impact of noisy data in the
translation hypotheses on the performance of adapt-
ed LMs. The observed improvement suggests that
better initial translations which have less noisy data

lead to better adapted LMs, and thereby better sec-
ond iteration translations. Therefore, it is advisable
to use cross-lingual data selection for LM adaptation
in SMT, which can address the problem of noisy pro-
liferation.

5.5 Impact of Phrase Length

The results in Table 4 show that longer phrases do
yield some visible improvement up to the maximum
length of four. This may suggest that some proper-
ties captured by longer phrases are also captured by
other features. The performances when the phrase
length is 1 are better than that of single word-based
TM (row 6 and row 13 in Table 2), this suspec-
t that the features in our linear ranking model are
useful. However, it will be instructive to explore the
methods of preserving the improvement generated
by longer phrase when more features are incorporat-
ed in the future work.

5.6 Impact of Eliminating Unimportant Words

Table 5 shows the results of EUW by TextRank al-
gorithm on the performance of CLTM for LM adap-
tation. Initial represents that we do not eliminate
unimportant words. Average number represents the
average number of words (the total word number in
Q and S) in cross-lingual data selection model. The
average number is reduced when unimportant words
are eliminated, from 19 to 12 on IWSLT-07 and from
37 to 24 on NIST-06, respectively. This makes the
cross-lingual data selection process become more
efficient. In CLWTM, the performance with EUW
is basically the same with that of the initial state; but
in CLPTM, EUW outperforms the initial state be-
cause TextRank algorithm utilizes the context infor-

contextual information.

6 Conclusions and Future Work

In this paper, we propose a novel TM based cross-
lingual data selection model for LM adaptation in
SMT, from word models to phrase models, and aims
to find the LM training corpus which are similar to
the translation task at hand. Unlike the general TM
in SMT, we explore the use of TextRank algorithm
to identify and eliminate unimportant words for cor-
pus preprocessing, and construct TM by importan-
t words. Compared with the traditional approach-
es which utilize the first pass translation hypothe-
ses, cross-lingual data selection avoids the prob-
lem of noisy proliferation. Furthermore, phrase T-
M based cross-lingual data selection is more effec-
tive than the traditional approaches based on bag-
of-words models and word-based TM, because it
captures contextual information in modeling the s-
election of phrase as a whole. Large-scale exper-
iments are conducted on LM perplexity and SMT
performance, and the results demonstrate that our
approach solves the two aforementioned disadvan-
tages and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-
art methods for LM adaptation.

There are some ways in which this research could
be continued in the future. First, we will utilize our
approach to mine large-scale corpora by distributed
infrastructure system, and investigate the use of our
approach for other domains, such as speech transla-
tion system. Second, the significant improvement of
LM adaptation based on cross-lingual data selection
is exciting, so it will be instructive to explore oth-
er knowledge based cross-lingual data selection for
LM adaptation, such as latent semantic model.
