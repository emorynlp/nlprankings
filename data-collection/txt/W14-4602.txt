 Using Irish NLP resources in Primary School Education 
 

 
 

  

 

Abstract 

This paper looks at the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources in primary school edu-
cation in     Ireland.  It shows how two Irish NLP resources, the Irish Finite State Transducer Mor-
phological Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002) and Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) were used 
as the underlying engines for two Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) resources for 
Irish. The IFSTME was used to supply verb conjugation information for a Verb Checker Component 
of a CALL resource, while Gramadóir was the underlying engine for a Writing Checker Component.  
The paper outlines the motivation behind the development of these resources which include trying to 
leverage some of the benefits of CALL for students studying Irish in primary school.  In order to de-
velop CALL materials that were not just an electronic form of a textbook, it was considered impor-
tant to incorporate existing NLP resources into the CALL materials.  This would have the benefit of 
not re-inventing the wheel and of using tools that had been designed and testing by a knowledgeable 
NLP researcher, rather than starting from scratch.  The paper reports on the successful development 
of the CALL resources and some positive feedback from students and teachers.  There are several 
non-technical reasons, mainly logistical, which hinder the deployment of Irish CALL resources in 
schools, but Irish NLP researchers should strive to disseminate their research and findings to a wider 
audience than usual, if they wish others to benefit from their work. 

1 Introduction 

This paper looks at how Irish NLP resources can be used in the development of Computer Assisted 
Language Learning (CALL) resources.  It reports on the motivation for using CALL and specifically 
NLP/CALL in the primary school context in Ireland.  Irish is a compulsory subject in primary schools 
in Ireland and most students spend 13 years studying the language (Murtagh, 2003), but it is not a par-
ticularly popular subject (Ó Riagáin and Ó Glíasáin, 1994, DCRGA, 2009) .  CALL has many poten-
tial benefits for the language learner and it is important the students learning Irish have access to reli-
able, good quality CALL resources.  However, it is difficult to develop such CALL resources, as usu-
ally a multi-disciplinary team is required, and such a team is often hard to assemble.  One approach is 
to try to adapt and reuse existing resources to speed up the development process and indeed, provide 
resources that might not otherwise exist. 

With this in mind, two existing NLP resources for Irish were used to develop CALL resources for 
students in the primary school context.  The use of the resources is not limited to primary school stu-
dents, but they were developed with these students as the target learning group.  The first tool that was 
used was the Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002).  It was used 
to provide verb conjugation information for the Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) of the CALL 
resources.  The aim of the VCC was to provide static and dynamic web pages with verb conjugation 
information and exercises/language games for the learner.  The second tool used was Gramadóir 
(Scannell, 2005).  It is a grammar checking tool and provided the underlying engine for the Writing 
Checker Component for the CALL resources.  A wrapper was placed around Gramadóir in order to 
adapt it for the target learners.  This included modifying the errors messages to be more young-learner 
friendly and separating spelling and grammar errors. CALL resources were developed using these

Irish NLP resources and deployed in two primary schools in Ireland.  The students were able to use the 
resources without any major difficulties, but long term use depends on factors other than the 
NLP/CALL integration ones.  However, in order to make use of the NLP resources that are currently 
available to CALL developers, it behoves NLP researchers to make their research widely available and 
comprehensible to a non-NLP knowledgeable audience.  Of course, CALL researchers should also try 
to interact with the NLP community for a fruitful exchange of ideas and knowledge. 

2 Background 

Irish used to be the lingua franca in Ireland many centuries ago, but this is no longer the case.  How-
ever, the vast majority of school students in Ireland study Irish for 13 years (Murtagh, 2003) in both 
primary and secondary school.  There are several challenges to the teaching of Irish, including attitude, 
potential pedagogical difficulties and lack of suitable resources (including computer-based resources).  
This section looks at the place of Irish in the primary school system in Ireland, the problem of lack of 
suitable, high-quality, reliable resources for Irish for learners in general and especially for primary 
school children.  It also looks at the role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer As-
sisted Language Learning (CALL) in the teaching and learning of Irish. 

 

2.1 Irish 

Irish is a morphologically-rich language that was the lingua-franca of the majority of people in Ireland 
until around the 17th century.  Its use started to decline around this time and today there are approxi-
mately 20,000 active speakers (Ó hÉallaithe, 2004).  Irish has had a complex, paradoxical socio-
cultural role in Ireland.  On the one hand, people in Ireland appreciate the importance of having a na-
tional language that is distinct to Ireland and understand its cultural role (DCRGA, 2009).  However, 
they are somewhat ambivalent about its role in the education system.    

2.2 Education 

There are several pedagogical issues with the teaching of Irish in schools in Ireland.  It is one of the 
core subjects and is taught on a daily basis.  Often there is a lack of interest on the part of the students 
and their parents.  Reasons such as ‘it’s a useless language, no one speaks it anymore’, or ‘why don’t 
they teach French/Chinese instead?’ are sometimes heard.  Some students find it difficult.  Eleven of 
the most commonly used verbs are highly irregular, which can be daunting and confusing for young 
learners.  There is also the issue with lack of resources.  Obviously, there is no large international 
market for Irish language primary school text books and publishers only have the internal market in 
Ireland.  This limits the financial incentive for publishers to provide materials for students.  In many 
primary schools, students have to pay for their own books, with some schools operating book rental 
schemes.  This means that for any schools there is little or no incentive to change the books series that 
they use for teaching Irish.  Furthermore, given the non-positive attitude some parents have towards 
the time/effort devoted to teaching and learning Irish in primary school, they are often not receptive to 
moving to a different book series if they do not have the option to buy pre-owned books for older chil-
dren in the school.  Harris and Murtagh (1999) and Hickey and Stenson (2010) provide a good over-
view of the Irish education field. 
 

2.3 Lack of Suitable Resources 

One possible strategy to incorporate a more modern approach is to use electronic resources.  However, 
many of the resources available are not particularly suitable for primary schools students, as they are 
aimed at adults or may not be very accurate.  Adults may be able to comprehend that the information 
that they see online may not be totally correct, but primary school students are not accustomed to this, 
as they expect the information to be correct all the time.  For example, an adult may understand that 
“The President has super powers” or “London is the capital of Ireland” may not be true, but a child 
may just accept it as fact.

2.4 NLP, Computer Assisted Language Learning and Irish 

Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) can help in the language learning process.  It can help 
with learner motivation (e.g. Murphy and Hurd, 2011) and provide a degree of privacy for students.  It 
enables students to repeat exercises and revise as often as they like – the computer will not tire of pro-
viding feedback to students (unlike, perhaps, a teacher in a classroom setting).  Students can work at 
their own pace when using CALL resources – something which can be helpful in a mixed-ability class.  
CALL can be useful when there is limited or no access to a teacher e.g. in a minority or endangered 
language scenario.  CALL can perhaps enhance the prestige of a minority language, by demonstrating 
that the language as an electronic and/or online presence.  All these potential benefits can accrue to 
CALL for Irish.  The problem is that there are several issues which hinder the development and de-
ployment of CALL resources for Irish.  From a CALL resource development point of view, the teach-
ers may not have the time, knowledge or the expertise to develop CALL materials.  There may not be 
the computing resources for the students to have access to the CALL materials.  These factors pertain 
for Irish in the primary school context.  The teachers cover all primary school subjects and, in general, 
are not trained linguists or Irish language specialists.  Furthermore, while they may have reasonable 
computing skill, they may not have the skills and knowledge necessary required to develop Irish 
CALL materials.  In many primary schools in Ireland, there may not be a computer in the classroom 
and so the students have to use a computer lab. Often, the computers are relatively old and are of a low 
specification, and the students have limited access to the lab.  In their weekly computer slot, the 
teacher has to decide to use the time for English, mathematics or other school subjects. 

Many CALL resources do not use any NLP e.g. the BBC Languages (World Service English) (BBC, 
2014) is a general CALL resource for English language learners.  Intelligent CALL (ICALL) mainly 
draws on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (Matthews, 
1993).  NLP technologies can be used in CALL resources for concordancing, morphological process-
ing and syntactic processing (Nerbonne, 2003).  There are many reasons why NLP technologies are 
not widely used in CALL.  NLP is inherently difficult and there are difficulties in integrating NLP in 
CALL resources.  NLP researchers and NLP research is not CALL-based and there are difficulties in 
visualising how NLP can be used in CALL resources.  Furthermore, there is a lack of knowledge 
amongst CALL practitioners about NLP, as the use of NLP in CALL has been driven by NLP special-
ists rather than CALL practitioners.  Another difficulty is that NLP tools and techniques are often de-
signed to work with correct input (Vandeventer Faltin, 2003) and language learners produce incorrect 
input.  Also, some NLP CALL projects concentrate on the functionality/content and neglect the User 
Interface (UI) and this makes it difficult for the non-expert user to use the resources.  However, there 
is a growing interest in NLP resources for language learners, particularly in the area of error detection 
(Leacock et al., 2014).  There have been some successful NLP CALL programs (e.g. ALICE-chan 
(Levin and Evans, 1995)), but there are not many good examples that demonstrate the ability of NLP 
in CALL.  Many NLP/CALL projects finish at the prototype stage and progress no further.  The issue 
of using NLP in CALL without a good pedagogical basis must also be noted. There are also some 
socio-cultural factors that must also be considered including the attitudes of teachers, learners and 
NLP researchers to the NLP/CALL field.  There are very few NLP resources available for Irish.  
However, two of these resources, the IFSTE and Gramadóir, are robust and informative and can be 
used in CALL resources for Irish and these are discussed below. 

3 Resources 

3.1 Approach 

As outlined above, there is a problem with the lack of suitable, high quality CALL resources for Irish.  
One potential solution to this problem is to use existing NLP resources for Irish in CALL resources for 
the language.  There are not too many such resources available for Irish, but two very useful resources 
are Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) and the Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (Uí Dhon-
nchadha, 2002) (henceforth, IFSTME).  These are both high-quality, reliable and accurate resources 
that are publicly available.  These resources were integrated into two Irish CALL resources for pri-
mary school children.  Gramadóir was used in a Writing Checker Component (WCC) and the IF-
STME was used in a Verb Conjugation Component (VCC).  The overall architecture ran on an Apache 

8



server, with static pages stored in the htdocs directory and dynamic pages stored in the cgi-bin 
directory.  XML technologies and Perl were core components of the CALL software. 

3.2 Verb Conjugation Component 

Uí Dhonnchadh’s (2002) Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (IFSTME) is a comprehen-
sive resource which supplies morphological information for Irish words and sentences.  The IFSTME 
was used to generate the verb conjugations for verbs in the past simple tense. 

The aim of the Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) is to provide a tool to produce static and ani-
mated verb conjugation web pages based on externally supplied verb data.  The underlying engine is 
an Irish Finite State Transducer Morphology Engine (IFSTME) (Uí Dhonnchadha, 2002).  It was 
combined with an animation tool (Koller, 2004) and a CALL Template (Ward, 2001) to provide an 
Irish verb learning tool for primary school students. Figure 1 shows the information flow for the VCC.  
The external source of verb information (i.e. the IFSTME) provides information on verbs to the VCC 
which uses the information in the CALL resources.

Figure 2 shows an overview of the VCC.  The external verb information (from the IFSTME) is 
combined with local code files and local configuration files in the VCC.  The teacher provided 
pedagogical input to the process.  The VCC combines this data with flash animation code to pro-
duce verb information files, activity files and report files for the learner to use.  The teacher can 
also see the report files.

The IFSTME provides an analyser and generator for Irish inflectional morphology for nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs.  Replace rule triggers (for stems and affixes) are combined with replace rules written 
as regular expressions (for word mutations) to produce a two-level morphological transducer for Irish.  
The VCC only uses a very small subset of the verb forms provided by the IME (there are 52 forms in 
all).  It has web pages for 20 verbs, in both static and dynamic forms.  Figure 3 shows the past indica-
tive information for bris (to break) supplied by the Irish Finite State Morphology Engine (Uí Dhon-
nchadha, 2002).  Note that the output is not intended to be used as presented by the end-user, hence the 
presence of ^FH and ^FS tags in Figure 3.  Figure 4 shows the animated verb page for bris (past 
tense).

3.3 Writing Checker Component 

The Writing Checker Component (WCC) provides a tool that checks the learner’s text input and pro-
vides feedback on spelling and grammar errors.  It adapts an externally supplied grammar checker, 
Gramadóir (Scannell, 2005) to the needs of primary school students.  Gramadóir is an open source 
grammar checker that has been implemented for Irish and it can be used on a variety of operating sys-
tems.  It is modular in design and provides separate components for sentence segmentation, spell 
checking, part-of-speech tagging and grammar checking.  It is easy to use and there is a simple com-
mand line interface and a web interface to the software.  It is corpus-based and is booted from web-
based corpora.  It is easy to port to other languages as the language developers’ pack provided is de-
signed so that no programming experience is required.  It is scalable.  Spell checking packages can be 
developed in a few hours, while the engine also accommodates the development of a full-scale gram-
mar checker.  

Gramadóir is an excellent, accurate Irish language resource.  It is aimed at linguistically-aware 
adults.  It can be used in white-box mode and be adapted to the needs of the users.  However, a black-
box approach was taken when developing a writing checker for primary school students.  Under this 
approach, the grammar error messages to the user were passed through a filter and substituted with 
more suitable error messages for the target learners. 

There was an initial pilot study to test the feasibility of the resources and there were several design 
modifications based on learner and teacher feedback.  For example, there was a need to convert the 
adult learner-oriented language of Gramadóir’s errors messages to language more appropriate to 
younger learners.  Some of the original Gramadóir’s error messages and their WCC equivalent are 
shown in Table 1.  Note that not all students would understand the words "urú" and "séimhiú" even 
thought the teacher may have explained them.  

There was a need to separate out spelling errors from grammar errors and an error classification file 
was used to classify Gramadóir’s errors as either grammar or spelling errors. Sometimes, Gramadóir 
failed to suggest any alternatives for spelling errors and the Levenshtein algorithm (implemented with 
code from Merriampark (2005)) was used to check suitable words from the local dictionary. The local 
dictionary consisted of words from the some class texts.  A word with a Levenshtien value of 1 was 
probably the word the student intended to use, while those with a value of 2 were probably suitable.  
There was also a need to be able to correct and resubmit a text.  The screen layout had to be changed 
so that more information could be viewed at once and to minimise scrolling.  A review of the errors 
detected and not detected by Gramdóir was required and certain adaptations were necessary.

Table 3 shows some sample learner text and some of the key error phrases used for spelling errors.  
The fact that neither Gramadóir nor the WCC was able to detect the word ‘picture’ is interesting, as it 
shows that they do not handle code-mixing, which would be quite common amongst primary school 
learners.  This could be an area of future interest.

4 Deployment and Evaluation 

4.1 Deployment 

The VCC and the WCC were used by primary schools students in two English-medium schools in Ire-
land.  One of the schools was a mainstream, standard school (School 1) and the other was a school in a 
disadvantaged area (School 2).  Ethical approval was applied for and obtained from the University’s 
Research Ethics Committee and the parents.  3rd (age 8 – 9) and 4th class students (age 9 - 10) from 
School 1 used the VCC and 4th class students from School 2 used the WCC.  The students used the 
resources over a period of several months on an ad-hoc basis.   

4.2 Evaluation 

Evaluation in the CALL field is complex.  Quantitative and qualitative evaluation and formative and 
summative evaluation are all important.  The VCC and WCC were evaluated using several different 
criteria.  The aim of using various different evaluation criteria was to try to evaluate the Irish CALL 
resources from different perspectives.  Chapelle’s (2001) and Colpaert’s (2004) CALL evaluation cri-
teria were used to evaluate the VCC and WCC as CALL artefacts.  The ICT4LT (2005) website which 
provides a CALL software evaluation checklist, was also used.  The limitations of the evaluations in-
clude that some of it is based on self-reporting by young learners and that it was a small scale study 
with irregular and uneven usage. 

The VCC was evaluated by the teacher and students in the mainstream school.  An anonymous 
questionnaire-based survey was completed by 20 students (6 students were missing on the day of the 
questionnaire).  There were both open and closed questions and students were encouraged to provide 
(negative) feedback.  With regards to the VCC, the students 40% liked the tool, 45% liked it a little 
and only 15% did not like it.  The majority found it helpful (45%) or a little helpful (35%), with only 
20% saying it was not helpful.  The majority preferred the animate mode (60%), over the static mode 
(15%), with 10% slightly preferring the animated mode, while 15% did not see the animated pages.  
The teacher found the resource useful as it was aligned with her teaching objectives for the class.  Ta-
ble 4 shows a summary of the student feedback on the VCC.

Students were also asked to give feedback after doing exercises/games with the VCC.  The total 

number of students who answered online was 22 (note that not all students answered all the questions).  
Most students (84%) reported that they found the verb pages at least somewhat helpful, with little dif-
ference between those who viewed the pages in static and animated modes.  It is interesting to note 
that more static mode students (26%) than animated mode students (10%) found the exercise/game 
hard.  Table 5 shows a summary of the online student feedback data on the VCC.

Table 5. Student Online Feedback on the Verb Conjugation Component 

 
Students who did not find the VCC helpful said that they know the verbs already or that it was 

boring.  Those who found it helpful said it “shows and tell what it means” and another reported that it 
cleared up confusion (“I was always getting confused and now I’m not”).  When asked about their 
preference between static and animated mode, students who preferred static mode said that they un-
derstand it when the teacher explains it or that they found the animation mode annoying.  Those who 
liked the animated mode said it was more enjoyable and it helped them.  A summary of students’ com-
ments about the VCC are shown in Table 6.  Note that the comments are provided as written by the 
students.

The teacher also provided an evaluation of the VCC.  She said that it had sufficient learning poten-
tial because it focused on verb conjugation forms and her students did well in the verb exercises.  She 
thought it was suitable for the learners, it was sufficiently challenging for them, it had the right level of 
difficulty and that the tasks were appropriate for them.  The teacher said that explicit exposure to verb 
conjugation forms was pedagogically appropriate for her students.  Note that another teacher was also 
involved in using and evaluating the VCC, but for external reasons was not able to use the resource to 
any  great extent and the findings from her class are excluded from the evaluation. 

Students in both schools used the WCC, but the findings here relate to the students in the main-
stream school, as the numbers who used the WCC in the disadvantaged school were limited.  The 
learners were asked to provide their feedback on the WCC via an anonymous open and closed ques-
tionnaire.  Nineteen students completed the survey (7 students were absent on the day of the survey).  
Students reported that they liked using the WCC (yes (20%) and a little (50%), but 28% did not like it 
and a minority (28%) did not find it helpful.  A sizeable minority reported that they did not understand 
the grammar error messages (42%) and spelling error messages (32%) and therefore, not surprisingly, 
many (grammar 47%, spelling 30%) said that they did not find them helpful.  Most students said that 
they corrected their grammar errors (75%) and spelling errors (59%), although the empirical data does 
confirm this.  It must be noted that only 11% said they liked writing in Irish and a majority (63%) said 
they would prefer to write in their copy than use the WCC. Table 7 provides a summary of the student 
feedback on the WCC.

Some of the reasons given for not finding it helpful included: “it was boring/hard”, “I already 

know how to write” or “I don’t like writing".  Those who thought it was helpful said it told them the 
errors in their texts.  Table 8 shows some of the students’ comments on the WCC.  Note the comments 
are paraphrased, based on comments provided by the students. 

 
 

Question Finding 
Why do you like/dislike writing in Irish? Like: It’s our national language 

Dislike: Hard, boring, hard spellings, accents 
Would you prefer the WCC or your copy for writing? WCC: tells you your mistakes 

Copy: easier, faster, no keyboard problems 
 

Table 8. Student Comments on the Writing Checker Component 
 
The mainstream school teacher also completed a questionnaire and the feedback was positive.  

The teacher said that the WCC was beneficial for the students and enabled the students to construct 
sentences and stories.   She felt that it was at an appropriate level for the learners as all the students 
could use the software.  She said that it helped to consolidate classroom work.  She said the main 
problem was that she did not know enough about computers herself.  The teacher in the disadvantaged 
school initially came up with the idea to distinguish between grammar and spelling errors, as spelling

errors were not a priority for her.  There were logistical difficulties for the teacher in that only four 
students (out of 17) were considered sufficiently competent to use and benefit from the WCC.  An-
other difficulty was the fact that the school computer lab was closed during the project academic year 
and students had to travel to another venue to actually use the WCC – this obviously is not ideal. 

Although both schools were boys-only schools in the same city, there are some significant differ-
ences between them.  In the mainstream school, the students use the recommended textbook for their 
class, while in the disadvantaged school the students use a textbook for a more junior year.  Also, 
more students are exempt from studying Irish in the disadvantaged school and there are fewer above-
average students.  Classroom management is more difficult and there are students leaving and return-
ing to class from attending sessions with special needs teachers.  This highlights the need to have 
flexible resources that can be used as the teacher sees fit.  While the teacher in the disadvantaged 
school appreciated what the CALL resources can provide, their usage would probably be on a more 
ad-hoc basis than in the mainstream school. 

From a CALL development point of view, it was relatively straightforward to use both Irish NLP 
tools.  The IFSTME provides comprehensive information on Irish verbs.  For pedagogical reasons, the 
VCC only uses a small subset of the information.  The students were learning only a limited set of 
verbs, mainly regular verbs and some important irregular ones. In theory, the VCC could be modified 
easily to incorporate a more complete list of verbs, persons and tenses (although this was not required 
for this group of students).  There were some difficulties in mapping and interpreting the conjugation 
changes for irregular verbs, but it must be noted that the IFSTME was not intended as a verb conjuga-
tion mechanism.  It was used in white-box mode (i.e. some internal knowledge of the software was 
required for the VCC), but overall it was worthwhile using the IFSTME.  Likewise, Gramadóir was a 
useful NLP resource for developing the WCC.  It was robust and reliable and it would not have been 
possible to build the WCC without it. 

5 Discussion 

The VCC and the WCC demonstrate that it is possible and feasible to develop pedagogical, targeted 
NLP CALL resources for Irish.  It helped that the two NLP tools used were robust and of a high qual-
ity.  The learners and teachers were unaware of the underlying technology (and this is desirable).  
However, as is often the case, the problems were logistical rather than technical (Egbert et al., 2002; 
Ward, 2007).  Access to computers and “space in the timetable” hindered the continued deployment of 
the Irish CALL resources. 

It is important for NLP researchers working with any language to disseminate their findings and 
make their resources available to people outside the NLP community.  It is even more important for 
NLP researchers working with minority languages to do so, as the resources are usually limited 
(Woodbury, 2003; Lam et al., 2014) and the pool of people working with the language small.  Speak-
ers, learners and other interested parties of minority languages are used to trying to do a lot with a lit-
tle, and making NLP resources available to them could lead to the development of resources not ini-
tially envisioned by the NLP researchers. 

6 Conclusion 

This paper reports on how two NLP resources for Irish (i.e. the IFSTME and Gramadóir) were used to 
develop CALL resources for primary school children learning Irish. It shows that these NLP resources 
for Irish can be adapted and used to develop appropriate CALL resources.  In order for the CALL ma-
terials to be successful, it is important that there is a seamless integration of the NLP tools in the 
CALL resources, so that the learner is unaware of their existence.  Suitable, robust and accurate NLP 
resources are required, if the CALL materials are to work in a real deployment situation.  The CALL 
resource should not fail or be inaccurate. The integration of the CALL resources with the curriculum 
itself is key if the resources are actually going to be used by the teacher and the students (Bull and 
Zakrzewski, 1997, Mc Carthy, 1999; Ward, 2007).  This applies regardless of the language being stud-
ied – if the CALL resources do not help the teacher and aligned with the curriculum, they will not be 
used.  There are other, non-technical, non-NLP related factors that help or hinder the actual usage of 
CALL resources.  It should be noted that in order for the NLP resources to be used in the first place, 
there needs to be an awareness of their existence - teachers and CALL developers must know that 

15



relevant NLP resources are available.  This places an onus on NLP researchers to disseminate their 
research and tools to a wider audience than perhaps they would normally address.  They could interact 
with the CALL community via CALL conferences and especially with ICALL (Intelligent-CALL) 
researchers via their Special Interest Groups (SIGs), conferences and workshops. This is particularly 
pertinent in the minority and endangered language context (e.g. Irish and other Celtic languages), 
where technical, financial and researcher resources are limited.
