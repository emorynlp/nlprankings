Abstract

This paper describes a system for temporal
processing of text, which participated in the
Temporal Evaluations 2013 campaign. The
system employs a number of machine learning
classifiers to perform the core tasks of: identi-
fication of time expressions and events, recog-
nition of their attributes, and estimation of
temporal links between recognized events and
times. The central feature of the proposed sys-
tem is temporal parsing – an approach which
identifies temporal relation arguments (event-
event and event-timex pairs) and the semantic
label of the relation as a single decision.

1 Introduction

Temporal Evaluations 2013 (TempEval-3) is
the third iteration of temporal evaluations (after
TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007) and TempEval-
2 (Verhagen et al., 2010)) which addresses the
task of temporal information processing of text. In
contrast to the previous evaluation campaigns where
the temporal relation recognition task was simpli-
fied by restricting grammatical context (events in
adjacent sentences, events and times in the same
sentences) and proposed relation pairs, TempEval-3
does not set any context in which temporal re-
lations have to be identified. Thus, for temporal
relation recognition the challenges consist of: first,
detecting a pair of events, or an event and a time
that constitutes a temporal relation; and, second,
determining what semantic label to assign to the
proposed pair. Moreover, TempEval-3 proposes the
task of end-to-end temporal processing in which

events and times, their attributes and relations have
to be identified from a raw text input.

In this paper we present a data-driven approach
to all-around temporal processing of text. A num-
ber of machine-learning detectors were designed to
recognize temporal “markables” (events and times)
and their attributes. The key feature of our approach
is that argument pairs, as well as relations between
them, are jointly estimated without specifying in ad-
vance the context in which these pairs have to occur.

2 Our Approach

2.1 Timex Processing

2.1.1 Timex Recognition and Normalization
The proposed method for timex recognition im-

plements a supervised machine learning approach
that processes each chunk-phrase derived from the
parse tree. Time expressions are detected by the
model as phrasal chunks in the parse with their cor-
responding spans. In addition, the model is boot-
strapped by substitutions of temporal triggers with
their synonyms learned by the Latent Words Lan-
guage Model (Deschacht et al., 2012) as described in
(Kolomiyets et al., 2011). We implemented a logis-
tic regression model that makes use of the following
features:

• the head word of the phrase and its POS tag;
• all tokens and POS tags in the phrase as a bag

of words;
• the word-shape representation of the head word

and the entire phrase, e.g. Xxxxx 99 for the
expression April 30;

83



• the condensed word-shape representation for
the head word and the entire phrase, e.g. X(x)
(9) for the expression April 30;

• the concatenated string of the syntactic types of
the children of the phrase in the parse tree;

• the depth in the parse tree.

In addition, we considered a special label for sin-
gle tokens of time expressions. In this way, we
detect parts of temporal expressions if they cannot
be found in the chunk-based fashion. In detail, if
a token is recognized as part of a timex and satis-
fies the pre-condition on its POS tag, we employ a
“look-behind” rule for the phrasal chunk to match
the begin token of the temporal expression. The le-
gitimate start POS tags are determiners, adjectives,
and cardinals. Another set of rules specifies unsuit-
able timexes, such as single cardinals with values
outside predefined ranges of day-of-month, month-
of-year and year numbers.

Normalization of temporal expressions is a pro-
cess of estimating standard temporal values and
types for temporal expressions. Due to a large vari-
ance of expressions denoting the same date and
vagueness in language, rule-based approaches are
usually employed for the normalization task, and our
implementation is a rule-based system. The nor-
malization procedure is the same as described in
(Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010), which participated
in TempEval-2.

2.2 Event Processing

The proposed method to event recognition imple-
ments a supervised machine learning approach that
classifies every single token in the input sentence as
an event instance of a specific semantic type. We im-
plemented a logistic regression model with features
largely derived from the work of Bethard and Martin
(2006):

• the token, its lemma, coarse and fine-grained
POS tags, token’s suffixes and affixes;

• token’s hypernyms and derivations in Word-
Net;

• the grammatical class of the chunk, in which
the token occurs;

• the lemma of the governing verb of the token;
• phrasal chunks in the contextual window;

• the light verb feature for the governing verb;
• the polarity of the token’s context;
• the determiner of the token and the sentence’s

subject;

In addition, we classify the tense attribute for the
detected event by applying a set of thirteen hand-
crafted rules.

2.3 Temporal Relation Processing
Temporal relation recognition is the most difficult
task of temporal information processing, as it re-
quires recognitions of argument pairs, and subse-
quent classifications of relation types. Our ap-
proach employs a shift-reduce parsing technique,
which treats each document as a dependency struc-
ture of annotations labeled with temporal relations
(Kolomiyets et al., 2012). On the one hand, the ad-
vantage of the model is that the relation arguments
and the relation between them are extracted as a sin-
gle decision of a statistical classification model. On
the other hand, such a decision is local and might
not lead to the optimal global solution1. The follow-
ing features for deterministic shift-reduce temporal
parsing are employed:

• the token, its lemma, suffixes, coarse and fine-
grained POS tags;

• the governing verb, its POS tag and suffixes;
• the sentence’s root verb, its lemma and POS

tag;
• features for a prepositional phrase occurrence,

and domination by an auxiliary or modal verb;
• features for the presence of a temporal signal in

the chunk and co-occurrence in the same sen-
tence;

• a feature indicating if the sentence root verb
lemmas of the arguments are the same;

• the temporal relation between the argument and
the document creation time (DCT) (see below);

• a feature indicating if one argument is labeled
as a semantic role of the other;

• timex value generation pattern (e.g. YYYY-MM
for 2013-02, or PXY for P5Y) and timex
granularity (e.g. DAY-OF-MONTH for Friday,
MONTH-OF-YEAR for February etc.);

model we refer the reader to (Kolomiyets et al., 2012).

As one of the features above provides information
about the temporal relation between the argument
and the DCT, we employ an interval-based algebra
to classify relations between timexes and the DCT.
In case the argument is an event, we use a simple
logistic regression classifier with the following fea-
tures:

• the event token, its lemma, coarse and fine-
grained POS tags;

• tense, polarity, modality and aspect attributes;
• the token’s suffixes;
• the governing verb, its POS tag, tense and the

grammatical class of the chunk, in which the
event occurs;

• preceding tokens of the chunk;

3.1 Pre-Evaluation Results

The following results are obtained by 10-fold cross-
validations and corpus cross-validations with re-
spect to the evaluation criteria and metrics used in
TempEval-2. Tables 1 and 2 present the results for
the timex recognition and normalization tasks (Task
A), and, Tables 3 and 4 present the results for the
event recognition task (Task B).

As can be seen from the pre-evaluation results, the
most accurate classification of timexes on all cor-
pora in terms of F1 score is achieved for the model
trained on the Silver corpus. As for timex normaliza-
tion, the performances on TimeBank and the Silver

TE3RunABC) provides a full temporal informa-
tion processing pipeline (Task ABC), and the one
for Task C only (KUL-TaskC). For KULRun-1 we
employed the recognition models described above,
all trained on the aggregated corpus comprising
all three available training corpora in the evalua-
tions. For KUL-TE3RunABC we also trained the
markable recognition models on the aggregated cor-
pus, but the event recognition output was slightly
changed in order to merge multiple consequent
events of the same semantic class into a single multi-
token event. The temporal dependency parsing
model was trained on the TimeBank and AQUAINT
corpora only, with a reduced set of relation labels.
This decision was motivated by the time constraints
and the training time needed. The final relation la-
bel set contains the following temporal relation la-
bels: BEFORE, AFTER, DURING, DURING INV,
INCLUDES and IS INCLUDED. Below we present
the obtained results for each task separately. The re-
sults for Task A are presented in Tables 5 and 6, for
Task B in Tables 7 and 8, and, for Task ABC and
Task-C-only in Table 9. It is worth mentioning that
for Task B the aspect value was provided as NONE,
thus this evaluation criterion is not representative for
our system.

4 Conclusion

For TempEval-3 we proposed a number of statisti-
cal and rule-based approaches. For Task A we em-
ployed a logistic regression classifier whose output

as KULRun-1 and KULRun-2. Further in the paper, we refer to
this run as simply to KULRun-1.

was augmented by a small number of hand-crafted
rules to increase the recall. For the temporal ex-

86



pression normalization subtask we employed a rule-
based system which estimates the attribute values for
the recognized timexes. For Task B we proposed
a logistic regression classifier which processes in-
put tokens and classifies them as event instances of
particular semantic classes. The optional tense at-
tribute was estimated by a number of manually de-
signed rules. For the most difficult tasks, Task ABC
and Task C, we proposed a dependency parsing tech-
nique that jointly learns from data what arguments
constitute a temporal relation and what the temporal
relation label is. Due to evaluation time constraints
and the time needed to model training, we reduced
the set of relation labels and trained the model on
two small annotated corpora.

The evaluations evidenced that the use of larger
annotated data sets did not improve the timex recog-
nition performance as it was expected from the pre-
evaluations. Interestingly, we did not observe the ex-
pected improvement in terms of recall, as it was the
case in the pre-evaluations. Yet, the timex normal-
ization performance levels in the official evaluations
were slightly higher than in the pre-evaluations. In
contrast to timex recognition, the use of a large an-
notated corpus improved the results for event recog-
nition. The pilot implementation of a temporal
parser for newswire articles showed the lowest per-
formance in the evaluations for Task ABC, but still
provided decent results for Task C. One of the ad-
vantages of the proposed temporal parser is that the
parser selects arguments for a temporal relation and
classifies it at the same time. The decision is drawn
by a statistical model trained on the annotated data,
that is, the parser does not consider any particular
predefined grammatical context in which the relation
arguments have to be found. Another weak point of
the parser is that it requires a large volume of high-
quality annotations and long training times. The last
two facts made it impossible to fully evaluate the
proposed temporal parsing model, and we will fur-
ther investigate the effectiveness of the model.
