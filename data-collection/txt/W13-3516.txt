Abstract

Large-scale linguistically annotated cor-
pora have played a crucial role in advanc-
ing the state of the art of key natural lan-
guage technologies such as syntactic, se-
mantic and discourse analyzers, and they
serve as training data as well as evaluation
benchmarks. Up till now, however, most
of the evaluation has been done on mono-
lithic corpora such as the Penn Treebank,
the Proposition Bank. As a result, it is still
unclear how the state-of-the-art analyzers
perform in general on data from a vari-
ety of genres or domains. The completion
of the OntoNotes corpus, a large-scale,
multi-genre, multilingual corpus manually
annotated with syntactic, semantic and
discourse information, makes it possible
to perform such an evaluation. This paper
presents an analysis of the performance of
publicly available, state-of-the-art tools on
all layers and languages in the OntoNotes
v5.0 corpus. This should set the bench-
mark for future development of various
NLP components in syntax and semantics,
and possibly encourage research towards
an integrated system that makes use of the
various layers jointly to improve overall
performance.

1 Introduction
Roughly a million words of text from the Wall
Street Journal newswire (WSJ), circa 1989, has
had a significant impact on research in the lan-
guage processing community — especially those
in the area of syntax and (shallow) semantics, the
reason for this being the seminal impact of the
Penn Treebank project which first selected this text
for annotation. Taking advantage of a solid syn-
tactic foundation, later researchers who wanted to
annotate semantic phenomena on a relatively large
scale, also used it as the basis of their annota-
tion. For example the Proposition Bank (Palmer et
al., 2005), BBN Name Entity and Pronoun coref-
erence corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005),

the Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008),
and many other annotation projects, all annotate
the same underlying body of text. It was also con-
verted to dependency structures and other syntac-
tic formalisms such as CCG (Hockenmaier and
Steedman, 2002) and LTAG (Shen et al., 2008),
thereby creating an even bigger impact through
these additional syntactic resources. The most re-
cent one of these efforts is the OntoNotes corpus
(Weischedel et al., 2011). However, unlike the
previous extensions of the Treebank, in addition
to using roughly a third of the same WSJ subcor-
pus, OntoNotes also added several other genres,
and covers two other languages — Chinese and
Arabic: portions of the Chinese Treebank (Xue et
al., 2005) and the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri and
Bies, 2004) have been used to sample the genre of
text that they represent.

One of the current hurdles in language process-
ing is the problem of domain, or genre adaptation.
Although genre or domain are popular terms, their
definitions are still vague. In OntoNotes, “genre”
means a type of source – newswire (NW), broad-
cast news (BN), broadcast conversation (BC), mag-
azine (MZ), telephone conversation (TC), web data
(WB) or pivot text (PT). Changes in the entity and
event profiles across source types, and even in the
same source over a time duration, as explicitly ex-
pressed by surface lexical forms, usually account
for a lot of the decrease in performance of mod-
els trained on one source and tested on another,
usually because these are the salient cues that are
relied upon by statistical models.

Large-scale corpora annotated with multiple
layers of linguistic information exist in various
languages, but they typically consist of a single
source or collection. The Brown corpus, which
consists of multiple genres, have been usually used
to investigate issues of genres of sensitivity, but it
is relatively small and does not include any infor-

1A portion of the English data in the OntoNotes corpus
is a selected set of sentences that were annotated for parse
and word sense information. These sentences are present in a
document of their own, and so the documents for parse layers
for English are inflated by about 3655 documents and for the
word sense are inflated by about 8797 documents.

mal genres such as web data. Very seldom has it
been the case that the exact same phenomena have
been annotated on a broad cross-section of the
same language before OntoNotes. The OntoNotes
corpus thus provides an opportunity for studying
the genre effect on different syntactic, semantic
and discourse analyzers.

Parts of the OntoNotes Corpus have been used
for various shared tasks organized by the language
processing community. The word sense layer was
the subject of prediction in two SemEval-2007
tasks, and the coreference layer was the subject
of prediction in the SemEval-20102 (Recasens et
al., 2010), CoNLL-2011 and 2012 shared tasks
(Pradhan et al., 2011; Pradhan et al., 2012). The
CoNLL-2012 shared task provided predicted in-
formation to the participants, however, that did not
include a few layers such as the named entities
for Chinese and Arabic, propositions for Arabic,
and for better comparison of the English data with
the CoNLL-2011 task, a smaller OntoNotes v4.0
portion of the English parse and propositions was
used for training.

This paper is a first attempt at presenting a co-
herent high-level picture of the performance of
various publicly available state-of-the-art tools on
all the layers of OntoNotes in all three languages,
so as to pave the way for further explorations in
the area of syntax and semantics processing.

The possible avenues for exploratory studies
on various fronts are enormous. However, given
space considerations, in this paper, we will re-
strict our presentation of the performance on all
layers of annotation in the data by using a strat-
ified cross-section of the corpus for training, de-
velopment, and testing. The paper is organized
as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the
OntoNotes corpus. Section 3 explains the param-
eters of the evaluation and the various underlying
assumptions. Section 4 presents the experimental
results and discussion, and Section 5 concludes the
paper.

2 OntoNotes Corpus

The OntoNotes project has created a large-scale
corpus of accurate and integrated annotation of

multiple layers of syntactic, semantic and dis-
course information in text. The English lan-
guage portion comprises roughly 1.7M words and
Chinese language portion comprises roughly 1M
words of newswire, magazine articles, broadcast
news, broadcast conversations, web data and con-
versational speech data3. The Arabic portion is
smaller, comprising 300K words of newswire ar-
ticles. This rich, integrated annotation covering
many layers aims at facilitating the development
of richer, cross-layer models and enabling bet-
ter automatic semantic analysis. The corpus is
tagged with syntactic trees, propositions for most
verb and some noun instances, partial verb and
noun word senses, coreference, and named enti-
ties. Table 1 gives an overview of the number of
documents that have been annotated in the entire
OntoNotes corpus.

2.1 Layers of Annotation
This section provides a very concise overview of
the various layers of annotations in OntoNotes.
For a more detailed description, the reader is re-
ferred to (Weischedel et al., 2011) and the docu-
mentation accompanying the v5.04 release.

2.1.1 Syntax
This represents the layer of syntactic annotation
based on revised guidelines for the Penn Tree-
bank (Marcus et al., 1993; Babko-Malaya et al.,
2006), the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005)
and the Arabic Treebank (Maamouri and Bies,
2004). There were two updates made to the parse
trees as part of the OntoNotes project: i) the in-
troduction of NML phrases, in the English portion,
to mark nominal sub-constituents of flat NPs that
do not follow the default right-branching structure,
and ii) re-tokenization of hyphenated tokens into
multiple tokens in English and Chinese. The Ara-
bic Treebank on the other hand was also signifi-
cantly revised in an effort to increase consistency.

2.1.2 Word Sense
Coarse-grained word senses are tagged for the
most frequent polysemous verbs and nouns, in or-

3These numbers are for the portion that has all layers of
annotations. The word count for each layer is mentioned in
Table 1

OntoNotes v4.99 pre-release that was used for the CoNLL-
2012 shared task is identical to the v5.0 release.

der to maximize token coverage. The word sense
granularity is tailored to achieve very high inter-
annotator agreement as demonstrated by Palmer et
al. (2007). These senses are defined in the sense
inventory files. In the case of English and Arabic
languages, the sense-inventories (and frame files)
are defined separately for each part of speech that
is realized by the lemma in the text. For Chinese,
however the sense inventories (and frame files) are
defined per lemma – independent of the part of
speech realized in the text.

2.1.3 Proposition
The propositions in OntoNotes are PropBank-style
semantic roles for English, Chinese and Arabic.
Most English verbs and few nouns were anno-
tated using the revised guidelines for the English
PropBank (Babko-Malaya et al., 2006) as part of
the OntoNotes effort. Some enhancements were
made to the English PropBank and Treebank to
make them synchronize better with each other:
one of the outcomes of this effort was that two
types of LINKs that represent pragmatic coref-
erence (LINK-PCR) and selectional preferences
(LINK-SLC) were added to the original PropBank
(Palmer et al., 2005). More details can be found in
the addendum to the PropBank guidelines5 in the
OntoNotes v5.0 release. A part of speech agnostic
Chinese PropBank (Xue and Palmer, 2009) guide-
lines were used to annotate most frequent lem-
mas in Chinese. Many verbs and some nouns and
adjectives were annotated using the revised Ara-
bic PropBank guidelines (Palmer et al., 2008; Za-
ghouani et al., 2010).

2.1.4 Named Entities
The corpus was tagged with a set of 18 well-
defined proper named entity types that have been
tested extensively for inter-annotator agreement
by Weischedel and Burnstein (2005).

2.1.5 Coreference
This layer captures general anaphoric corefer-
ence that covers entities and events not limited
to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types
(Pradhan et al., 2007). It considers all pronouns
(PRP, PRP$), noun phrases (NP) and heads of verb
phrases (VP) as potential mentions. Unlike En-
glish, Chinese and Arabic have dropped subjects
and objects which were also considered during
coreference annotation6. The mentions formed by
these dropped pronouns total roughly about 11%
for both Chinese and Arabic. Coreference is the
only document-level phenomenon in OntoNotes.
Some of the documents in the corpus — especially
the ones in the broadcast conversation, web data,

5doc/propbank/english-propbank.pdf
6As we will see later these are not used during the task.

and telephone conversation genre — are very long
which prohibited efficient annotation in their en-
tirety. These are split into smaller parts, and each
part is considered a separate document for the sake
of coreference evaluation.

3 Evaluation Setting

Given the scope of the corpus and the multitude of
settings one can run evaluations, we had to restrict
this study to a relatively focused subset. There has
already been evidence of models trained on WSJ
doing poorly on non-WSJ data on parses (Gildea,
2001; McClosky et al., 2006), semantic role label-
ing (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005; Pradhan et al.,
2008), word sense (Escudero et al., 2000; ?), and
named entities. The phenomenon of coreference is
somewhat of an outlier. The winning system in the
CoNLL-2011 shared task was one that was com-
pletely rule-based and not directly trained on the
OntoNotes corpus. Given this overwhelming evi-
dence, we decided not to focus on potentially com-
plex cross-genre evaluations. Instead, we decided
on evaluating the performance on each layer of an-
notation using an appropriately selected, stratified
training, development and test set, so as to facili-
tate future studies.

3.1 Training, Development and Test
Partitions

In this section we will have a brief discussion
on the logic behind the partitioning of the data
into training, development and test sets. Before
we do that, it would help to know that given the
range and peculiarities of the layers of annota-
tion and presence of various resource and techni-
cal constraints, not all the documents in the cor-
pus are annotated with all the layers of informa-
tion, and token-centric phenomena (such as word
sense and propositions of predicates) were not an-
notated with 100% coverage. Most of the propo-
sition annotation in English and Arabic is for the
verb predicates, with a few nouns annotated in
English and some adjectives in Arabic. In Chi-
nese, the selection is part of speech agnostic, and is
based on the lemmas that can be considered predi-
cates. Some documents in the corpora are actually
snippets from larger documents, and have been an-
notated for a combination of parse, propositions,
word sense and names, but not coreference. If one
considers each layer independently, then an ideal
partitioning scheme would create a separate parti-
tion for each layer such that it maximizes the num-
ber of examples that can be extracted for that layer
from the corpus. The upside is that one would
get as much data there is to train and estimate the
performance of each layer across the entire cor-
pus. The downside is that this might cover vari-

145



ous cross sections of the documents in the corpus,
and would not provide a clean picture when look-
ing at the collective performance for all the lay-
ers. The documents that are annotated with coref-
erence correspond to the intersection of all anno-
tations. These are the documents that have also
been annotated with all the other layers of infor-
mation. The amount of data we can get together
in such a test set is big enough to be represen-
tative. Therefore, we decided that it would be
ideal to choose a portion of these documents as
the test collection for all layers. An additional ad-
vantage is that it is the exact same test set used
in the CoNLL-2012 shared task, and so in a way
is already a standard. On the training and devel-
opment side however, one can still imagine using
all possible information for training models for a
particular layer, and that is what we decided to
do. The training and development data is gener-
ated by providing all documents with all available
layers of annotation for input, however, the test
set is generated by providing as input to the algo-
rithm the set of documents in the corpus that have
been annotated for coreference. This algorithm
tries to reuse previously established partitions for
English, i.e., the WSJ portion. Unfortunately, in
the case of Chinese and Arabic, either the histor-
ical partitions were not in the selection used for
OntoNotes, or were partially overlapping with the
ones created using this scheme, and/or had a very
small portion of OntoNotes covered in the test set.
Therefore, we decided to create a fresh partition
for the Chinese and Arabic data. Note, however,
that the these test sets also match the ones used
in the CoNLL-2012 evaluation. The algorithm for
selecting the training, development and test parti-
tions is described on the CoNLL-2012 shared task
webpage, along with the list of training, develop-
ment, and test document IDs7.

3.2 Assumptions
Next we had to decide on a set of assumptions
to use while designing the experiments to mea-
sure the automatic prediction accuracy for each of
the layers. Since some of these decisions affect
more than one layer of annotation, we will de-
scribe these in this section instead of in the section
where we discuss the experiment with a particular
layer of annotation.

7http://conll.cemantix.org/2012/download/ids/
For each language there are two sub-directories — “all”
contains more general lists which include documents
that had at least one of the layers of annotation, and
“coref” contains the lists that include documents that
have coreference annotation. The former were used to
generate training, development, test sets for layers other
than coreference, and the latter was used to generate
training/development/test sets for the coreference layer
used in the CoNLL-2012 shared task.

Word Segmentation The three languages that
we are evaluating are from quite different lan-
guage families. Arabic has a complex morphol-
ogy, English has limited morphology, whereas
Chinese has very little morphology. English word
segmentation amounts to rule-based tokenization,
and is close to perfect. In the case of Chinese and
Arabic, although the tokenization/segmentation is
not as good as English, the accuracies are in the
high 90s. Given this we decided to use gold,
Treebank segmentation for all languages. In the
case of Chinese, the words themselves are lem-
mas, whereas in English they can be predicted
with very high accuracy. For Arabic, by default
written text is unvocalised, and lemmatization is a
complex process which we considered out of the
scope of this study, so we decided to use correct,
gold standard lemmas, along with the correct vo-
calized version of the tokens.

Traces and Function Tags Treebank traces
have hardly played a role in the mainstream parser
and semantic role labeling evaluation. Function
tags also have received similar treatment in the
parsing community, and though they are impor-
tant, there is also a significant information overlap
between them and the proposition structure pro-
vided by the PropBank layer. Whereas in English,
most traces represent syntactic phenomena such
as movement and raising, in Chinese and Arabic,
they can also represent dropped subjects/objects.
These subset of traces directly affect the corefer-
ence layer, since, unlike English, traces in Chinese
and Arabic (*pro* and * respectively) are legit-
imate targets of mentions and are considered for
coreference annotation in OntoNotes. Recovering
traces in text is a hard problem, and the most re-
cently reported numbers in literature for Chinese
are around a F-score of 50 (Yang and Xue, 2010;
Cai et al., 2011). For Arabic there have not been
much studies on recovering these. A study by
Gabbard (2010) shows that these can be recovered
with an F-score of 55 with automatic parses and
roughly 65 using gold parses. Considering the low
level of prediction accuracy of these tokens, and
their relative low frequency, we decided to con-
sider predicting traces in trees out of the scope of
this study. In other words, we removed the man-
ually identified traces and function tags from the
Treebanks across all three languages, in all the
three – training, development and test partitions.
This meant removing any and all dependent an-
notation in layers such as PropBank and Coref-
erence. In the case of PropBank these are the
argument bearing traces, whereas in coreference
these are the mentions formed by these elided sub-
jects/objects.

146



Disfluencies One thing that needs to be dealt
with in conversational data is the presence of dis-
fluencies (restarts, etc.). In the English parses of
the OntoNotes, disfluencies are marked using a
special EDITED8 phrase tag – as was the case for
the Switchboard Treebank. Computing the accu-
racy of identifying disfluencies is also out of the
scope of this study. Given the frequency of dis-
fluencies and the performance with which one can
identify them automatically,9 a probable process-
ing pipeline would filter them out before parsing.
We decided to remove them using oracle infor-
mation available in the English Treebank, and the
coreference chains were remapped to trees with-
out disfluencies. Owing to various technical con-
straints, we decided to retain the disfluencies in the
Chinese data.

Spoken Genre Given the scope of this study, we
make another significant assumption. For the spo-
ken genres – BC, BN and TC – we use the manual
transcriptions rather than the output of a speech
recognizer, as would be the case in real world. The
performance on various layers for these genres
would therefore be artificially inflated, and should
be taken into account while analyzing results. Not
many studies have previously reported on syntac-
tic and semantic analysis for spoken genre. Favre
et al. (2010) report the performance on the English
subset of an earlier version of OntoNotes.

Discourse The corpus contains information on
the speaker for broadcast communication, conver-
sation, telephone conversation and writer for the
web data. This information provides an important
clue for correctly linking anaphoric pronouns with
the right antecedents. This information could be
automatically deduced, but is also not within the
scope of our study. Therefore, we decided to pro-
vide gold, instead of predicted, data both during
training and testing. Table 2 lists the status of the
layers.

4 Experiments
In this section, we will report on the experiments
carried out using all available data in the train-
ing set for training models for a particular layer,
and using the CoNLL-2012 test set as the test set.

8There is another phrase type – EMBED in the telephone
conversation genre which is similar to the EDITED phrase
type, and sometimes identifies insertions, but sometimes con-
tains logical continuation of phrases by different speakers, so
we decided not to remove that from the data.

9A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one
can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational
speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 precision
and 67 recall.

that the layer is not applicable to the language.

The predicted annotation layers input to down-
stream models were automatically annotated by
using NLP processors learned with n-cross fold
validation on the training data. This way, the n
chunks of training data are annotated avoiding de-
pendencies with the data used for training the NLP
processors.

4.1 Syntax
Predicted parse trees for English were produced
using the Charniak parser11 (Charniak and John-
son, 2005). Some additional tag types used in
the OntoNotes trees were added to the parser’s
tagset, including the nominal (NML) tag, and the
rules used to determine head words were extended
correspondingly. Chinese and Arabic parses were
generated using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and
Klein, 2007). In the case of Arabic, the pars-
ing community uses a mapping from rich Arabic
part of speech tags to Penn-style part of speech
tags. We used the mapping that is included with
the Arabic Treebank. The predicted parses for
the training portion of the data were generated us-
ing 10-fold (5-folds for Arabic) cross-validation.
For testing, we used a model trained on the entire
training portion. Table 3 shows the precision, re-
call and F1-scores of the re-trained parsers on the
CoNLL-2012 test along with the part of speech ac-
curacies (POS) using the standard evalb scorer.

The performance on the PT genre for English is
the highest among other English genres. This is
possibly because of the professional, clean trans-
lations of the underlying text, and are mostly
shorter sentences. The MZ genre and the NW both
of which contain well edited text, share similar
scores. There is a few points gap between these
and the other genres. As for Chinese, the per-
formance on MZ is the highest followed by BN.
Surprisingly, the WB genre has a similar score and
the others are close behind except for TC. As ex-
pected, the Arabic parser performance is the low-

est among the three languages.

4.2 Word Sense
We used the IMS12 (It Makes Sense) (Zhong and
Ng, 2010) word sense tagger. IMS was trained on
all the word sense data that is present in the train-
ing portion of the OntoNotes corpus using cross-
validated predictions on the input layers similar
to the proposition tagger. During testing, for En-
glish and Arabic, IMS must first use the auto-
matic POS information to identify the nouns and
verbs in the test data, and then assign senses to
the automatically identified nouns and verbs. In
the case of Arabic, IMS uses gold lemmas. Since
automatic POS tagging is not perfect, IMS does
not always output a sense to all word tokens that
need to be sense tagged due to wrongly predicted
POS tags. As such, recall is not the same as pre-
cision on the English and Arabic test data. For
Chinese the measure of performance is just the
accuracy since the senses are defined per lemma
rather than per part of speech. Since we provide
gold word segmentation, IMS attempts to sense
tag all correctly segmented Chinese words, so re-
call and precision are the same and so is the F1-
score. Table 4 shows the performance of this clas-
sifier aggregated over both the verbs and nouns
in the CoNLL-2012 test set and an overall score
split by nouns and verbs for English and Ara-
bic. For both nouns and verbs in English, the
F1-score is over 80%. The performance on En-
glish nouns is slightly higher than English verbs.
Comparing to the other two languages, the perfor-
mance on Arabic is relatively lower, especially the
performance on Arabic verbs, whose F1-score is
less than 70%. For English, genres PT and TC,
and for Chinese genres TC and WB, no gold stan-
dard senses were available, and so their accuracies
could not be computed. Previously, Zhong et al.
(2008) reported the word sense performance on
the Wall Street Journal portion of an earlier ver-

4.3 Proposition
The revised PropBank has introduced two new
links — LINK-SLC and LINK-PCR. Since the com-
munity is not used to the new PropBank represen-
tation which (i) relies heavily on the trace struc-
ture in the Treebank and (ii) we decided to ex-
clude, we unfold the LINKs back to their original
representation as in the PropBank 1.0 release. We
used ASSERT15 (Pradhan et al., 2005) to predict
the propositional structure for English. We made
a small modification to ASSERT, and replaced
the TinySVM classifier with a CRF16 to speed
up training the model on all the data. The Chi-
nese propositional structure was predicted with the
Chinese semantic role labeler described in (Xue,
2008), retrained on the OntoNotes v5.0 data. The
Arabic propositional structure was predicted us-
ing the system described in Diab et al. (2008).

formance numbers17. The CoNLL-2005 scorer18
was used to compute the scores. At first glance,
the performance on the English newswire genre is
much lower than what has been reported for WSJ
Section 23. This could be attributed to several fac-
tors: i) the newswire in OntoNotes not only con-
tains WSJ data, but also Xinhua news, and some
other newswire evaluation data, ii) The WSJ train-
ing and test portions in OntoNotes are a subset of
the standard ones that have been used to report
performance earlier; iii) the PropBank guidelines
were significantly revised during the OntoNotes
project in order to synchronize well with the Tree-
bank, and finally iv) it includes propositions for
be verbs missing from the original PropBank. It
looks like the newly added Pivot Text data (com-
prised of the New Testament) shows very good
performance. The Chinese and Arabic19 accuracy
is much worse. In addition to automatically pre-
dicting the arguments, we also trained the IMS
system to tag PropBank frameset IDs.

4.4 Named Entities
We retrained the Stanford named entity recog-
nizer20 (Finkel et al., 2005) on the OntoNotes data.
Table 6 shows the performance details for all the
languages across all 18 name types broken down
by genre. In English, BN has the highest perfor-
mance followed by the NW genre. There is a sig-
nificant drop from those and the TC and WB genre.
Somewhat similar trend is observed in the Chi-
nese data, with Arabic having the lowest scores.
Since the Pivot Text portion (PT) of OntoNotes
was not tagged with names, we could not com-
pute the accuracy for that cross-section of the data.
Previously Finkel and Manning (2009) performed

a joint estimation of named entity and parsing.
However, it was on an earlier version of the En-
glish portion of OntoNotes using a different cross-
section for training and testing and therefore is not
directly comparable.

4.5 Coreference
The task is to automatically identify mentions of
entities and events in text and to link the corefer-
ring mentions together to form entity/event chains.
The coreference decisions are made using auto-
matically predicted information on other structural
and semantic layers including the parses, seman-
tic roles, word senses, and named entities that
were produced in the earlier sections. Each docu-
ment part from the documents that were split into
multiple parts during coreference annotation were
treated as separate document.

We used the number and gender predictions
generated by Bergsma and Lin (2006). Unfortu-
nately neither Arabic, nor Chinese have compara-
ble data available. Chinese, in particular, does not
have number or gender inflections for nouns, but
(Baran and Xue, 2011) look at a way to infer such
information.

We trained the Björkelund and Farkas (2012)
coreference system21 which uses a combination of
two pair-wise resolvers, the first is an incremen-
tal chain-based resolution algorithm (Björkelund
and Farkas, 2012), and the second is a best-first
resolver (Ng and Cardie, 2002). The two resolvers
are combined by stacking, i.e., the output of the
first resolver is used as features in the second one.
The system uses a large feature set tailored for
each language which, in addition to classic coref-
erence features, includes both lexical and syntactic
information.

Recently, it was discovered that there is pos-
sibly a bug in the official scorer used for the
CoNLL 2011/2012 and the SemEval 2010 corefer-
ence tasks. This relates to the mis-implementation
of the method proposed by (Cai and Strube, 2010)
for scoring predicted mentions. This issue has also
been recently reported in Recasens et al., (2013).
As of this writing, the BCUBED metric has been
fixed, and the correctness of the CEAFm, CEAFe
and BLANC metrics is being verified. We will
be updating the CoNLL shared task webpages22
with more detailed information and also release
the patched scripts as soon as they are available.
We will also re-generate the scores for previous
shared tasks, and the coreference layer in this pa-
per and make them available along with the mod-
els and system outputs for other layers. Table

Table 7: Performance of the coreference system
on the CoNLL-2012 test set.

The varying results across genres mostly meet
our expectations. In English, the system does best
on TC and the PT genres. The text in the TC set
often involve long chains where the speakers re-
fer to themselves which, given speaker informa-
tion, is fairly easy to resolve. The PT section
includes many references to god (e.g. god and
the lord) which the lexicalized resolver is quite
good at picking up during training. The more dif-
ficult genres consist of texts where references to
many entities are interleaved in the discourse and
is as such harder to resolve correctly. For Chi-
nese the numbers on the TC genre are also quite
good, and the explanation above also holds here
— many mentions refer to either of the speak-
ers. For Chinese the NW section displays by far
the highest scores, however, and the reason for
this is not clear to us. Not surprisingly, restricting
the set of mentions only to gold mentions gives
a large boost across all genres and all languages.
This shows that mention detection (MD) and sin-
gleton detection (which is not part of the annota-
tion) remain a big source of errors for the coref-
erence resolver. For these experiments we used
a combination of training and development data
for training — following the CoNLL-2012 shared

task specification. Leaving out the development
set has a very negligible effect on the CoNLL-
score for all the languages (English: 0.14; Chi-
nese 0.06; Arabic: 0.40 F-score respectively). The
effect on Arabic is the most (0.40 F-score) most
likely because of its much smaller size. To gauge
the performance improvement between 2011 and
2012 shared tasks, we performed a clean com-
parison of over the best performing system and
an earlier version of this system (Björkelund and
Nugues, 2011) on the CoNLL 2011 test set us-
ing the CoNLL 2011 train and development set
for training. The current system has a CoNLL
score of 60.09 (64.92+69.84+45.513 )

23 as opposed to
the 54.53 reported in björkelund (Björkelund and
Nugues, 2011), and the 57.79 reported for the best
performing system of CoNLL-2011. One caveat
is that these score comparison are done using the
earlier version (v4) of the CoNLL scorer. Nev-
ertheless, it is encouraging to see that within a
short span of a year, there has been significant
improvement in system performance – partially
owing to cross-pollination of research generated
through the shared tasks.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we reported work on finding a rea-
sonable training, development and test split for
the various layers of annotation in the OntoNotes
v5.0 corpus, which consists of multiple genres in
three typologically very different languages. We
also presented the performance of publicly avail-
able, state-of-the-art algorithms on all the different
layers of the corpus for the different languages.
The trained models as well as their output will
be made publicly available24 to serve as bench-
marks for language processing community. Train-
ing so many different NLP components is very
time-consuming, thus, we hope the work reported
here has lifted the burden of having to create rea-
sonable baselines for researchers who wish to use
this corpus to evaluate their systems. We created
just one data split in training, development and test
set, covering a collection of genres for each layer
of annotation in each language in order to keep the
workload manageable However, the results do not
discriminate the performance on individual gen-
res: we believe such a setup is still a more realistic
gauge for the performance of the state-of-the-art
NLP components than a monolithic corpus such
as the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Tree-
bank. It can be used as a starting point for devel-
oping the next generation of NLP components that
are more robust and perform well on a multitude
of genres for a variety of different languages.
