Abstract
We demonstrate a method of improving a seed
sentiment lexicon developed on essay data by
using a pivot-based paraphrasing system for
lexical expansion coupled with sentiment pro-
file enrichment using crowdsourcing. Profile
enrichment alone yields up to 15% improve-
ment in the accuracy of the seed lexicon on 3-
way sentence-level sentiment polarity classifi-
cation of essay data. Using lexical expansion
in addition to sentiment profiles provides a
further 7% improvement in performance. Ad-
ditional experiments show that the proposed
method is also effective with other subjectivity
lexicons and in a different domain of applica-
tion (product reviews).

1 Introduction

In almost any sub-field of computational linguistics,
creation of working systems starts with an invest-
ment in manually-generated or manually-annotated
data for computational exploration. In subjectivity
and sentiment analysis, annotation of training and
testing data and construction of subjectivity lexicons
have been the loci of costly labor investment.

Many subjectivity lexicons are mentioned in the
literature. The two large manually-built lexicons
for English – the General Inquirer (Stone et al.,
1966) and the lexicon provided with the Opinion-
Finder distribution (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) – are
available for research and education only1 and un-
der GNU GPL license that disallows their incor-
poration into proprietary materials,2 respectively.

Those wishing to integrate sentiment analysis into
products, along with those studying subjectivity in
languages other than English, or for specific do-
mains such as finance, or for particular genres
such as MySpace comments, reported construction
of lexicons (Taboada et al., 2011; Loughran and
McDonald, 2011; Thelwall et al., 2010; Rao and
Ravichandran, 2009; Jijkoun and Hofmann, 2009;
Pitel and Grefenstette, 2008; Mihalcea et al., 2007).

In this paper, we address the step of expanding
a small-scale, manually-built subjectivity lexicon (a
seed lexicon, typically for a domain or language
in question) into a much larger but noisier lexi-
con using an automatic procedure. We present
a novel expansion method using a state-of-the-art
paraphrasing system. The expansion yields a 4-fold
increase in lexicon size; yet, the expansion alone
is insufficient in order to improve performance on
sentence-level sentiment polarity classification.

In this paper we test the following hypothesis.
We suggest that the effectiveness of the expansion
is hampered by (1) introduction of opposite-polarity
items, such as introducing resolute as an expansion
of forceful, or remarkable as an expansion of pecu-
liar; (2) introduction of weakly polar, neutral, or am-
biguous words as expansions of polar seed words,
such as generating concern as an expansion of anx-
iety or future as an expansion of aftermath;3 (3) in-
ability to distinguish between stronger or clear-cut
versus weaker or ambiguous sentiment and to make
a differential use of those.

We address items (1) and (2) by enriching the lexi-
con with sentiment profiles (section 3), and propose

a way of effectively utilizing this information for
the sentence-level sentiment polarity classification
task (sections 5 and 6). Profile-enrichment alone
yields up to 15% increase in performance for the
seed lexicon when using different machine learning
algorithms; paraphraser-based expansion with sen-
timent profiles improves performance by an addi-
tional 7%. Overall, we observe an improvement of
up to 25% in classification accuracy over the seed
lexicon without profiles.

In section 7, we present comparative evaluations,
demonstrating the competitiveness of the expanded
and profile-enriched lexicon, as well as the effective-
ness of the expansion and enrichment paradigm pre-
sented here for different subjectivity lexicons, dif-
ferent lexical expansion methods, and in a different
domain of application (product reviews).

2 Building Subjectivity Lexicons

The goal of our sentiment analysis project is to allow
for the identification of sentiment in sentences that
appear in essay responses to a variety of tasks de-
signed to test English proficiency in both native- and
non-native-speaker populations in a standardized as-
sessment as well as in an instructional settings. In
order to allow for the future use of the sentiment
analyzer in a proprietory product and to ensure its fit
to the test-taker essay domain, we began our work
with the construction of a seed lexicon relying on
our materials (section 2.1). We then used a statisti-
cal paraphrasing system to expand the seed lexicon
(section 2.2).

2.1 Seed Lexicon

In order to inform the process of lexicon construc-
tion, we randomly sampled 5,000 essays from a cor-
pus of about 100,000 essays containing writing sam-
ples across many topics. Essays were responses
to several different writing assignments, including
graduate school entrance exams, non-native English
speaker proficiency exams, and professional licen-
sure exams. Our seed lexicon is a combination of
(1) positive and negative sentiment words manually
selected from a full list of word types in these data,
and (2) words marked in a small-scale annotation of
a sample of sentences from these data for all posi-
tive and negative words. A more detailed descrip-

tion of the construction of seed lexicon can be found
in Beigman Klebanov et al (2012). The seed lexi-
con contains 749 single words, 406 positive and 343
negative.

2.2 Expanded Lexicon
We used a pivot-based lexical and phrasal para-
phrase generation system (Madnani and Dorr, 2013).
The paraphraser implements the pivot-based method
as described by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005)
with several additional filtering mechanisms to in-
crease the precision of the extracted pairs. The
pivot-based method utilizes the inherent monolin-
gual semantic knowledge from bilingual corpora:
We first identify phrasal correspondences between
English and a given foreign language F , then map
from English to English by following translation
units from English to the other language and back.
For example, if the two English phrases e1 and e2
both correspond to the same foreign phrase f , then
they may be considered to be paraphrases of each
other with the following probability:

p(e1|e2) ≈ p(e1|f)p(f |e2)
If there are several pivot phrases that link the two

English phrases, then they are all used in computing
the probability:

p(e1|e2) ≈
∑

f ′
p(e1|f ′)p(f ′|e2)

Seed Expansion Seed Expansion
abuse exploitation costly onerous
accuse reproach dangerous unsafe
anxiety disquiet improve reinforce
conflict crisis invaluable precious

Table 1: Examples of paraphraser expansions.

Some examples of expansions generated by the
paraphraser are shown in Table 1. More details
about this kind of approach can be found in Ban-
nard and Callison-Burch (2005). We use the French-
English parallel corpus (approximately 1.2 million
sentences) from the corpus of European parliamen-
tary proceedings (Koehn, 2005) as the data on which
pivoting is performed to extract the paraphrases.
However, the base paraphrase system is susceptible

100



to large amounts of noise due to the imperfect bilin-
gual word alignments. Therefore, we implement ad-
ditional heuristics in order to minimize the num-
ber of noisy paraphrase pairs (Madnani and Dorr,
2013). For example, one such heuristic filters out
pairs where a function word may have been inferred
as a paraphrase of a content word. For the lexicon
expansion experiment reported here, we use the top
15 single-word paraphrases for every word from the
seed lexicon, excluding morphological variants of
the seed word. This process results in an expanded
lexicon of 2,994 different words, 1,666 positive and
1,761 negative (433 words are in both the positive
and the negative lists). The expanded lexicon in-
cludes the seed lexicon.

3 Inducing sentiment profiles

Let γw be the sentiment profile of the word w.

γw = (pposw , p
neg
w , p

neu
w ) (1)

where Σi∈{pos,neg,neu} piw = 1. Thus, a sentiment
profile of a word is essentially a 3-sided coin, cor-
responding to its probability of coming out positive,
negative, and neutral, respectively.

3.1 Estimating sentiment profiles
Our goal is to estimate the profile using outcomes of
multiple trials as follows. For every word, a person
is shown the word and asked whether it is positive,
negative, or neutral. A person’s decision is modeled
as flipping the coin corresponding to the word, and
recording the outcome – positive, negative, or neu-
tral. We run N=20 such trials for every word in the
expanded lexicon using the CrowdFlower crowd-
sourcing site,4 for a total cost of $800. We use maxi-
mum likelihood estimate of sentiment profile:

p̂iw = n
i
w (2)

where niw is the proportion ofN trials on the wordw
that fell in cell i ∈ {pos, neg, neu}. Table 2 shows
some estimated profiles.

Following Goodman (1965) and Quesenberry and
Hurst (1964), we calculate confidence intervals for
the parameters piw:

(p̂iw)
− = (B + 2niw − T )/(2(N +B)) (3)

Word p̂posw p̂neuw p̂

forceful 0 0.15 0.85
resolute 0.8 0.15 0.05
peculiar 0.05 0.15 0.8
remarkable 1 0 0
anxiety 0 0 1
concern 0.25 0.4 0.35
absurd 0 0 1
laughable 0.5 0.05 0.45
deadly 0 0 1
fateful 0.25 0.45 0.3
consequence 0.05 0.15 0.8
outcome 0.15 0.85 0

Table 2: Examples of estimated sentiment profiles.
Words in gray are expansions generated from words in
the preceding row; note the difference in the profiles.

(p̂iw)
+ = (B + 2niw + T )/(2(N +B)) (4)

where

T =
√
B[B + 4niw(N − niw)/N ]) (5)

For confidence α that all piw, i ∈ {pos, neg, neu}
are simultaneously within their respective intervals,
the value of B is determined as the upperα/3×100th
percentile of the χ2 distribution with one degree of
freedom. We use α=0.1, resulting in B=4.55. The
resulting interval is about 0.2 around the estimated
value when p̂iw is close to 0.5, and somewhat nar-
rower for p̂iw closer to 0 or 1. We will use this infor-
mation when inducing features from the profiles.

3.2 Sentiment distributions of the lexicons
The estimated sentiment profiles per word allow us
to visualize the distributions of the two lexicons. In
Figure 1, we plot the number of entries in the lexi-
con as a function of the difference in positive and
negative parts of the profile, in 0.2-wide bins. Thus,
a word w would be in the second-leftmost bin if
−0.8 < (p̂posw − p̂negw ) < −0.6.

While the expansion process more than doubles
the number of words in the highest bins for both
the positive and the negative polarity, it clearly
introduces a large number of words in the low-
and medium bins into the lexicon. It is in this
sense that the expansion process is noisy; appa-
rently, seed words with clear and strong polarity

4 Related Work

The most popular seed expansion methods discussed
in the literature are based on WordNet (Miller,
1995) or another lexicographic resource, on dis-
tributional similarity with the seeds, or on a mix-
ture thereof (Cruz et al., 2011; Baccianella et al.,
2010; Velikovich et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2009; Mo-
hammad et al., 2009; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006;
Kim and Hovy, 2004; Andreevskaia and Bergler,
2006; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kanayama and Nasukawa,
2006; Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004; Kamps et al.,
2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Turney and Littman,
2003; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997). The
paraphrase-based expansion method is in the dis-
tributional similarity camp; we also experimented
with WordNet-based expansion as descibed in sec-
tion 7.2.

The task of assigning sentiment profiles to words
in a sentiment lexicon has been addressed in the lite-
rature. SentiWordNet assigns profiles to all words in
WordNet based on a propagation algorithm from a
small seed set manually annotated by a small num-
ber of judges (Baccianella et al., 2010; Cerini et al.,
2007). Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) use graph
propagation algorithms on WordNet to assign cen-

trality scores in positive and negative categories; a
similar approach based on web-scale co-occurrence
graphs is discussed in Velikovich et al (2010). Thel-
wall et al (2010) manually annotated a set of words
for strength of sentiment and used machine learning
to fine-tune it. Taboada et al (2011) produced an
expert annotation of their lexicon with strength of
sentiment. Subasic and Huettner (2001) manually
built an affect lexicon with intensities. Wiebe and
Riloff (2005) classifed lexicon entries into weakly
and strongly subjective, based on their relative fre-
quency of appearance in subjective versus objective
contexts in a large annotated dataset.

Our sentiment profiles are best thought of as
relatively fine-grained priors for the sentiment ex-
pressed by a given word out-of-context. These re-
flect a mixture of strength of sentiment (p̂posgood >
p̂posdecent), contextual ambiguity (concern can be in-
terpreted as similar to worry or to care, as in “Her
condition was causing concern” versus “He showed
genuine concern for her”), and dominance of a po-
lar connotation (abandon is p̂neg=1; it has a negative
overtone even if the actual sense is not that of desert
but of vacate, as in “You must abandon your office”).

To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents
the first attempt to integrate judgements obtained
through crowdsourcing on a large scale into a sen-
timent lexicon, showing the effectiveness of this
lexicon-enrichment procedure for a sentiment clas-
sification task.

5 Using profiles for sentence-level
sentiment polarity classification

To evaluate the usefulness of the lexicons, we use
them to generate features for machine learning sys-
tems, and compare performance on 3-way sentence-
level sentiment polarity classification. To ensure ro-
bustness of the observed trends, we experiment with
a number of machine learning algorithms: SVM
Linear and RBF, Naı̈ve Bayes, Logistic Regression
(using WEKA (Hall et al., 2009)), and c5.0 Decision
Trees (Quinlan, 1993).5

5.1 Data

We generated the data for training and testing the
machine learning systems as follows. We used our

5available from http://rulequest.com/

pool of 100,000 essays to sample a second, non-
overlapping set of 5,000 essays, so that no essay
used for lexicon development appears in this set.
From these essays, we randomly sampled 550 sen-
tences, and submitted them to sentiment polarity an-
notation by two experienced research assistants; 50
double-annotated sentenced showed κ=0.8. TEST
set contains the 43 agreed double-annotated sen-
tences, and additional 238 sampled from the 500
single-annotated sentences, 281 sentence in total.
The category distribution in the TEST set is 46.6%
neutral, 32.4% positive, and 21% negative.

The TRAIN set contains the remaining sentences,
plus positive, negative, and neutral sentences anno-
tated during lexicon development, for the total of
1,631 sentences. The category distribution in TRAIN
is 39% neutral, 35% positive, 26% negative.

5.2 From lexicons to features
Our goal is to evaluate the impact of sentiment pro-
files on sentence-level sentiment polarity classifica-
tion for the seed and the expanded lexicons, while
also looking for the most effective ways to represent
this information for machine learners.

We implement two baseline systems. One pro-
vides the machine learner with the most detailed in-
formation contained in a lexicon: BL-full has 2 fea-
tures for every lexicon word, taking the values (1,0)
for positive match in a sentence, (0,1) – for negative,
(1,1) for a word in both positive and negative parts
of the lexicon, and (0,0) otherwise.

The second baseline provides the machine learner
with only summary information about the overall
sentiment of the sentence. BL-sum uses only 2 fea-
tures: (1) the total count of positive words in the
sentence; (2) the total count of negative words in the
sentence, according to the given lexicon.

For the sentiment-enriched runs, we construct a
number of representations: Int-full, Int-sum, Int-
bin, and Int-c. Int-full and Int-sum are parallel to
the respective baseline systems. Int-full represents
each lexicon word as 2 features corresponding to the
word’s estimated p̂posw and p̂

neg
w , providing the most

detailed information to the machine learner. In the
Int-sum condition, we use p̂posw and p̂negw for every
word to induce 2 features: (1) the sum of positive
probabilities of all words in the sentence; (2) the
sum of negative probabilities for all words in the

sentence, according to the given lexicon.
For Int-bin runs, we use bins of the size of 0.2 –

half of the maximal confidence interval – to group
together words with close estimates. We produce
10 features. For positive bins, the 5 features count
the number of words in the sentence that fall in
bini, 1 ≤ i ≤ 5, respectively, that is, words with
0.2(i− 1) < p̂posw ≤ 0.2i. Bin 1 also includes words
with p̂posw = 0, since these cannot be distinguished
with high confidence from p̂posw =0.1. Note that we
do not provide a scale, we merely represent different
ranges with different features. This should allow the
machine learners the flexibility to weight the diffe-
rent bins differently when inducing classifiers.

The Int-c condition represents a coarse-grained
setting. We produce 4 features, two for each pola-
rity: (1) the number of words such that 0 ≤ p̂posw <
0.4; (2) the number of words such that 0.4 ≤ p̂posw ≤
1; similarity for the negative polarity.

rity baseline corresponds to classifying all sentences as
neutral. The best performance is boldfaced. Let BL
stand for the best-performing baseline (BL-full or BL-
sum) for a combination of machine learner and lexicon.
We use Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, reporting the num-
ber of signed ranks (N) and the sum of signed ranks (W).
Statistically significant results at p=0.05 are: Int-sum >
BL (N=10, W=43); Int-bin > BL (N=10, W=48); Int-
bin > Int-sum (N=10, W=43); Int-bin > Int-full (N=10,

between Int-full, Int-c, and BL are not significant.

full or BL-sum) for a combination of machine
learner and lexicon. The results show that (1) Int-
bin > Int-sum > BL = Int-c = Int-full; (2) Ex-
panded > Seed under Int condition. All inequalities
are statistically significant at p=0.05 (see caption of
Table 4 for details).

First, both the seed and the expanded lexicons
benefit from profile enrichment, although, as pre-
dicted, the expanded lexicon yields larger gains due
to its more varied profiles: The seed lexicon gains up
to 15% in accuracy (c5.0 BL-sum vs Int-bin), while
the expanded lexicon gains up to 30%, as SVM RBF
scores go up from 0.495 to 0.644.

Second, observe that profiling allows the ex-
panded lexicon to leverage its improved coverage:
While it is inferior to the best baseline run with the
seed lexicon for all systems, it succeeds in impro-
ving the seed lexicon accuracies by 5%-12% across
the different systems for the Int-bin runs. The best
run of the expanded lexicon (Int-bin for SVM RBF)
improves upon the best run of the seed lexicon (Int-
sum for SVM-linear) by 7%, demonstrating the suc-
cess of the paraphraser-based expansion once pro-
files are taken into account. Overall, comparing the
best baseline for the seed lexicon with Int-bin con-
dition of the expanded lexicon, we observe an im-
provement between 5% (0.598 to 0.626 for Naı̈ve
Bayes) and 25% (0.512 to 0.641 for c5.0), proving
the effectiviness of the paraphrase-based expansion
with profile enrichment paradigm.

Third, representing profiles using 10 bins (Int-bin)
provides a small but consistent improvement over
the summary representation (Int-sum) that sums
positivity and negativity of the sentiment-bearing
words in a sentence, over a coarse-grained represen-
tation (Int-c), as well as over the full-information
representation (Int-full). Even Naı̈ve Bayes and
SVM linear, known to work well with large feature
sets, show better performance in the Int-bin con-
dition for the expanded lexicon. The results indi-
cate that an intermediate degree of detail – between
summary-only and coarse-grained representation on
the one hand and full-information representation on
the other – is the best choice in our setting.

7 Comparative Evaluations

In this section, we present comparative evaluations
of the work presented in this paper with respect to
related work. This section shows that the paraphrase
expansion+profile enrichment solution proposed in
this paper is effective for our task beyond off-the-
shelf solutions, and that its effectiveness generalizes
to sentiment analysis in a different domain. We also
show that profile enrichment can be effectively cou-
pled with other methods of lexical expansion, al-
though the paraphraser-based expansion receives a
larger boost in performance from profile enrichment
than the alternative expansion methods we consider.

In section 7.1, we demonstrate that the
paraphrase-based expansion and profile enrich-
ment yield superior performance on our data
relative to state-of-art subjectivity lexicons – Opin-
ionFinder, General Inquirer, and SentiWordNet.
In section 7.2, we show that profile enrichment
can be effectively coupled with other methods
of lexical expansion, such as a WordNet-based
expansion and an expansion that utilizes Lin’s
distributional thesaurus. However, we find that the
paraphraser-based expansion benefits the most from
profile enrichment, and attains better performance
on our data than the alterantive expansion methods.
In section 7.3, we show that the paraphrase-based
expansion and profile enrichment paradigm is
effective for other subjecitivy lexicons on other
data. We use a dataset of product reviews annotated
for sentence-level positivity and negativity as
new data for evaluation (Hu and Liu, 2004). We
use subsets of OpinionFinder, General Inquirer,
and sentiment lexicon from Hu and Liu (2004).
We demonstrate that paraphrase-based expansion
and profile enrichment improve the accuracy of
sentiment classification of product reviews for
every lexicon and machine learner combination; the
magnitude of improvement is 5% on average.

7.1 Competitiveness of the Expanded Lexicon

Had we been able to use the OpinionFinder or
the General Inquirer lexicons (OFL and GIL) as-
is, how would the results have compared to those
attained using our lexicons? We performed the
baseline runs with both lexicons; OFL accuracies
were 0.544-0.594 across machine learning systems,

GIL’s – 0.491-0.584 (see GIL column in Table 5).
We also experimented with using the weaksubj

and strongsubj labels in OFL as somewhat parallel
distinctions to the ones presented here (see sec-
tion 4 – Related Work – for a more detailed discus-
sion). We used (1,0,0) profile for strong positives,
(0.3,0,0.7) for weak positives, (0,1,0) for strong neg-
atives, and (0,0.3,0.7) for weak negatives, and ran all
the feature representations discussed in section 5.2.
Table 5 column OFL shows the best run for every
machine learning system, across the different feature
representations, and choosing the better performing
run between vanilla OFL and the version enriched
with weak/strong distinctions.

baseline performance of our seed lexicon – before para-
phraser expansion and profile enrichment were applied.
Exp. column shows the performance of Int-bin feature
representation for the expanded lexicon after profile en-
richment.

Additionally, we experimented with SentiWord-
Net (Baccianella et al., 2010). SentiWordNet is a
resource for opinion mining built on top of Word-
Net, which assigns each synset in WordNet a score
triplet (positive, negative, and objective), indicating
the strength of each of these three properties for the
words in the synset. The SentiWordNet annotations
were automatically generated, starting with a set of
manually labeled synsets. Currently, SentiWordNet
includes an automatic annotation for all the synsets
in WordNet, totaling more than 100,000 words. It
is therefore the largest-scale lexicon with intensity
information that is currently available.

Since SentiWordNet assigns scores to synsets and
since our data is not sense-tagged, we induced Sen-

105



tiWordNet scores in the following ways. We part-
of-speech tagged our train and test data using Stan-
ford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). Then, we took
the SentiWordNet scores for the top sense for the
given part-of-speech (SWN-1). In a different vari-
ant, we took a weighted average of the scores for the
different senses, using the weighting algorithm pro-
vided on SentiWordNet website6 (SWN-2). Table 5
column SWN shows the best performance figures
between SWN-1 and SWN-2, across the feature rep-
resentations in section 5.2.

The comparative results in Table 5 clearly show
that while our vanilla seed lexicon performs com-
parably to off-the-shelf lexicons on our data, the
paraphraser-expanded lexicon with sentitment pro-
files outperforms OpinionFinder, General Inquirer,
and SentiWordNet.

7.2 Sentiment Profile Enrichment with Other
Lexical Expansion Methods

We presented a novel lexicon expansion method
using a paraphrasing system. We also experimented
with more standard methods, using WordNet and
distributional similarity (Beigman Klebanov et al.,
2012; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Kim and Hovy,
2004; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Hu and Liu,
2004; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Strapparava
and Valitutti, 2004; Kamps et al., 2004; Takamura
et al., 2005; Turney and Littman, 2003; Hatzivas-
siloglou and McKeown, 1997). Specifically, we im-
plemented a WordNet (Miller, 1995) based expan-
sion that uses the 3 most frequent synonyms of the
top sense of the seed word (WN-e). We also imple-
mented a method based on distributional similarity:
Using Lin’s proximity-based thesaurus (Lin, 1998)
trained on our in-house essay data as well as on well-
formed newswire texts, we took all words with the
proximity score > 1.80 to any of the seed lexicon
words (Lin-e). Just like the paraphraser lexicon,
both perform worse than the seed lexicon in 9 out
of 10 baseline runs (BL-sum and Bl-full conditions
for the 5 machine learners).

To test the effect of profile enrichment, all words
in WN-e and Lin-e underwent profile estimation as
described in section 3.1, yielding lexicons WN-e-p
and Lin-e-p, respectively. Figure 2 shows the distri-

butions. WN-e-p and Lin-e-p exhibit similar trends
to those of the paraphraser. Substituting WN-e-p
for Expanded data in Table 4, we find the same re-
lationships between the different feature sets: Int-
bin>Int-sum>Int-full=BL. For Lin-e-p, Int-sum de-
teriorates: Int-bin>Int-sum=Int-full=BL. For the
20 runs in the Int condition, Paraphraser>WN-e-
p>Lin-e-p.7 Note that this is also the order of lexi-
con sizes: Lin-e is the most conservative expan-
sion (1,907 words), WN-e is the second with 2,527
words, and the lexicon expanded using paraphrasing
is the largest with 2,994 words. Table 6 shows the
performance of Lin-e-p, WN-e-p, and of the Ex-
panded lexicon from Table 4 using the Int-bin fea-
ture representation. The average relative improve-
ments over the best baseline range between 6.6% to
14.6% for the different expansion methods.

Profile induction appears to be a powerful lexicon
clean-up procedure that works especially well with
more aggressive and thus potentially noisier expan-
sions: The machine learners depress low-intensity
and ambiguous expansions, thereby allowing the
effective utilization of the improved coverage of
sentiment-bearing vocabulary.

and domains of application, we experimented with
a product reviews dataset (Hu and Liu, 2004) and
additional lexicons as follows.

7.3.1 Lexicons
We use the OpinionFinder and General Inquirer

lexicons (OFL and GIL) as before, as well as
the lexicon of positive and negative sentiment and
opinion words available along with (Hu and Liu,
2004) product reviews dataset – HL.8

Since each of these lexicons contains more than
3,000 words, enrichment of the full lexicons with
profiles is beyond the financial scope of our project.
We therefore restrict each of the lexicons to the size
of their overlap with our seed lexicon (see 2.1); the
overlaps have between 415 and 467 words. These re-
stricted lexicons are our initial lexicons for the new
experiment that parallel the role of the seed lexicon
in the experiments on essay data.

For each of the 3 initial lexicons L, L∈{OFL,
GIL, HL}, we follow the paraphrase-based expan-
sion as described in section 2.2. This results in about
4.5-fold expansion of each lexicon, the new lexi-
cons L-e, L∈{OFL, GIL, HL}, numbering between
2,015 and 2,167 words. Both the initial and the ex-
panded lexicons now undergo profile enrichment as
described in section 3.1, producing lexicons L-p and

8http://www.cs.uic.edu/∼liub/FBS/sentiment-
analysis.html#lexicon

L-e-p, L∈{OFL, GIL, HL}.
7.3.2 Data

We use the dataset from Hu and Liu (2004)9 that
contains reviews of 5 products from amazon.com:
two digital cameras, a DVD player, an MP3 player,
and a cellular phone. The reviews are annotated at
sentence level with a label that desrcibes the par-
ticular feature that is the subject of the positive or
negative evaluation and the polarity and extent of
the evaluation. For example, the sentence “The
phone book is very user-friendly and the speaker-
phone is excellent” is labeled as PHONE BOOK[+2],
SPEAKERPHONE[+2], while the sentence “I am
bored with the silver look” is labeled LOOK[−1]. We
used all sentences that were labeled with a numeri-
cal score for at least one feature, removing a small
number of sentences labeled with both positive and
negative scores for different features.10 We used the
sign of the numerical score to label the sentences as
positive or negative. The resulting dataset consists
of 1,695 sentences, 1,061 positive and 634 nega-
tive; accuracy for a majority baseline on this dataset
is 0.626. Our experiments on this dataset are done
using 5-fold cross-validation.

7.3.3 Results
Table 7 shows classification accuracies for the

product review data using different lexicons and ma-
chine learners. We observe that the combination of
paraphrase-based expansion and profile enrichment
(L-e-p column in the table) resulted in an improved
performance over the initial lexicon (L column in
the table) in all cases, with the average gain of 5%
in accuracy.

Furthermore, the contributions of the expansion
and the profile enrichment are complementary, since
their combination performs better than each in iso-
lation. We note that profile enrichment alone for the
initial lexicon did not yield an improvement. This
can be explained by the fact that the initial lexicons
are highly polar, so profiles provide little additional
information: The percentage of words with p̂pos ≥
0.8 or p̂neg ≥ 0.8 is 84%, 86% and 91% for GIL,

8 Conclusions

We demonstrated a method of improving a seed sen-
timent lexicon by using a pivot-based paraphrasing
system for lexical expansion and sentiment profile
enrichment using crowdsourcing. Profile enrich-
ment alone yielded up to 15% improvement in the
performance of the seed lexicon on the task of 3-
way sentence-level sentiment polarity classification
of test-taker essay data. While the lexical expansion
on its own failed to improve upon the performance
of the seed lexicon, it became much more effective

on top of sentiment profiles, generating a 7% perfor-
mance boost over the best profile-enriched run with
the seed lexicon. Overall, paraphrase-based expan-
sion coupled with profile enrichment yields an up to
25% improvement in accuracy.

Additionally, we showed that our paraphrase-
expanded and profile-enriched lexicon performs
significantly better on our data than off-the-shelf
subjectivity lexicons, namely, Opinion Finder, Gen-
eral Inquirer, and SentiWordNet. Furthermore, our
results suggest that paraphrase-based expansion de-
rives more benefit from profiles than two competing
expansion mechanisms based on WordNet and on
Lin’s distributional thesaurus.

Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the
paraphraser-based expansion with profile enrich-
ment paradigm on a different dataset. We used Hu
and Liu (2004) product review data with sentence-
level sentiment polarity labels. Paraphrase-based
expansion with profile enrichment yielded an im-
proved performance across all lexicons and machine
learning algorithms we tried, with an average im-
provement rate of 5% in classification accuracy.

Recent literature argues that sentiment polarity
is a property of word senses, rather than of words
(Gyamfi et al., 2009; Su and Markert, 2008; Wiebe
and Mihalcea, 2006), although Dragut et al (2012)
successfully operate with “mostly negative” and
“mostly positive” words based on the polarity distri-
butions of word senses. We plan to address in future
work sense disambiguation for words that have mul-
tiple senses with very different sentiment, such as
stress, as either anxiety (negative) or emphasis (neu-
tral).
