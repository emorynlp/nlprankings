Abstract

In this paper we present NLI-PT, the first Por-
tuguese dataset compiled for Native Language
Identification (NLI), the task of identifying
an author’s first language based on their sec-
ond language writing. The dataset includes
1,868 student essays written by learners of
European Portuguese, native speakers of the
following L1s: Chinese, English, Spanish,
German, Russian, French, Japanese, Italian,
Dutch, Tetum, Arabic, Polish, Korean, Roma-
nian, and Swedish. NLI-PT includes the origi-
nal student text and four different types of an-
notation: POS, fine-grained POS, constituency
parses, and dependency parses. NLI-PT can
be used not only in NLI but also in research
on several topics in the field of Second Lan-
guage Acquisition and educational NLP. We
discuss possible applications of this dataset
and present the results obtained for the first
lexical baseline system for Portuguese NLI.

1 Introduction

Several learner corpora have been compiled for
English, such as the International Corpus of
Learner English (Granger, 2003). The importance
of such resources has been increasingly recog-
nized across a variety of research areas, from Sec-
ond Language Acquisition to Natural Language
Processing. Recently, we have seen substantial
growth in this area and new corpora for languages
other than English have appeared. For Romance
languages, there are a several corpora and re-
sources for French1, Spanish (Lozano, 2010), and
Italian (Boyd et al., 2014).

Portuguese has also received attention in the
compilation of learner corpora. There are two
corpora compiled at the School of Arts and Hu-
manities of the University of Lisbon: the cor-

institutes/ilc/cecl/frida.html

pus Recolha de dados de Aprendizagem do Por-
tuguês Lı́ngua Estrangeira2 (hereafter, Leiria cor-
pus), with 470 texts and 70,500 tokens, and the
Learner Corpus of Portuguese as Second/Foreign
Language, COPLE23 (del Rı́o et al., 2016), with
1,058 texts and 201,921 tokens. The Corpus
de Produções Escritas de Aprendentes de PL2,
PEAPL24 compiled at the University of Coimbra,
contains 516 texts and 119,381 tokens. Finally, the
Corpus de Aquisição de L2, CAL25, compiled at
the New University of Lisbon, contains 1,380 texts
and 281,301 words, and it includes texts produced
by adults and children, as well as a spoken subset.

The aforementioned Portuguese learner corpora
contain very useful data for research, particularly
for Native Language Identification (NLI), a task
that has received much attention in recent years.
NLI is the task of determining the native language
(L1) of an author based on their second language
(L2) linguistic productions (Malmasi and Dras,
2017). NLI works by identifying language use
patterns that are common to groups of speakers
of the same native language. This process is un-
derpinned by the presupposition that an author’s
L1 disposes them towards certain language pro-
duction patterns in their L2, as influenced by their
mother tongue. A major motivation for NLI is
studying second language acquisition. NLI mod-
els can enable analysis of inter-L1 linguistic dif-
ferences, allowing us to study the language learn-
ing process and develop L1-specific pedagogical
methods and materials.

However, there are limitations to using exist-
ing Portuguese data for NLI. An important issue
is that the different corpora each contain data col-

lected from different L1 backgrounds in varying
amounts; they would need to be combined to have
sufficient data for an NLI study. Another chal-
lenge concerns the annotations as only two of the
corpora (PEAPL2 and COPLE2) are linguistically
annotated, and this is limited to POS tags. The dif-
ferent data formats used by each corpus presents
yet another challenge to their usage.

In this paper we present NLI-PT, a dataset col-
lected for Portuguese NLI. The dataset is made
freely available for research purposes.6 With the
goal of unifying learner data collected from var-
ious sources, listed in Section 3.1, we applied a
methodology which has been previously used for
the compilation of language variety corpora (Tan
et al., 2014). The data was converted to a uni-
fied data format and uniformly annotated at dif-
ferent linguistic levels as described in Section 3.2.
To the best of our knowledge, NLI-PT is the only
Portuguese dataset developed specifically for NLI,
this will open avenues for research in this area.

2 Related Work

NLI has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.
Due to the availability of suitable data, as dis-
cussed earlier, this attention has been particularly
focused on English. The most notable examples
are the two editions of the NLI shared task or-
ganized in 2013 (Tetreault et al., 2013) and 2017
(Malmasi et al., 2017).

Even though most NLI research has been car-
ried out on English data, an important research
trend in recent years has been the application of
NLI methods to other languages, as discussed in
Malmasi and Dras (2015). Recent NLI studies on
languages other than English include Arabic (Mal-
masi and Dras, 2014a) and Chinese (Malmasi and
Dras, 2014b; Wang et al., 2015). To the best of our
knowledge, no study has been published on Por-
tuguese and the NLI-PT dataset opens new possi-
bilities of research for Portuguese. In Section 4.1
we present the first simple baseline results for this
task.

Finally, as NLI-PT can be used in other applica-
tions besides NLI, it is important to point out that a
number of studies have been published on educa-
tional NLP applications for Portuguese and on the

identification-dataset

compilation of learner language resources for Por-
tuguese. Examples of such studies include gram-
matical error correction (Martins et al., 1998), au-
tomated essay scoring (Elliot, 2003), academic
word lists (Baptista et al., 2010), and the learner
corpora presented in the previous section.

3 Corpus Description

3.1 Collection methodology

The data was collected from three different learner
corpora of Portuguese: (i) COPLE2; (ii) Leiria
corpus, and (iii) PEAPL27 as presented in Table 3.

COPLE2 LEIRIA PEAPL2 TOTAL
Texts 1,058 330 480 1,868
Tokens 201,921 57,358 121,138 380,417
Types 9,373 4,504 6,808 20,685
TTR 0.05 0.08 0.06 0.05

Table 1: Distribution of the dataset: Number of texts,
tokens, types, and type/token ratio (TTER) per source
corpus.

The three corpora contain written productions
from learners of Portuguese with different profi-
ciency levels and native languages (L1s). In the
dataset we included all the data in COPLE2 and
sections of PEAPL2 and Leiria corpus.

The main variable we used for text selection
was the presence of specific L1s. Since the three
corpora consider different L1s, we decided to use
the L1s present in the largest corpus, COPLE2,
as the reference. Therefore, we included in the
dataset texts corresponding to the following 15
L1s: Chinese, English, Spanish, German, Russian,
French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Tetum, Arabic,
Polish, Korean, Romanian, and Swedish. It was
the case that some of the L1s present in COPLE2
were not documented in the other corpora. The
number of texts from each L1 is presented in Ta-
ble 2.

Concerning the corpus design, there is some
variability among the sources we used. Leiria cor-
pus and PEAPL2 followed a similar approach for
data collection and show a close design. They
consider a close list of topics, called “stimulus”,
which belong to three general areas: (i) the in-
dividual; (ii) the society; (iii) the environment.

7In the near future we want to incorporate also data from
the CAL2 corpus.

Table 2: Distribution by L1s and source corpora.

Those topics are presented to the students in or-
der to produce a written text. As a whole, texts
from PEAPL2 and Leiria represent 36 different
stimuli or topics in the dataset. In COPLE2 cor-
pus the written texts correspond to written exer-

cises done during Portuguese lessons, or to official
Portuguese proficiency tests. For this reason, the
topics considered in COPLE2 corpus are different
from the topics in Leiria and PEAPL2. The num-
ber of topics is also larger in COPLE2 corpus: 149
different topics. There is some overlap between
the different topics considered in COPLE2, that
is, some topics deal with the same subject. This
overlap allowed us to reorganize COPLE2 topics
in our dataset, reducing them to 112.

Table 3: Number of different topics by source.

Due to the different distribution of topics in the
source corpora, the 148 topics in the dataset are
not represented uniformly. Three topics account
for a 48.7% of the total texts and, on the other
hand, a 72% of the topics are represented by 1-
10 texts (Figure 1). This variability affects also
text length. The longest text has 787 tokens and

293

standard deviation of 103.

the shortest has only 16 tokens. Most texts, how-
ever, range roughly from 150 to 250 tokens. To
better understand the distribution of texts in terms
of word length we plot a histogram of all texts with
their word length in bins of 10 (1-10 tokens, 11-20
tokens, 21-30 tokens and so on) (Figure 2).

The three corpora use the proficiency levels de-
fined in the Common European Framework of
Reference for Languages (CEFR), but they show
differences in the number of levels they consider.
There are five proficiency levels in COPLE2 and
PEAPL2: A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1. But there are
3 levels in Leiria corpus: A, B, and C. The num-
ber of texts included from each proficiency level is
presented in Table 4.

3.2 Preprocessing and annotation of texts

As demonstrated earlier, these learner corpora use
different formats. COPLE2 is mainly codified in
XML, although it gives the possibility of getting
the student version of the essay in TXT format.
PEAPL2 and Leiria corpus are compiled in TXT
format.8 In both corpora, the TXT files contain the
student version with special annotations from the

8Currently there is a XML version of PEAPL2, but this
version was not available when we compiled the dataset.

transcription. For the NLI experiments we were
interested in a clean txt version of the students’
text, together with versions annotated at different
linguistics levels. Therefore, as a first step, we
removed all the annotations corresponding to the
transcription process in PEAPL2 and Leiria files.
As a second step, we proceeded to the linguistic
annotation of the texts using different NLP tools.

We annotated the dataset at two levels: Part of
Speech (POS) and syntax. We performed the an-
notation with freely available tools for the Por-
tuguese language. For POS we added a sim-
ple POS, that is, only type of word, and a fine-

294



grained POS, which is the type of word plus its
morphological features. We used the LX Parser
(Silva et al., 2010), for the simple POS and
the Portuguese morphological module of Freeling
(Padró and Stanilovsky, 2012), for detailed POS.
Concerning syntactic annotations, we included
constituency and dependency annotations. For
constituency parsing, we used the LX Parser, and
for dependency, the DepPattern toolkit (Otero and
González, 2012).

4 Applications

NLI-PT was developed primarily for NLI, but it
can be used for other research purposes ranging
from second language acquisition to educational
NLP applications. Here are a few examples of ap-
plications in which the dataset can be used:

• Computer-aided Language Learning
(CALL): CALL software has been de-
veloped for Portuguese (Marujo et al., 2009).
Further improvements in these tools can take
advantage of the training material available
in NLI-PT for a number of purposes such as
L1-tailored exercise design.

• Grammatical error detection and correction:
as discussed in Zampieri and Tan (2014), a
known challenge in this task is acquiring suit-
able training data to account for the vari-
ation of errors present in non-native texts.
One of the strategies developed to cope with
this problem is to generate artificial train-
ing data (Felice and Yuan, 2014). Augment-
ing training data using a suitable annotated
dataset such as NLI-PT can improve the qual-
ity of existing grammatical error correction
systems for Portuguese.

• Spellchecking: Studies have shown that
general-purpose spell checkers target perfor-
mance errors but fail to address many com-
petence errors committed by language learn-
ers (Rimrott and Heift, 2005). To address this
shortcoming a number of spell checking tools
have been developed for language learners
(Ndiaye and Faltin, 2003). Suitable training
data is required o develop these tools. NLI-
PT is a suitable resource to train learner spell
checkers for Portuguese.

• L1 interference: one of the aspects of non-
native language production that can be stud-

ied using data-driven methods is the influ-
ence of L1 in non-native speakers production.
Its annotation and the number of second lan-
guages included in the dataset make NLI-PT
a perfect fit for such studies.

4.1 A Baseline for Portuguese NLI
To demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset we
present the first lexical baseline for Portuguese
NLI using a sub-set of NLI-PT. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has been published on Por-
tuguese NLI and our work fills this gap.

In this experiment we included the five L1s in
NLI-PT which contain the largest number of texts
in this sub-set and run a simple linear SVM (Fan
et al., 2008) classifier using a bag of words model
to identify the L1 of each text. The languages
included in this experiment were Chinese (355
texts), English (236 texts), German (214 texts),
Italian (216 texts), and Spanish (271 texts).

We evaluated the model using stratified 10-fold
cross-validation, achieving 70% accuracy. An im-
portant limitation of this experiment is that it does
not account for topic bias, an important issue in
NLI (Malmasi, 2016). This is due to the fact that
NLI-PT is not balanced by topic and the model
could be learning topic associations instead.9 In
future work we would like to carry out using syn-
tactic features such as function words, syntactic
relations and POS annotation.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented NLI-PT, the first Portuguese
dataset compiled for NLI. NLI-PT contains 1,868
texts written by speakers of 15 L1s amounting to
over 380,000 tokens.

As discussed in Section 4, NLI-PT opens sev-
eral avenues for future research. It can be used
for different research purposes beyond NLI such
as grammatical error correction and CALL. An ex-
periment with the texts written by the speakers of
five L1s: Chinese, English, German, Italian, and
Spanish using a bag of words model achieved 70%
accuracy. We are currently experimenting with
different features taking advantage of the annota-
tion available in NLI-PT thus reducing topic bias
in classification.

In future work we would like to include more
texts in the dataset following the same methodol-
ogy and annotation.
