Abstract

The English ’s possessive construction oc-
curs frequently in text and can encode
several different semantic relations; how-
ever, it has received limited attention from
the computational linguistics community.
This paper describes the creation of a se-
mantic relation inventory covering the use
of ’s, an inter-annotator agreement study
to calculate how well humans can agree
on the relations, a large collection of pos-
sessives annotated according to the rela-
tions, and an accurate automatic annota-
tion system for labeling new examples.
Our 21,938 example dataset is by far the
largest annotated possessives dataset we
are aware of, and both our automatic clas-
sification system, which achieves 87.4%
accuracy in our classification experiment,
and our annotation data are publicly avail-
able.

1 Introduction

The English ’s possessive construction occurs fre-
quently in text—approximately 1.8 times for every
100 hundred words in the Penn Treebank1(Marcus
et al., 1993)—and can encode a number of
different semantic relations including ownership
(John’s car), part-of-whole (John’s arm), extent (6
hours’ drive), and location (America’s rivers). Ac-
curate automatic possessive interpretation could
aid many natural language processing (NLP) ap-
plications, especially those that build semantic
representations for text understanding, text gener-
ation, question answering, or information extrac-
tion. These interpretations could be valuable for
machine translation to or from languages that al-

the possessive/genitive.
This paper presents an inventory of 17 semantic

relations expressed by the English ’s-construction,
a large dataset annotated according to the this in-
ventory, and an accurate automatic classification
system. The final inter-annotator agreement study
achieved a strong level of agreement, 0.78 Fleiss’
Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) and the dataset is easily the
largest manually annotated dataset of possessive
constructions created to date. We show that our
automatic classication system is highly accurate,
achieving 87.4% accuracy on a held-out test set.

2 Background

Although the linguistics field has devoted signif-
icant effort to the English possessive (§6.1), the
computational linguistics community has given it
limited attention. By far the most notable excep-
tion to this is the line of work by Moldovan and
Badulescu (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005; Bad-
ulescu and Moldovan, 2009), who define a tax-
onomy of relations, annotate data, calculate inter-
annotator agreement, and perform automatic clas-
sification experiments. Badulescu and Moldovan
(2009) investigate both ’s-constructions and of
constructions in the same context using a list of 36
semantic relations (including OTHER). They take
their examples from a collection of 20,000 ran-
domly selected sentences from Los Angeles Times
news articles used in TREC-9. For the 960 ex-
tracted ’s-possessive examples, only 20 of their se-
mantic relations are observed, including OTHER,
with 8 of the observed relations occurring fewer
than 10 times. They report a 0.82 Kappa agree-
ment (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) for the two
computational semantics graduates who annotate
the data, stating that this strong result “can be ex-
plained by the instructions the annotators received

’s constructions in this work.

prior to annotation and by their expertise in Lexi-
cal Semantics.”

Moldovan and Badulescu experiment with sev-
eral different classification techniques. They find
that their semantic scattering technique signifi-
cantly outperforms their comparison systems with
its F-measure score of 78.75. Their SVM system
performs the worst with only 23.25% accuracy—
suprisingly low, especially considering that 220 of
the 960 ’s examples have the same label.

Unfortunately, Badulescu and Moldovan (2009)
have not publicly released their data2. Also, it is
sometimes difficult to understand the meaning of
the semantic relations, partly because most rela-
tions are only described by a single example and,
to a lesser extent, because the bulk of the given
examples are of -constructions. For example, why

lation but University of Texas is assigned to LOCA-
TION/SPACE is unclear. Their relations and pro-
vided examples are presented below in Table 1.

3 Dataset Creation

We created the dataset used in this work from
three different sources, each representing a distinct
genre—newswire, non-fiction, and fiction. Of the

2Email requests asking for relation definitions and the
data were not answered, and, thus, we are unable to provide
an informative comparison with their work.

21,938 total examples, 15,330 come from sections
2–21 of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
Another 5,266 examples are from The History of
the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Gib-
bon, 1776), a non-fiction work, and 1,342 are from
The Jungle Book (Kipling, 1894), a collection of
fictional short stories. For the Penn Treebank, we
extracted the examples using the provided gold
standard parse trees, whereas, for the latter cases,
we used the output of an open source parser (Tratz
and Hovy, 2011).

4 Semantic Relation Inventory

The initial semantic relation inventory for pos-
sessives was created by first examining some of
the relevant literature on possessives, including
work by Badulescu and Moldovan (2009), Barker
(1995), Quirk et al. (1985), Rosenbach (2002), and
Taylor (1996), and then manually annotating the
large dataset of examples. Similar examples were
grouped together to form initial categories, and
groups that were considered more difficult were
later reexamined in greater detail. Once all the
examples were assigned to initial categories, the
process of refining the definitions and annotations
began.

In total, 17 relations were created, not including
OTHER. They are shown in Table 3 along with ap-
proximate (best guess) mappings to relations de-
fined by others, specifically those of Quirk et al.
(1985), whose relations are presented in Table 2,
as well as Badulescu and Moldovan’s (2009) rela-
tions.

Relation Examples
POSSESSIVE my wife’s father
SUBJECTIVE boy’s application
OBJECTIVE the family’s support
ORIGIN the general’s letter
DESCRIPTIVE a women’s college
MEASURE ten days’ absense
ATTRIBUTE the victim’s courage
PARTITIVE the baby’s eye
APPOSITION (marginal) Dublin’s fair city

et al. (1985) for ’s along with some of their exam-

ing the annotation of a random set of 50 exam-
ples. Each set of examples was extracted such
that no two examples had an identical possessee
word. For a given example, annotators were in-
structed to select the most appropriate option but
could also record a second-best choice to provide
additional feedback. Figure 1 presents a screen-
shot of the HTML-based annotation interface. Af-
ter the annotation was complete for a given round,
agreement and entropy figures were calculated and
changes were made to the relation definitions and
dataset. The number of refinement rounds was ar-
bitrarily limited to five. To measure agreement,
in addition to calculating simple percentage agree-
ment, we computed Fleiss’ Kappa (Fleiss, 1971),
a measure of agreement that incorporates a cor-
rection for agreement due to chance, similar to
Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960), but which can be
used to measure agreement involving more than
two annotations per item. The agreement and en-
tropy figures for these five intermediate annotation
rounds are given in Table 4. In all the possessive
annotation tables, Annotator A refers to the pri-
mary author and the labels B and C refer to two
additional annotators.

To calculate a final measure of inter-annotator
agreement, we randomly drew 150 examples from
the dataset not used in the previous refinement it-
erations, with 50 examples coming from each of

the three original data sources. All three annota-
tors initially agreed on 82 of the 150 examples,
leaving 68 examples with at least some disagree-
ment, including 17 for which all three annotators
disagreed.

Annotators then engaged in a new task in which
they re-annotated these 68 examples, in each case
being able to select only from the definitions pre-
viously chosen for each example by at least one
annotator. No indication of who or how many
people had previously selected the definitions was

portion of the Penn Treebank.

given3. Annotators were instructed not to choose
a definition simply because they thought they had
chosen it before or because they thought some-
one else had chosen it. After the revision pro-
cess, all three annotators agreed in 109 cases and
all three disagreed in only 6 cases. During the re-
vision process, Annotator A made 8 changes, B
made 20 changes, and C made 33 changes. Anno-
tator A likely made the fewest changes because he,
as the primary author, spent a significant amount
of time thinking about, writing, and re-writing the
definitions used for the various iterations. Anno-
tator C’s annotation work tended to be less consis-
tent in general than Annotator B’s throughout this
work as well as in a different task not discussed
within this paper, which probably why Annotator
C made more changes than Annotator B. Prior to
this revision process, the three-way Fleiss’ Kappa
score was 0.60 but, afterwards, it was at 0.78. The
inter-annotator agreement and entropy figures for
before and after this revision process, including
pairwise scores between individual annotators, are
presented in Tables 5 and 6.

4.2 Distribution of Relations

The distribution of semantic relations varies some-
what by the data source. The Jungle Book’s dis-
tribution is significantly different from the oth-

ers, with a much larger percentage of PARTITIVE
and KINSHIP relations. The Penn Treebank and
The History of the Decline and Fall of the Ro-
man Empire were substantially more similar, al-
though there are notable differences. For instance,
the LOCATION and TEMPORAL relations almost
never occur in The History of the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire. Whether these differences
are due to variations in genre, time period, and/or
other factors would be an interesting topic for fu-
ture study. The distribution of relations for each
data source is presented in Figure 2.

Though it is harder to compare across datasets
using different annotation schemes, there are
at least a couple notable differences between
the distribution of relations for Badulescu and
Moldovan’s (2009) dataset and the distribution of
relations used in this work. One such difference is
the much higher percentage of examples labeled as
TEMPORAL—11.35% vs only 2.84% in our data.
Another difference is a higher incidence of the
KINSHIP relation (6.31% vs 3.39%), although it
is far less frequent than it is in The Jungle Book
(11.62%).

4.3 Encountered Ambiguities

One of the problems with creating a list of rela-
tions expressed by ’s-constructions is that some
examples can potentially fit into multiple cate-
gories. For example, Joe’s resentment encodes

375



both SUBJECTIVE relation and MENTAL EXPE-
RIENCER relations and UK’s cities encodes both
PARTITIVE and LOCATION relations. A represen-
tative list of these types of issues along with ex-
amples designed to illustrate them is presented in
Table 7.

5 Experiments

For the automatic classification experiments, we
set aside 10% of the data for test purposes, and
used the the remaining 90% for training. We used
5-fold cross-validation performed using the train-
ing data to tweak the included feature templates
and optimize training parameters.

5.1 Learning Approach
The LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) package was
used to train linear Support Vector Machine
(SVMs) for all the experiments in the one-against-
the-rest style. All training parameters took their
default values with the exception of the C pa-
rameter, which controls the tradeoff between mar-
gin width and training error and which was set to
0.02, the point of highest performance in the cross-
validation tuning.

5.2 Feature Generation
For feature generation, we conflated the pos-
sessive pronouns ‘his’, ‘her’, ‘my’, and ‘your’
to ‘person.’ Similarly, every term match-
ing the case-insensitive regular expression
(corp|co|plc|inc|ag|ltd|llc)\\.?) was replaced with
the word ‘corporation.’

All the features used are functions of the follow-
ing five words.

• The possessor word
• The possessee word
• The syntactic governor of the possessee word
• The set of words between the possessor and

possessee word (e.g., first in John’s first kiss)
• The word to the right of the possessee

The following feature templates are used to gener-
ate features from the above words. Many of these
templates utilize information from WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998).

• WordNet link types (link type list) (e.g., at-
tribute, hypernym, entailment)

• Lexicographer filenames (lexnames)—top
level categories used in WordNet (e.g.,
noun.body, verb.cognition)

• Set of words from the WordNet definitions
(gloss terms)

• The list of words connected via WordNet
part-of links (part words)

• The word’s text (the word itself)
• A collection of affix features (e.g., -ion, -er,

-ity, -ness, -ism)
• The last {2,3} letters of the word
• List of all possible parts-of-speech in Word-

Net for the word
• The part-of-speech assigned by the part-of-

speech tagger
• WordNet hypernyms
• WordNet synonyms
• Dependent words (all words linked as chil-

dren in the parse tree)
• Dependency relation to the word’s syntactic

governor

5.3 Results
The system predicted correct labels for 1,962 of
the 2,247 test examples, or 87.4%. The accuracy
figures for the test instances from the Penn Tree-
bank, The Jungle Book, and The History of the De-
cline and Fall of the Roman Empire were 88.8%,
84.7%, and 80.6%, respectively. The fact that the
score for The Jungle Book was the lowest is some-
what surprising considering it contains a high per-
centage of body part and kinship terms, which tend
to be straightforward, but this may be because the
other sources comprise approximately 94% of the
training examples.

Given that human agreement typically repre-
sents an upper bound on machine performance
in classification tasks, the 87.4% accuracy figure
may be somewhat surprising. One explanation is
that the examples pulled out for the inter-annotator
agreement study each had a unique possessee
word. For example, “expectations”, as in “ana-
lyst’s expectations”, occurs 26 times as the pos-
sessee in the dataset, but, for the inter-annotator
agreement study, at most one of these examples
could be included. More importantly, when the
initial relations were being defined, the data were
first sorted based upon the possessee and then the
possessor in order to create blocks of similar ex-
amples. Doing this allowed multiple examples to
be assigned to a category more quickly because
one can decide upon a category for the whole lot
at once and then just extract the few, if any, that be-
long to other categories. This is likely to be both
faster and more consistent than examining each

example in isolation. This advantage did not ex-
ist in the inter-annotator agreement study.

5.4 Feature Ablation Experiments

To evaluate the importance of the different types
of features, the same experiment was re-run multi-
ple times, each time including or excluding exactly
one feature template. Before each variation, the C

parameter was retuned using 5-fold cross valida-
tion on the training data. The results for these runs
are shown in Table 8.

Based upon the leave-one-out and only-one fea-
ture evaluation experiment results, it appears that
the possessee word is more important to classifica-
tion than the possessor word. The possessor word
is still valuable though, with it likely being more

377



valuable for certain categories (e.g., TEMPORAL
and LOCATION) than others (e.g., KINSHIP). Hy-
pernym and gloss term features proved to be about
equally valuable. Curiously, although hypernyms
are commonly used as features in NLP classifica-
tion tasks, gloss terms, which are rarely used for
these tasks, are approximately as useful, at least in
this particular context. This would be an interest-
ing result to examine in greater detail.

6 Related Work

6.1 Linguistics

Semantic relation inventories for the English ’s-
construction have been around for some time; Tay-
lor (1996) mentions a set of 6 relations enumerated
by Poutsma (1914–1916). Curiously, there is not
a single dominant semantic relation inventory for
possessives. A representative example of semantic
relation inventories for ’s-constructions is the one
given by Quirk et al. (1985) (presented earlier in
Section 2).

Interestingly, the set of relations expressed by
possessives varies by language. For example,
Classical Greek permits a standard of comparison
relation (e.g., “better than Plato”) (Nikiforidou,
1991), and, in Japanese, some relations are ex-
pressed in the opposite direction (e.g., “blue eye’s
doll”) while others are not (e.g., “Tanaka’s face”)
(Nishiguchi, 2009).

To explain how and why such seemingly dif-
ferent relations as whole+part and cause+effect
are expressed by the same linguistic phenomenon,
Nikiforidou (1991) pursues an approach of
metaphorical structuring in line with the work
of Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1987).
She thus proposes a variety of such metaphors as
THINGS THAT HAPPEN (TO US) ARE (OUR) POS-
SESSIONS and CAUSES ARE ORIGINS to explain
how the different relations expressed by posses-
sives extend from one another.

Certainly, not all, or even most, of the linguis-
tics literature on English possessives focuses on
creating lists of semantic relations. Much of the
work covering the semantics of the ’s construc-
tion in English, such as Barker’s (1995) work,
dwells on the split between cases of relational
nouns, such as sister, that, by their very definition,
hold a specific relation to other real or conceptual
things, and non-relational, or sortal nouns (Löb-
ner, 1985), such as car.

Vikner and Jensen’s (2002) approach for han-

dling these disparate cases is based upon Puste-
jovsky’s (1995) generative lexicon framework.
They coerce sortal nouns (e.g., car) into being
relational, purporting to create a uniform analy-
sis. They split lexical possession into four types:
inherent, part-whole, agentive, and control, with
agentive and control encompassing many, if not
most, of the cases involving sortal nouns.

A variety of other issues related to possessives
considered by the linguistics literature include ad-
jectival modifiers that significantly alter interpre-
tation (e.g., favorite and former), double geni-
tives (e.g., book of John’s), bare possessives (i.e.,
cases where the possessee is omitted, as in “Eat
at Joe’s”), possessive compounds (e.g., driver’s
license), the syntactic structure of possessives,
definitiveness, changes over the course of his-
tory, and differences between languages in terms
of which relations may be expressed by the geni-
tive. Representative work includes that by Barker
(1995), Taylor (1996), Heine (1997), Partee and
Borschev (1998), Rosenbach (2002), and Vikner
and Jensen (2002).

6.2 Computational Linguistics

Though the relation between nominals in the
English possessive construction has received lit-
tle attention from the NLP community, there is
a large body of work that focuses on similar
problems involving noun-noun relation interpreta-
tion/paraphrasing, including interpreting the rela-
tions between the components of noun compounds
(Butnariu et al., 2010), disambiguating preposition
senses (Litkowski and Hargraves, 2007), or anno-
tating the relation between nominals in more arbi-
trary constructions within the same sentence (Hen-
drickx et al., 2009).

Whereas some of these lines of work use fixed
inventories of semantic relations (Lauer, 1995;
Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Kim and Bald-
win, 2005; Girju, 2009; Ó Séaghdha and Copes-
take, 2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2010), other work al-
lows for a nearly infinite number of interpretations
(Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov, 2008). Recent
SemEval tasks (Butnariu et al., 2009; Hendrickx et
al., 2013) pursue this more open-ended strategy. In
these tasks, participating systems recover the im-
plicit predicate between the nouns in noun com-
pounds by creating potentially unique paraphrases
for each example. For instance, a system might
generate the paraphrase made of for the noun com-

Table 8: Results for leave-one-out and only-one feature template ablation experiment results for all
feature templates sorted by the only-one case. L, R, C, G, B, and N stand for left word (possessor), right
word (possessee), pairwise combination of outputs for possessor and possessee, syntactic governor of
possessee, all tokens between possessor and possessee, and the word next to the possessee (on the right),
respectively. The C parameter value used to train the SVMs is shown in parentheses.

pound pepperoni pizza. Computer-generated re-
sults are scored against a list of human-generated
options in order to rank the participating systems.
This approach could be applied to possessives in-
terpretation as well.

Concurrent with the lack of NLP research on
the subject is the absence of available annotated
datasets for training, evaluation, and analysis. The
NomBank project (Meyers et al., 2004) provides
coarse annotations for some of the possessive con-
structions in the Penn Treebank, but only those
that meet their criteria.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a semantic relation in-
ventory for ’s possessives consisting of 17 rela-
tions expressed by the English ’s construction, the

largest available manually-annotated collection of
possessives, and an effective method for automat-
ically assigning the relations to unseen examples.
We explain our methodology for building this in-
ventory and dataset and report a strong level of
inter-annotator agreement, reaching 0.78 Kappa
overall. The resulting dataset is quite large, at
21,938 instances, and crosses multiple domains,
including news, fiction, and historical non-fiction.
It is the only large fully-annotated publicly-
available collection of possessive examples that
we are aware of. The straightforward SVM-
based automatic classification system achieves
87.4% accuracy—the highest automatic posses-
sive interpretation accuracy figured reported to
date. These high results suggest that SVMs are
a good choice for automatic possessive interpre-

tation systems, in contrast to Moldovan and Bad-
ulescu (2005) findings. The data and software
presented in this paper are available for down-
load at http://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-
sw/fanseparser/index.html.

8 Future Work

Going forward, we would like to examine the var-
ious ambiguities of possessives described in Sec-
tion 4.3. Instead of trying to find the one-best
interpretation for a given possessive example, we
would like to produce a list of all appropriate in-
tepretations.

Another avenue for future research is to study
variation in possessive use across genres, includ-
ing scientific and technical genres. Similarly, one
could automatically process large volumes of text
from various time periods to investigate changes
in the use of the possessive over time.
