Abstract 

In this paper, we introduce SLQS, a new 
entropy-based measure for the unsupervised 
identification of hypernymy and its 
directionality in Distributional Semantic 
Models (DSMs). SLQS is assessed through 
two tasks: (i.) identifying the hypernym in 
hyponym-hypernym pairs, and (ii.) 
discriminating hypernymy among various 
semantic relations. In both tasks, SLQS 
outperforms other state-of-the-art measures. 

1 Introduction 

In recent years, Distributional Semantic Models 
(DSMs) have gained much attention in 
computational linguistics as unsupervised 
methods to build lexical semantic representations 
from corpus-derived co-occurrences encoded as 
distributional vectors (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney 
and Pantel, 2010). DSMs rely on the 
Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954) and 
model lexical semantic similarity as a function of 
distributional similarity, which is most 
commonly measured with the vector cosine 
(Turney and Pantel, 2010). DSMs have achieved 
impressive results in tasks such as synonym 
detection, semantic categorization, etc. (Padó and 
Lapata, 2007; Baroni and Lenci, 2010). 

One major shortcoming of current DSMs is 
that they are not able to discriminate among 
different types of semantic relations linking 
distributionally similar lexemes. For instance, the 
nearest neighbors of dog in vector spaces 
typically include hypernyms like animal, co-
hyponyms like cat, meronyms like tail, together 
with other words semantically related to dog. 
DSMs tell us how similar these words are to dog, 
but they do not give us a principled way to single 
out the items linked by a specific relation (e.g., 
hypernyms). 

Another related issue is to what extent 
distributional similarity, as currently measured 
by DSMs, is appropriate to model the semantic 
properties of a relation like hypernymy, which is 
crucial for Natural Language Processing. 
Similarity is by definition a symmetric notion (a 
is similar to b if and only if b is similar to a) and 
it can therefore naturally model symmetric 
semantic relations, such as synonymy and co-
hyponymy (Murphy, 2003). It is not clear, 
however, how this notion can also model 
hypernymy, which is asymmetric. In fact, it is 
not enough to say that animal is distributionally 
similar to dog. We must also account for the fact 
that animal is semantically broader than dog: 
every dog is an animal, but not every animal is a 
dog. 

38



In this paper, we introduce SLQS, a new 
entropy-based distributional measure that aims to 
identify hypernyms by providing a distributional 
characterization of their semantic generality. We 
assess it with two tasks: (i.) the identification of 
the broader term in hyponym-hypernym pairs 
(directionality task); (ii.) the discrimination of 
hypernymy among other semantic relations 
(detection task). Given the centrality of 
hypernymy, the relevance of the themes we 
address hardly needs any further motivation. 
Improving the ability of DSMs to identify 
hypernyms is in fact extremely important in tasks 
such as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) 
and ontology learning, as well as to enhance the 
cognitive plausibility of DSMs as general models 
of the semantic lexicon. 

2 Related work 

The problem of identifying asymmetric relations 
like hypernymy has so far been addressed in 
distributional semantics only in a limited way 
(Kotlerman et al., 2010) or treated through semi-
supervised approaches, such as pattern-based 
approaches (Hearst, 1992). The few works that 
have attempted a completely unsupervised 
approach to the identification of hypernymy in 
corpora have mostly relied on some versions of 
the Distributional Inclusion Hypothesis (DIH; 
Weeds and Weir, 2003; Weeds et al., 2004), 
according to which the contexts of a narrow term 
are also shared by the broad term. 

One of the first proposed measures 
formalizing the DIH is WeedsPrec (Weeds and 
Weir, 2003; Weeds et al., 2004), which 
quantifies the weights of the features f of a 
narrow term u that are included into the set of 
features of a broad term v: 

����������	, �� = ∑ ������∈��∩��∑ ������∈��
 

where Fx is the set of features of a term x, and 
wx(f) is the weight of the feature f of the term x. 
Variations of this measure have been introduced 
by Clarke (2009), Kotlerman et al. (2010) and 
Lenci and Benotto (2012). 

In this paper, we adopt a different approach, 
which is not based on DIH, but on the hypothesis 
that hypernyms are semantically more general 
than hyponyms, and therefore tend to occur in 
less informative contexts than hypernyms. 

3 SLQS: A new entropy-based measure 

DIH is grounded on an “extensional” definition 
of the asymmetric character of hypernymy: since 
the class (i.e., extension) denoted by a hyponym 
is included in the class denoted by the hypernym, 
hyponyms are expected to occur in a subset of 
the contexts of their hypernyms. However, it is 
also possible to provide an “intensional” 
definition of the same asymmetry. In fact, the 
typical characteristics making up the “intension” 
(i.e., concept) expressed by a hypernym (e.g., 
move or eat for animal) are semantically more 
general than the characteristics forming the 
“intension” of its hyponyms (e.g., bark or has fur 
for dog). This corresponds to the idea that 
superordinate terms like animal are less 
informative than their hyponyms (Murphy, 2002). 
From a distributional point of view, we can 
therefore expect that the most typical linguistic 
contexts of a hypernym are less informative than 
the most typical linguistic contexts of its 
hyponyms. In fact, contexts such as bark and has 
fur are likely to co-occur with a smaller number 
of words than move and eat. Starting from this 
hypothesis and using entropy as an estimate of 
context informativeness (Shannon, 1948), we 
propose SLQS, which measures the semantic 
generality of a word by the entropy of its 
statistically most prominent contexts. 

For every term wi we identify the N most 
associated contexts c (where N is a parameter 
empirically set to 50)1. The association strength 
has been calculated with Local Mutual 
Information (LMI; Evert, 2005). For each 
selected context c, we define its entropy H(c) as: 

                                                           

1 N=50 is the result of an optimization of the model 
against the dataset after trying the following 
suboptimal values: 5, 10, 25, 75 and 100.

where p(fi|c) is the probability of the feature fi 
given the context c, obtained through the ratio 
between the frequency of <c, fi> and the total 
frequency of c. The resulting values H(c) are 
then normalized in the range 0-1 by using the 
Min-Max-Scaling (Priddy and Keller, 2005): 
Hn(c). Finally, for each term wi we calculate the 
median entropy Ewi of its N contexts: 

()* = +�,&'- 	#�%��,�$ 

()*  can be considered as a semantic generality 
index for the term wi: the higher ()* , the more 
semantically general wi is. SLQS is then defined 
as the reciprocal difference between the semantic 
generality ()/ and ()0 of two terms w1 and w2: 

1231��', �"� = 1 −
()/
()0

 

According to this formula, SLQS<0, if ()/>()0; 
SLQS≃0, if ()/≃()0; and SLQS>0, if ()/<()0. 
SLQS is an asymmetric measure because, by 
definition, SLQS(w1,w2)≠SLQS(w2,w1) (except 
when w1 and w2 have exactly the same 
generality). Therefore, if SLQS(w1,w2)>0, w1 is 
semantically less general than w2. 

4 Experiments and evaluation 

4.1 The DSM and the dataset 

For the experiments, we used a standard 
window-based DSM recording co-occurrences 
with the nearest 2 content words to the left and 
right of each target word. Co-occurrences were 
extracted from a combination of the freely 
available ukWaC and WaCkypedia corpora (with 
1.915 billion and 820 million words, respectively) 
and weighted with LMI. 

To assess SLQS we relied on a subset of 
BLESS (Baroni and Lenci, 2011), a freely- 
available dataset that includes 200 distinct 
English concrete nouns as target concepts, 
equally divided between living and non-living 

entities (e.g. BIRD, FRUIT, etc.). For each target 
concept, BLESS contains several relata, 
connected to it through one relation, such as co-
hyponymy (COORD), hypernymy (HYPER), 

meronymy (MERO) or no-relation (RANDOM-N).2 

Since BLESS contains different numbers of 
pairs for every relation, we randomly extracted a 
subset of 1,277 pairs for each relation, where 
1,277 is the maximum number of HYPER-related 
pairs for which vectors existed in our DSM. 

4.2 Task 1: Directionality 

In this experiment we aimed at identifying the 
hypernym in the 1,277 hypernymy-related pairs 
of our dataset. Since the HYPER-related pairs in 
BLESS are in the order hyponym-hypernym (e.g. 
eagle-bird, eagle-animal, etc.), the hypernym in 
a pair (w1,w2) is correctly identified by SLQS, if 
SLQS (w1,w2) > 0. Following Weeds et al. (2004), 
we used word frequency as a baseline model. 
This baseline is grounded on the hypothesis that 
hypernyms are more frequent than hyponyms in 
corpora. Table 1 gives the evaluation results: 

 
SLQS WeedsPrec BASELINE 

POSITIVE 1111 805 844 

NEGATIVE 166 472 433 

TOTAL 1277 1277 1277 
PRECISION 87.00% 63.04% 66.09% 

Table 1. Accuracy for Task 1. 

As it can be seen in Table 1, SLQS scores a 
precision of 87% in identifying the second term 
of the test pairs as the hypernym. This result is 
particularly significant when compared to the 
one obtained by applying WeedsPrec (+23.96%). 
As it was also noticed by Geffet and Dagan 
(2005) with reference to a previous similar 
experiment performed on a different corpus 
(Weeds et al., 2004), the WeedsPrec precision in 
this task is comparable to the naïve baseline. 
SLQS scores instead a +20.91%. 

                                                           

2 In these experiments, we only consider the BLESS 
pairs containing a noun relatum.

4.3 Task 2: Detection 

The second experiment aimed at 
HYPER test pairs from those linked by other 

types of relations in BLESS (i.e.

and RANDOM-N). To this purpose, we assume
that hypernymy is characterized by two main 
properties: (i.) the hypernym and the hyponym 
are distributionally similar (in the sense of the 
Distributional Hypothesis), and 
hyponym is semantically less general than the 
hypernym. We measured the first property with 
the vector cosine and the second one with 

After calculating SLQS for all the pairs in our 
datasets, we set to zero all the negative values, 
that is to say those in which 
SLQS – the first term is semantically more 
general than the second one. Then,
SLQS and vector cosine by the
greater the resulting value, the greater the 
likelihood that we are considering a hypernymy
related pair, in which the first word is 
and the second word is a hypernym.

To evaluate the performance
used Average Precision (AP; Kotlerman et al., 
2010), a method derived from Information 
Retrieval that combines precision, relevance 
ranking and overall recall, returning a value that 
ranges from 0 to 1. AP=1 means that all the 
instances of a relation are in the top of the rank
whereas AP=0 means they are in the bottom

from BLESS. SLQS was also compared with
