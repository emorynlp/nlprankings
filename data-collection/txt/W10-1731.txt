Abstract

This paper describes the system developed
in collabaration between UCH and UPV
for the 2010 WMT. For this year’s work-
shop, we present a system for English-
Spanish translation. Output N -best lists
were rescored via a target Neural Network
Language Model, yielding improvements
in the final translation quality as measured
by BLEU and TER.

1 Introduction

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), the goal
is to translate a sentence f from a given source lan-
guage into an equivalent sentence ê from a certain
target language. Such statement is typically for-
malised by means of the so-called log-linear mod-
els (Papineni et al., 1998; Och and Ney, 2002) as
follows:

ê = argmax
e

K∑
k=1

λkhk(f , e) (1)

where hk(f , e) is a score function representing
an important feature for the translation of f into
e, K is the number of models (or features) and
λk are the weights of the log-linear combination.
Typically, the weights λk are optimised during
the tuning stage with the use of a development
set. Such features typically include the target lan-
guage model p(e), which is one of the core com-
ponents of an SMT system. In fact, most of the
times it is assigned a relatively high weight in the
log-linear combination described above. Tradi-
tionally, language modelling techniques have been
classified into two main groups, the first one in-
cluding traditional grammars such as context-free
grammars, and the second one comprising more
statistical, corpus-based models, such as n-gram
models. In order to assign a probability to a given

word, such models rely on the assumption that
such probability depends on the previous history,
i.e. the n − 1 preceding words in the utterance.
Nowadays, n-gram models have become a “de
facto” standard for language modelling in state-of-
the-art SMT systems.

In the present work, we present a system which
follows a coherent and natural evolution of prob-
abilistic Language Models. Specifically, we pro-
pose the use of a continuous space language model
trained in the form of a Neural Network Language
Model (NN LM).

The use of continuous space representation of
language has been successfully applied in recent
NN approaches to language modelling (Bengio et
al., 2003; Schwenk and Gauvain, 2002; Castro-
Bleda and Prat, 2003; Schwenk et al., 2006).
However, the use of Neural Network Language
Models (NN LMs) (Bengio, 2008) in state-of-the-
art SMT systems is not so popular. The only com-
prehensive work refers to (Schwenk, 2010), where
the target LM is presented in the form of a fully-
connected Multilayer Perceptron.

The presented system combines a standard,
state-of-the-art SMT system with a NN LM via
log-linear combination and N -best output re-
scoring. We chose to participate in the English-
Spanish direction.

2 Neural Network Language Models

In SMT the most extended language models are
n-grams (Bahl et al., 1983; Jelinek, 1997; Bahl et
al., 1983). They compute the probability of each
word given the context of the n−1 previous words:

p(s1 . . . s|S|) ≈
|S|∏
i=1

p(si|si−n+1 . . . si−1) . (2)

where S is the sequence of words for which we
want compute the probability, and si ∈ S, from a
vocabulary Ω.

A NN LM is a statistical LM which follows
equation (2) as n-grams do, but where the proba-
bilities that appear in that expression are estimated
with a NN (Bengio et al., 2003; Castro-Bleda and
Prat, 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Bengio, 2008). The
model naturally fits under the probabilistic inter-
pretation of the outputs of the NNs: if a NN, in this
case a MLP, is trained as a classifier, the outputs
associated to each class are estimations of the pos-
terior probabilities of the defined classes (Bishop,
1995).

The training set for a LM is a sequence
s1s2 . . . s|S| of words from a vocabulary Ω. In or-
der to train a NN to predict the next word given
a history of length n − 1, each input word must
be encoded. A natural representation is a local en-
coding following a “1-of-|Ω|” scheme. The prob-
lem of this encoding for tasks with large vocab-
ularies (as is typically the case) is the huge size
of the resulting NN. We have solved this prob-
lem following the ideas of (Bengio et al., 2003;
Schwenk, 2007), learning a distributed represen-
tation for each word. Figure 1 illustrates the archi-
tecture of the feed-forward NN used to estimate
the NN LM:

• The input is composed of words
si−n+1, . . . , si−1 of equation (2). Each
word is represented using a local encoding.

• P is the projection layer of the input words,
formed by Pi−n+1, . . . , Pi−1 subsets of pro-
jection units. The subset of projection units
Pj represents the distributed encoding of in-
put word sj . The weights of this projection
layer are linked, that is, the weights from
each local encoding of input word sj to the
corresponding subset of projection units Pj
are the same for all input words. After train-
ing, the codification layer is removed from
the network by pre-computing a table of size
|Ω| which serves as a distributed encoding.

• H denotes the hidden layer.

• The output layerO has |Ω| units, one for each
word of the vocabulary.

This n-gram NN LM predicts the posterior
probability of each word of the vocabulary given
the n − 1 previous words. A single forward pass
of the MLP gives p(ω|si−n+1 . . . si−1) for every
word ω ∈ Ω.

Figure 1: Architecture of the continuous space
NN LM during training. The input words are
si−n+1, . . . , si−1 (in this example, the input words
are si−3, si−2, and si−1 for a 4-gram). I , P , H ,
andO are the input, projection, hidden, and output
layer, respectively, of the MLP.

The major advantage of the connectionist ap-
proach is the automatic smoothing performed by
the neural network estimators. This smoothing is
done via a continuous space representation of the
input words. Learning the probability of n-grams,
together with their representation in a continous
space (Bengio et al., 2003), is an appropriate ap-
proximation for large vocabulary tasks. However,
one of the drawbacks of such approach is the high
computational cost entailed whenever the NN LM
is computed directly, with no simplification what-
soever. For this reason, in this paper we will be
restricting vocabulary size.

3 Experiments

3.1 Baseline system

For building the baseline SMT system, we used
the open-source SMT toolkit Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007), in its standard setup. The decoder in-
cludes a log-linear model comprising a phrase-
based translation model, a language model, a lex-
icalised distortion model and word and phrase
penalties. The weights of the log-linear interpo-
lation were optimised by means of MERT (Och,
2003).

For the baseline LM, we computed a regular
n-gram LM with Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser

208



and Ney, 1995) and interpolation by means of the
SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) toolkit. Specifically, we
trained a 6-gram LM on the larger Spanish corpora
available (i.e. UN, News-Shuffled and Europarl),
and a 5-gram LM on the News-Commentary cor-
pus. Once these LMs had been built, they were
finally interpolated so as to maximise the perplex-
ity of the News-Commentary test set of the 2008
shared task. This was done so according to pre-
liminary investigation.

3.2 NN LM system architecture

The presented systems follow previous works
of (Schwenk et al., 2006; Khalilov et al., 2008;
Schwenk and Koehn, 2008; Schwenk, 2010)
where the use of a NN LM helps achieving better
performance in the final system.

The NN LM was incorporated to the baseline
system via log-linear combination, adding a new
feature to the output N -best list generated by the
baseline system (in this case N = 1 000). Specif-
ically, the NN LM was used to compute the log-
probability of each sentence within theN -best list.
Then, the scores of such list were extended with
our new, NN LM-based feature. This being done,
we optimised the coefficients of the log-linear in-
terpolation by means of MERT, taking into ac-
count the newly introduced feature. Finally the
list was re-scored and the best hypothesis was
extracted and returned as final output. Figure 2
shows a diagram of the system structure.

3.3 Experimental setup and results

NN LM was trained with the concatenation of the
News-shuffled and News-Commentary10 Span-
ish corpora. Other language resources were dis-
carded due to the large amount of computational
resources that would have been needed for train-
ing a NN LM with such material. Table 1 shows
some statistics of the corpora. In order to reduce
the complexity of the model, the vocabulary was
restricted to the 20K more frequent words in the
concatenation of news corpora. Using this re-
stricted vocabulary implies that 6.4% of the run-
ning words of the news-test2008 set, and 7.3% of
the running words within the official 2010 test set,
will be considered as unknown for our system. In
addition, the vocabulary includes a special token
for unknown words used for compute probabili-
ties when an unknown word appears, as described
in Equation 2.

Table 1: Spanish corpora statistics. NC stands for
News-Commentary and UN for United Nations,
while |Ω| stands for vocabulary size, and M/K for
millions/thousands of elements.

Set # Lines # Words |Ω|
NC 108K 2.96M 67K
News-Shuffled 3.86M 107M 512K
Europarl 1.82M 51M 172K
UN 6.22M 214M 411K
Total 3.96M 110M 521K

A 6-gram NN LM was trained for this task,
based in previous works (Khalilov et al., 2008).
The distributed encoding input layer consists of
640 units (128 for each word), the hidden layer
has 500 units, and the output layer has 20K units,
one for each word in the restricted vocabulary.
The total number of weights in the network was
10 342 003. The training procedure was conducted
by means of the stochastic back-propagation al-
gorithm with weight decay, with a replacement of
300K training samples and 200K validation sam-
ples in each training epoch. The training and vali-
dation sets were randomly extracted from the con-
catenation of news corpora. The training set con-
sisted of 102M words (3M sentences) and valida-
tion set 8M words (300K sentences). The network
needed 129 epochs for achieving convergence, re-
sulting in 38.7M and 25.8M training and valida-
tion samples respectively. For training the NN LM
we used the April toolkit (España-Boquera et al.,
2007; Zamora-Martı́nez et al., 2009), which im-
plements a pattern recognition and neural net-
works toolkit. The perplexity achieved by the 6-
gram NN LM in the Spanish news-test08 devel-
opment set was 116, versus 94 obtained with a
standard 6-gram language model with interpola-
tion and Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney,
1995).

The number of sentences in the N -best list was
set to 1 000 unique output sentences. Results can
be seen in Table 2. In order to assess the reliability
of such results, we computed pairwise improve-
ment intervals as described in (Koehn, 2004), by
means of bootstrapping with 1000 bootstrap itera-
tions and at a 95% confidence level. Such confi-
dence test reported the improvements to be statis-
tically significant.

Four more experiments have done in order to
study the influence of the N -best list size in the

performance achieved by the NN LM rescoring.
For each N -best list size (200, 400, 600 and 800)
the weights of the log-linear interpolation were op-
timised by means of MERT over the test08 set. Ta-
ble 3 shows the test results for eachN -best list size
using the correspondent optimised weights. As it
can be seen, the size of the N -best list seems to
have an impact on the final translation quality pro-
duced. Although in this case the results are not
statistically significant for each size step, the final
difference (from 27.5 to 27.8) is already signifi-
cant.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, an improved SMT system by using a
NN LM was presented. Specifically, it has been
shown that the final translation quality, as mea-

sured by BLEU and TER, is improved over the
quality obtained with a state-of-the-art SMT sys-
tem. Such improvements, of 1.1 BLEU points,
were found to be statistically significant. The sys-
tem presented uses a neural network only for com-
puting the language model probabilities. As an
immediate future work, we intend to compute the
language model by means of a linear interpola-
tion of several neural networks. Another interest-
ing idea is to integrate the NN LM within the de-
coder itself, instead of performing a subsequent re-
scoring step. This can be done extending the ideas
presented in a previous work (Zamora-Martı́nez et
al., 2009), in which the evaluation of NN LM is
significantly sped-up.
