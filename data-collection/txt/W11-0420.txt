Abstract

We describe an experiment on a temporal or-
dering task in this paper. We show that by se-
lecting event pairs based on discourse struc-
ture and by modifying the pre-existent tem-
poral classification scheme to fit the data bet-
ter, we significantly improve inter-annotator
agreement, as well as broaden the coverage of
the task. We also present analysis of the cur-
rent temporal classification scheme and pro-
pose ways to improve it in future work.

1 Introduction

Event-based temporal inference is a fundamental
natural language technology aimed at determining
the temporal anchoring and relative temporal or-
dering between events in text. It supports a wide
range of natural language applications such as In-
formation Extraction (Ji, 2010), Question Answer-
ing (Harabagiu and Bejan, 2005; Harabagiu and
Bejan, 2006) and Text Summarization (Lin and
Hovy, 2001; Barzilay et al., 2002). Creating con-
sistently annotated domain-independent data suffi-
cient to train automatic systems has been the bot-
tleneck. While low-level temporal annotation tasks
such as identifying events and time expressions are
relatively straightforward and can be done with high
consistency, high-level tasks necessary to eventually
arrange events in a document in a temporal order
have proved to be much more challenging.

Among these high-level tasks, the task of annotat-
ing the temporal relation between main events stands
out as probably the most challenging. This task was

the only task in the TempEval campaigns (Verha-
gen et al., 2009; Verhagen et al., 2010) to deal with
inter-sentential temporal relations, and also the only
one to directly tackle event ordering. The idea is
that events covered in an article are scattered in dif-
ferent sentences, with some, presumably important
ones, expressed as predicates in prominent positions
of a sentence (i.e. the “main event” of the sentence).
By relating main events from different sentences of
an article temporally, one could get something of a
chain of important events from the article.

This task, in both previously reported attempts,
one for English (Verhagen et al., 2009) and the other
for Chinese (Xue and Zhou, 2010), has the lowest
inter-annotator agreement (at 65%) among all tasks
focusing on annotating temporal relations. Verha-
gen et al. (2009) attribute the difficulty, shared by all
tasks annotating temporal relations, mainly to two
factors: rampant temporal vagueness in natural lan-
guage and the fact that annotators are not allowed to
skip hard-to-classify cases.

Xue and Zhou (2010) take a closer look at this
task specifically. They report that part of the diffi-
culty comes from “wrong” main events (in the sense
that they are not main events in the intended sense)
being selected in the preparation step. This step is a
separate task upstream of the temporal relation task.
The “wrong” main events produced in this step be-
come part of event pairs whose temporal relation it
makes no sense to annotate, and often is hard-to-
classify. The reason “wrong” main events get se-
lected is because the selection is based on syntactic
criteria. In fact, these syntactic criteria produce re-
sults so counter-intuitive that this seemingly simple

161



preparation task only achieves 74% inter-annotator
agreement.

Another part of the difficulty comes from me-
chanical pairing of main events for temporal relation
annotation. Simply pairing up main events from ad-
jacent sentences oversimplifies the structure within
an article and is prone to produce hard-to-classify
cases for temporal relation annotation. Both causes
point to the need for a deeper level of text analysis to
inform temporal annotation. For this, Xue and Zhou
(2010) suggest introduction of discourse structure as
annotated in the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)
into temporal relation annotation.

So the previous two reports, taken together, seem
to suggest that the reason this task is especially chal-
lenging is because the difficulty associated with tem-
poral vagueness in natural language, which is shared
by all tasks dealing with temporal relation, is com-
pounded by the problem of having to annotate far-
fetched pairs that should not be annotated, which is
unique for the only task dealing with inter-sentential
temporal relations. These two problems are the foci
of our experiment done on Chinese data.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
we describe the annotation scheme; in Section 3, we
describe the annotation procedure; in Section 4 we
report and discuss the experiment results. And fi-
nally we conclude the paper.

2 Annotation Scheme

As stated in the introduction, there are two prob-
lems to be addressed in our experiment. The first
problem is that “wrong” main events get identified
and main events that do not bear any relation are
paired up for temporal annotation. To address this
problem, we follow the suggestion by Xue and Zhou
(2010), namely using a PDTB-style discourse struc-
ture to pick out and pair up main events. We be-
lieve that adopting a discourse-constrained approach
to temporal annotation will not only improve anno-
tation consistency but also increase the Informative-
ness Value of the annotated data, under the assump-
tion that temporal relations that accord with the dis-
course structure are more valuable in conveying the
overall information of a document. Since there is no
Chinese data annotated with PDTB-style discourse
structure available, we have to develop our own. The

scheme for this step is described in Section 2.1.
The second problem is that there is too much tem-

poral vagueness in natural language with respect to
the temporal classification scheme. Since we can-
not change the way natural language works, we try
to model the classification scheme after the data it is
supposed to classify. The scheme for the temporal
annotation is covered in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

2.1 Discourse-constrained selection of main
events and their pairs

2.1.1 Discourse annotation scheme
The PDTB adopts a lexically grounded approach

to discourse relation annotation (Prasad et al., 2008).
Based on discourse connectives like “since”, “and”,
and “however”, discourse relation is treated as a
predicate taking two abstract objects (AO’s) (such
as events, states, and propositions) as arguments.
For example, in the sentence below, “since” is the
lexical anchor of the relation between Arg1 and
Arg2 (example from Prasad et al. (2007)).

(1) Since [Arg2 McDonald’s menu prices rose
this year], [Arg1 the actual decline may have
been more].

This notion is generalized to cover discourse rela-
tions that do not have a lexical anchor, i.e. im-
plicit discourse relations. For example, in the two-
sentence sequence below, although no discourse
connective is present, a discourse relation similar to
the one in (1) is present between Arg1 and Arg2 (ex-
ample from Prasad et al. (2007)).

(2) [Arg1 Some have raised their cash positions to
record levels]. [Arg2 High cash positions help
buffer a fund when the market falls].

Based on this insight, we have fashioned a scheme
tailored to linguistic characteristics of Chinese text.
The linguistic characteristics of Chinese text rele-
vant to discussion here can be illustrated with the
following sentence.

slight increase from before the pilot]. [AO3
Companies respondede3 well], [AO4 generally

One feature is that it is customary to have complex
ideas packed into one sentence in Chinese. The sen-
tence above reports on how a pilot program worked
in Dongguan City. Because all that is said is about
the pilot program, it is perfectly natural to include
it all in a single sentence in Chinese. Intuitively
though, there are two different aspects of how the
pilot program worked: the number of records and
the response from the affected companies. To report
the same facts in English, it is probably more natural
to break them down into two sentences, but in Chi-
nese, not only are they merely separated by comma,
but also there is no connective relating them.

Another feature is that grammatical relation be-
tween comma-separated chunks within a sentence
is not always clear. In the above sentence, for in-
stance, although the grammatical relations between
AO1 and AO2, and between AO3 and AO4 are clear
in the English translation (i.e. the first in each pair is
the main clause and the second an adjunct), it is not
at all clear in the original. This is the result of sev-
eral characteristics of Chinese, for example, there is
no inflectional clues on the verb to indicate its gram-
matical function in the sentence.

Based on these features of Chinese text1, we have
decided to use punctuation as the main potential
indicator for discourse relations: the annotator is
asked to judge, at every instance of comma, pe-
riod, colon and semi-colon, if it is an indicator for
discourse relation; if both chunks separated by the
punctuation are projections of a predicate, then there
is a discourse relation between them. Applying this
scheme to the sentence in (3), we have four abstract
objects as marked up in the example.

1A more detailed justification for this scheme is presented in
Zhou and Xue (2011).

To determine the exact text span of each argu-
ment of a relation, we adopt the Minimality Princi-
ple formulated in Prasad et al. (2007): only as many
clauses and/or sentences should be included in an ar-
gument selection as are minimally required and suf-
ficient for the interpretation of the relation. Apply-
ing this principle to the sentence in (3), we can de-
limit the three sets of discourse relations as follows:
AO1–AO2, (AO1,AO2)–(AO3,AO4), and AO3–AO4.

2.1.2 Selection and pairing-up of main events
Selection of main events is done on the level of the

simplex abstract object, with one main event per sim-
plex AO. The main event corresponds to the predi-
cate heading the simplex AO. In (3), there are four
simplex AO’s, AO1-4 ( which further form two com-
plex AO’s, (AO1,AO2) and (AO3,AO4)). The an-
chors for the four main events are the underlined
verbs labeled as “e1-4”.

Pairing up the main events is done on the level
of discourse relation. In the case of a relation
only involving simplex AO’s, the main events of
the two AO’s pair up; in the case of a relation
involving complex AO’s, the discourse relation is
distributed among the simplex AO’s to form main
event pairs. For example, with the discourse relation
(AO1,AO2)–(AO3,AO4), four pairs of main events
are formed: e1–e3, e1–e4, e2–e3, and e2–e4. This
gets tedious fast as the number of simplex AO’s in
a complex AO increases; in this experiment, the an-
notator relies on her discretion in such cases. This
problem should be addressed in a more elegant way
in the future.

It is worth noting that in addition to picking out
right main events and event pairs for temporal anno-
tation, this scheme also broadens the coverage of the
task. In the old scheme based on syntactic criteria,
there is a stipulation: one main event per sentence.
Because the new discourse-constrained scheme is
tailored to the characteristics of Chinese text, it is
able to expose more main events (in the intended
sense) to temporal annotation.

2.2 Classification scheme for temporal relation
annotation

By modifying the six-value scheme used in Tem-
pEval (containing before, overlap, after, before-or-
overlap, overlap-or-after and vague), our classifica-

163



tion scheme has seven values in it: before, overlap,
after, not-before, not-after, groupie, and irrelevant.

2.2.1 The values “not-before” and “not-after”

The values “not-before” and “not-after” are
equivalent to “overlap-or-after” and “before-or-
overlap” in the TempEval scheme. The reason we
made this seemingly vacuous change is because we
found that the old values were used for two different
purposes by annotators. In addition to their intended
use, i.e. to capture indeterminacy between the two
simplex values, they were also used to label a spe-
cific case of “overlap”. An example of such misuse
of the value ”before-or-overlap” is presented below:

“The first local ethnic Chinese judge [e1 assumed]
the office in 1996; up until now, there have been
close to 20 ethnic Chinese locals [e2 holding] the
posts of judicial officials.”

The reason for such use is probably because it repre-
sents two alternative ways of looking at the temporal
relation between the two events : either e1 is before
the later bulk of e2 or e1 overlaps the beginning tip
of e2. To avoid such mis-uses, we made the above
change.

2.2.2 The value “groupie”

This value is set up for two events whose tempo-
ral relation to each other is unclear, but are known to
happen within the same temporal range. For exam-
ple, the temporal relation between the events repre-
sented by the underlined verbs should be classified
as “groupie”.

“Yesterday and today, CPPCC members from Hong
Kong SAR also [e1 visited] Ningbo Development
District and Ningbo Xitianxin Textile Ltd., and [e2
toured] Tianyi Pavilion and the ancestral home of
Chiang Kai-shek.”

In this example, the common range shared by the
two events is expressed in the form of a time ex-
pression, “今昨两天” (“yesterday and today”), but
it does not have to be the case. It can be in the form
of another event (e.g., “工程建设过程中” (“during
the process of project construction”)), or another en-
tity with a time stamp (e.g., “八五期间” (“in the
Eighth Five-year Plan period”)).

It should be noted that the linguistic phenomenon
captured by this value can occur in a situation where
the internal temporal relation between two events
can be classified with another value. So ideally, this
value should be set up as a feature parallel to the
existent classification scheme. But due to technical
restrictions imposed on our experiment, we grouped
it with all the others and instructed the annotators
to use it only when none of the five more specific
values applies.

2.2.3 The value “irrelevant”
We substituted this value for the old one “vague”

because it is too vague. Anything that cannot fit into
the classification scheme would be labeled “vague”,
but in fact, some cases are temporally relevant and
probably should be characterized in the classifica-
tion scheme. Case in point are those we now label
“groupie”.

This change reflects our guiding principle for de-
signing the classification scheme. If the relation be-
tween two events is temporally relevant, we should
try to characterize it in some way; if too many rela-
tions are temporally relevant but too vague to fit into
the classification scheme (comfortably), then the ad-
equacy of the scheme is questionable.

2.3 An additional specification: which event?
In addition to the classification scheme, it is also
necessary to specify which event should be con-
sidered for temporal annotation. This question has

164



never been clearly addressed, probably because it
seems self-evident: the event in question is the one
expressed by the event anchor (usually a verb). This
intuitive answer actually accounts for some too-
vague-to-classify cases. In some cases, the event
that is easily annotated (and should be the one being
annotated in our opinion) is not the event expressed
by the verb, as is the case in (6).

“With regard to attracting foreign business invest-
ments, China has now become the developing coun-
try that utilizes the most foreign funds in the world.”

This sentence is taken from an article summarizing
China’s economic progress during the “Eighth Five-
Year Plan” period (from 1991 to 1995). The an-
chor for the main event of the sentence is clearly
“成为” (“become”), but should the event it repre-
sents, the process of China becoming the develop-
ing country that utilizes the most foreign funds, be
considered for the temporal relation annotation? It
is both counter-intuitive and impractical.

Intuitively, the sentence is a statement of the cur-
rent state with regard to attracting foreign business
investments, not of the process leading up to that
state. If we were to consider the process of “be-
coming” in relation to other events temporally, we
would have to ask, when are the starting and ending
points of this process? How does one decide when it
is not made clear in the article? One could conceiv-
ably go as far back as to when China did not use one
cent of foreign funds. Should it be restricted to the
“Eighth Five-Year Plan” period since it is the target
period of the whole article? But why use the five-
year period, when there are more specific, syntac-
tically explicit aspectual/temporal modifiers in the
sentence, i.e. “现已” (“now already”), to restrict it?
To make use of these in-sentence aspectual/temporal
modifiers, we have to go with our intuition that the
event is the current state of China with regard to uti-
lizing foreign investments, i.e. the temporal location
of the event is at present.

So the event that should be considered for tem-
poral annotation is not the one represented by the
event anchor itself, but rather the one described by
the whole clause/sentence headed by the event an-
chor. This allows all sorts of temporal clues in the
same clause/sentence to help decide the temporal lo-
cation of the event, hence makes the annotation task
easier in many cases.

3 Annotation procedure

The annotation process consists of two separate
stages, with a different annotation procedure in place
for each. The first stage involves only one annotator,
and it deals with picking out pairs of event anchors
based on the discourse relation as described in Sec-
tion 2.1. The output of this stage defines the targets
for the next stage of annotation: temporal relation
annotation. Temporal relation annotation is a two-
phase process, including double-blind annotation by
two annotators and then adjudication by a judge.

With this procedure in place, the results we re-
port in Section 4 are all from the second stage. Two
annotators go through ten weeks of training, which
includes annotating 10 files each week, submitting
them to adjudication, and then attending a training
session at the end of each week. In the training ses-
sion, the judge discusses with the annotators her ad-
judication notes from the previous week, as well as
specific questions the annotators raise.

The data set consists of 100 files taken from the
Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005). The source of
these files is Xinhua newswire. The annotation is
carried out within the confines of the Brandeis An-
notation Tool (BAT)2 (Verhagen, 2010).

4 Evaluation and discussion

Table 1 reports the inter-annotator agreement of tem-
poral annotation, both between the two annotators
(A and B) and between each annotator and the judge
(J), over a training period of ten weeks. Each week,
10 files are assigned, averaging about 315 event
pairs for annotation.

Table 1 shows that annotators have taken up the
temporal annotation scheme fairly quickly, reaching
75% agreement within three weeks. After several

weeks of consolidation and fine-tuning, the agree-
ment slowly reaches the lower 80% towards the end
of the 10-week training period. This level of agree-
ment is a substantial improvement over the previ-
ously reported results, at 65%, for both English and
Chinese data (Verhagen et al., 2009; Xue and Zhou,
2010). This indicates that the general direction of
our experiment is on the right track.

Table 2 below is the confusion matrix based on
the annotation data from the final 4 weeks:

Table 2: Confusion matrix on annotation from Weeks
7-10: a=after; b=before; o=overlap; na=not-after;
nb=not-before; g=groupie; i=irrelevant.

The matrix is fairly clean except when the value
“overlap” is concerned. This value really stands out
in more than one way. It is the most nebulous one in
the whole scheme, prone to be confused with all six
other values. In particular, it is most likely to be con-
fused with the value “irrelevant”. It is also the most
used value among all seven values, covering roughly
half of the tokens. We will discuss this value in more
detail in Section 4.2 below.

The value “groupie” may also seem troublesome
if we look at mis-classification as a percentage of its
total occurrences, however, it may not be as bad as it
seems. As pointed out in Section 2.2.2, despite the
fact that the linguistic phenomenon this value cap-
tures can, and does, co-occur with temporal relations
represented by other values, we had to set it up as an
opposing value to the rest due to technical restric-
tions. If/when this value is set up as a stand-alone
feature to capture the linguistic phenomenon fully,
the percentage of mis-classification should drop sig-
nificantly because the number of total occurrences
will increase dramatically.

The overall distribution of values shown in Table
2 is very skewed. At one end of the distribution
spectrum is the value “overlap”, covering half of
the data; at the other end are the values “not-before”
and “not-after”, covering less than 0.3% of the token
combined. It raises the question if such a classifica-
tion scheme is well-designed to produce data useful
for machine learning.

To shed light on what is behind the numbers and
to uncover trends that numbers do not show, we also
take a closer look at the annotation data. Three is-
sues stand out.

4.1 Event anchor

In our current scheme, effort is made to pick out the
predicate from a clause as the event anchor for tem-
poral annotation. Our experiment suggests maybe
this step should be skipped since it, in practice, un-
dermines a specification of the scheme. The specifi-
cation is that the event to be considered for temporal
annotation is the one being described by the whole
clause, but the practice of displaying a mere word to
the annotator in effect instructs the annotator to con-
centrate on the word itself, rather than the clause.
Despite repeated reminder during training sessions,
the suggestive power of the display still sometimes
gets the upper hand. (7) presents such an example
concerning e1 and e2.

“During this period, West African Peacekeeping
Force [e1 dispatched] fighter jets and bombed rebel
positions, [e2 killing] about 50 rebel troops.”

One annotator classified the relation as “before”, ob-
viously thinking of the event of dispatching fighter
jets as e1; had he considered the event of dispatch-
ing fighter jets and bombing the rebel positions, the
event being described by the clause, the value would
have easily been “overlap”.

Since displaying the single-word event anchor
sometimes leads annotators astray, this step proba-
bly should be skipped. Doing so also simplifies the
annotation process.

4.2 The value “overlap”

As pointed out above, the value “overlap” is quite
a troubling character in the classification scheme: it
is both the most-used and probably the least well-
defined. Annotation data show that when it is con-
fused with “after”, “before”, “not-after”, and “not-
before”, it usually involves a perceptually punc-
tual event (“pp-event” henceforth) and a perceptu-
ally lasting event (“pl-event” henceforth), and the is-
sue is whether the pp-event coincides with one of the
temporal edges of the pl-event. If it does, then the
value is “overlap”; otherwise, it is “after”/“before”.
And on top of it is the factor of how sure one is
of the issue: if one is sure, either way, the value
is “overlap”/“after”/“before”; otherwise, it is “not-
after”/“not-before”. Below is an example on which
the two annotators disagree as to whether the rela-
tion between e1 and e2 should be classified as “be-
fore” or “overlap”.

“In addition, in the South America Cup, Brazil-

In this example, e2 is the pp-event and e1 is the pl-
event. Depending on when one thinks e2 happened,
either as soon as the last match ended or at the later
medal ceremony, (and if the former, whether there is
temporal overlap between e1 and e2), it is classified
as either “before” or “overlap; and if one is unsure,
it can be classified as “not-after”.

Such cases again raise the same question as the
drastically uneven distribution of values shown in
Table 2: Does the current classification scheme slice
the temporal pie the right way? Let us make a poster
child out of “overlap”: it seems to both impose too
stringent a condition and not make enough distinc-
tion. It imposes too stringent a condition on those
cases like (8) to which whether there is temporal
overlap seems beside the point. At the same time,
it does not make enough distinction for cases like
(4), in which an event does share one edge of an-
other event temporally: once such cases are classi-
fied as “overlap”, the specific information regard-
ing the edge is lost. Such information could be very
useful in temporal inference. Since it is infeasible
to annotate the temporal relation between all events
in an article, temporal inference is needed to expand
the scope of temporal annotation. For example, if it
is known from annotation that e1 is before e2 and
e2 is before e3, then it can be inferred e1 is before
e3. In the case of “overlap”, whenever it is one of
the premises, no inference can be made, but if the
“edge” information is supplied, some inferences are
possible.

To make finer-grained distinctions in the classifi-
cation scheme runs counter to the conventional wis-
dom that a coarser-grained scheme would do a bet-
ter job handling vagueness. But our experiment has
proven the conventional wisdom wrong: our seven-
value system achieved much higher agreement than
the old six-value system. So the key is not fewer, but
better, distinctions, “better” in the sense that they
characterize the data in a more intuitive and insight-
ful way. Temporal relation in natural language is
“too” vague only when we judge it against a sys-
tem of temporal logic, in fact, we think the right
word to describe temporal relation in natural lan-
guage is “flexible”: it is as precise as the situation
calls for. To characterize the flexibility better, for
starters, “overlap” needs to be restructured for rea-
sons put forth above, and “not-before” and “not-

167



after” should be discarded since they obviously do
not carry weight.

4.3 Objective vs. subjective temporal reference

A major contributor to uncertainty and disagreement
in annotation is subjective temporal reference. Sub-
jective temporal reference is made based on the au-
thor’s perspective of the temporal axis, for example,
“今天” (“today”), “目前” (“at present), and “过去”
(”past”). In this group, references with a fixed span
do not constitute a problem once the point of utter-
ance is determined (e.g. literal use of “today”, “this
month”); it is those with an elastic temporal span that
cause disagreement. For example, “at present” can
have a span of a second, or several minutes, or a cou-
ple of hours, or even years depending on the context.
When an event modified with this type of tempo-
ral expression is paired with another event modified
with direct reference to a point/span on the tempo-
ral axis (i.e. with an objective reference), annotation
becomes tricky. The event pair e1-e2 in the two-
sentence sequence below is such an example.

“In the past, building a bridge on Yangtze River was
a national affair, nowadays it almost [e1becomes]
a common scene. In 1992, farmers in Yangzhong
County, Jiangsu Province [e2raised] funds and com-
pleted Yangzhong Yangtze Bridge, while Chibi
Yangtze Bridge in Hubei Province cost more than
300 million Yuan, all from private fund-raising.”

This is taken from a piece written in 1997. In the
context, it is clear that the contrast is between the
situation before the opening-up of China and the sit-

uation about 20 years later. So it is reasonable to as-
sume that the year 1992 falls inside the span of what
the author considered nowadays; at the same time, it
seems also reasonable to assume a narrow interpre-
tation of “现今” (“nowadays”) that does not include
the year 1992 in the span. These two interpretations
would result in “overlap” and “after” respectively,
and actually did so in our experiment.

There are also extreme cases in which objective
and subjective temporal references come in direct
conflict. For example,

“When a reporter [e1 asked] about the status of
China-Russia relationship and the prospects for co-
operation, President Jiang Zemin [e2 said], ...”

The relation between e1 and e2 is before based
on objective reference, but overlap according to
the subjective reference, indicated by “当..时”
(“when”). This problem should be factored in when
a new classification scheme is designed.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have described an experiment that
focuses on two aspects of the task of annotating
temporal relation of main events: annotation tar-
get selection and a better-fitting temporal classifica-
tion scheme. Experiment results show that selecting
main event pairs based on discourse structure and
modeling the classification scheme after the data im-
proves inter-annotator agreement dramatically. Re-
sults also show weakness of the current temporal
classification scheme. For that, we propose a re-
structuring along the lines of what this experiment
has proven working: making more intuitive and in-
sightful distinctions that characterize the data bet-
ter. This direction can be taken to improve other
high-level temporal annotation tasks that have been
plagued by the same “vagueness” problem.
