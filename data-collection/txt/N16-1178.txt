Abstract

We introduce a novel, simple convolution neu-
ral network (CNN) architecture – multi-group
norm constraint CNN (MGNC-CNN) – that
capitalizes on multiple sets of word embed-
dings for sentence classification. MGNC-
CNN extracts features from input embedding
sets independently and then joins these at the
penultimate layer in the network to form a fi-
nal feature vector. We then adopt a group
regularization strategy that differentially pe-
nalizes weights associated with the subcom-
ponents generated from the respective embed-
ding sets. This model is much simpler than
comparable alternative architectures and re-
quires substantially less training time. Fur-
thermore, it is flexible in that it does not re-
quire input word embeddings to be of the same
dimensionality. We show that MGNC-CNN
consistently outperforms baseline models.

1 Introduction

Neural models have recently gained popularity for
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (Gold-
berg, 2015; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Cho,
2015). For sentence classification, in particular,
Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have realized
impressive performance (Kim, 2014; Zhang and
Wallace, 2015). These models operate over word
embeddings, i.e., dense, low dimensional vector rep-
resentations of words that aim to capture salient se-
mantic and syntactic properties (Collobert and We-
ston, 2008).

An important consideration for such models is the

specification of the word embeddings. Several op-
tions exist. For example, Kalchbrenner et al. (2014)
initialize word vectors to random low-dimensional
vectors to be fit during training, while Johnson
and Zhang (2014) use fixed, one-hot encodings for
each word. By contrast, Kim (2014) initializes
word vectors to those estimated via the word2vec
model trained on 100 billion words of Google
News (Mikolov et al., 2013); these are then up-
dated during training. Initializing embeddings to
pre-trained word vectors is intuitively appealing be-
cause it allows transfer of learned distributional se-
mantics. This has allowed a relatively simple CNN
architecture to achieve remarkably strong results.

Many pre-trained word embeddings are now read-
ily available on the web, induced using different
models, corpora, and processing steps. Different
embeddings may encode different aspects of lan-
guage (Padó and Lapata, 2007; Erk and Padó, 2008;
Levy and Goldberg, 2014): those based on bag-of-
words (BoW) statistics tend to capture associations
(doctor and hospital), while embeddings based on
dependency-parses encode similarity in terms of use
(doctor and surgeon). It is natural to consider how
these embeddings might be combined to improve
NLP models in general and CNNs in particular.

Contributions. We propose MGNC-CNN, a novel,
simple, scalable CNN architecture that can accom-
modate multiple off-the-shelf embeddings of vari-
able sizes. Our model treats different word em-
beddings as distinct groups, and applies CNNs in-
dependently to each, thus generating corresponding
feature vectors (one per embedding) which are then

1522



concatenated at the classification layer. Inspired by
prior work exploiting regularization to encode struc-
ture for NLP tasks (Yogatama and Smith, 2014; Wal-
lace et al., 2015), we impose different regularization
penalties on weights for features generated from the
respective word embedding sets.

Our approach enjoys the following advantages com-
pared to the only existing comparable model (Yin
and Schütze, 2015): (i) It can leverage diverse, read-
ily available word embeddings with different dimen-
sions, thus providing flexibility. (ii) It is compar-
atively simple, and does not, for example, require
mutual learning or pre-training. (iii) It is an order of
magnitude more efficient in terms of training time.

2 Related Work

Prior work has considered combining latent repre-
sentations of words that capture syntactic and se-
mantic properties (Van de Cruys et al., 2011), and in-
ducing multi-modal embeddings (Bruni et al., 2012)
for general NLP tasks. And recently, Luo et al.
(2014) proposed a framework that combines mul-
tiple word embeddings to measure text similarity,
however their focus was not on classification.

More similar to our work, Yin and Schütze (2015)
proposed MVCNN for sentence classification. This
CNN-based architecture accepts multiple word em-
beddings as inputs. These are then treated as sepa-
rate ‘channels’, analogous to RGB channels in im-
ages. Filters consider all channels simultaneously.
MVCNN achieved state-of-the-art performance on
multiple sentence classification tasks. However, this
model has practical drawbacks. (i) MVCNN re-
quires that input word embeddings have the same
dimensionality. Thus to incorporate a second set of
word vectors trained on a corpus (or using a model)
of interest, one needs to either find embeddings that
happen to have a set number of dimensions or to es-
timate embeddings from scratch. (ii) The model is
complex, both in terms of implementation and run-
time. Indeed, this model requires pre-training and
mutual-learning and requires days of training time,
whereas the simple architecture we propose requires
on the order of an hour (and is easy to implement).

3 Model Description

We first review standard one-layer CNN (which ex-
ploits a single set of embeddings) for sentence clas-
sification (Kim, 2014), and then propose our aug-
mentations, which exploit multiple embedding sets.

Basic CNN. In this model we first replace each word
in a sentence with its vector representation, result-
ing in a sentence matrix A ∈ Rs×d, where s is the
(zero-padded) sentence length, and d is the dimen-
sionality of the embeddings. We apply a convolu-
tion operation between linear filters with parameters
w1,w2, ...,wk and the sentence matrix. For each
wi ∈ Rh×d, where h denotes ‘height’, we slide fil-
ter i across A, considering ‘local regions’ of h ad-
jacent rows at a time. At each local region, we per-
form element-wise multiplication and then take the
element-wise sum between the filter and the (flat-
tened) sub-matrix of A, producing a scalar. We do
this for each sub-region of A that the filter spans, re-
sulting in a feature map vector ci ∈ R(s−h+1)×1. We
can use multiple filter sizes with different heights,
and for each filter size we can have multiple fil-
ters. Thus the model comprises k weight vectors
w1,w2, ...wk, each of which is associated with an
instantiation of a specific filter size. These in turn
generate corresponding feature maps c1, c2, ...ck,
with dimensions varying with filter size. A 1-max
pooling operation is applied to each feature map,
extracting the largest number oi from each feature
map i. Finally, we combine all oi together to form a
feature vector o ∈ Rk to be fed through a softmax
function for classification. We regularize weights at
this level in two ways. (1) Dropout, in which we
randomly set elements in o to zero during the train-
ing phase with probability p, and multiply p with the
parameters trained in o at test time. (2) An l2 norm
penalty, for which we set a threshold λ for the l2
norm of o during training; if this is exceeded, we
rescale the vector accordingly. For more details, see
(Zhang and Wallace, 2015).

MG-CNN. Assuming we have m word embeddings
with corresponding dimensions d1, d2, ...dm, we can
simply treat each word embedding independently.
In this case, the input to the CNN comprises mul-
tiple sentence matrices A1,A2, ...Am, where each
Al ∈ Rs×dl may have its own width dl. We then ap-

1523



ply different groups of filters {w1}, {w2}, ...{wm}
independently to each Al, where {wl} denotes the
set of filters for Al. As in basic CNN, {wl} may
have multiple filter sizes, and multiple filters of each
size may be introduced. At the classification layer
we then obtain a feature vector ol for each embed-
ding set, and we can simply concatenate these to-
gether to form the final feature vector o to feed into
the softmax function, where o = o1 ⊕ o2... ⊕ om.
This representation contains feature vectors gener-
ated from all sets of embeddings under considera-
tion. We call this method multiple group CNN (MG-
CNN). Here groups refer to the features generated
from different embeddings. Note that this differs
from ‘multi-channel’ models because at the convo-
lution layer we use different filters on each word em-
bedding matrix independently, whereas in a standard
multi-channel approach each filter would consider
all channels simultaneously and generate a scalar
from all channels at each local region. As above, we
impose a max l2 norm constraint on the final feature
vector o for regularization. Figure 1 illustrates this
approach.

MGNC-CNN. We propose an augmentation of MG-
CNN, Multi-Group Norm Constraint CNN (MGNC-
CNN), which differs in its regularization strategy.
Specifically, in this variant we impose grouped reg-
ularization constraints, independently regularizing
subcomponents ol derived from the respective em-
beddings, i.e., we impose separate max norm con-
straints λl for each ol (where l again indexes em-
bedding sets); these λl hyper-parameters are to be
tuned on a validation set. Intuitively, this method
aims to better capitalize on features derived from
word embeddings that capture discriminative prop-
erties of text for the task at hand by penalizing larger
weight estimates for features derived from less dis-
criminative embeddings.

move phrases of length less than 4 from the training
set.1 Subj (Pang and Lee, 2004). The aim here is to
classify sentences as either subjective or objective.
This comprises 5000 instances of each. TREC (Li
and Roth, 2002). A question classification dataset

training and 500 test instances. Irony (Wallace et
al., 2014). This dataset contains 16,006 sentences
from reddit labeled as ironic (or not). The dataset
is imbalanced (relatively few sentences are ironic).
Thus before training, we under-sampled negative in-
stances to make classes sizes equal. Note that for
this dataset we report the Area Under Curve (AUC),
rather than accuracy, because it is imbalanced.

4.2 Pre-trained Word Embeddings

We consider three sets of word embeddings for our
experiments: (i) word2vec2 is trained on 100 billion
tokens of Google News dataset; (ii) GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014)3 is trained on aggregated global
word-word co-occurrence statistics from Common
Crawl (840B tokens); and (iii) syntactic word
embedding trained on dependency-parsed corpora.
These three embedding sets happen to all be 300-
dimensional, but our model could accommodate ar-
bitrary and variable sizes.

We pre-trained our own syntactic embeddings fol-
lowing (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). We parsed
the ukWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2009) using the
Stanford Dependency Parser v3.5.2 with Stanford
Dependencies (Chen and Manning, 2014) and ex-
tracted (word, relation+context) pairs from parse
trees. We “collapsed” nodes with prepositions
and notated inverse relations separately, e.g., “dog

2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
3http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

barks” emits two tuples: (barks, nsubj dog) and
(dog, nsubj−1 barks). We filter words and contexts
that appear fewer than 100 times, resulting in∼173k
words and 1M contexts. We trained 300d vectors us-
ing word2vecf4 with default parameters.

4.3 Setup

We compared our proposed approaches to a stan-
dard CNN that exploits a single set of word em-
beddings (Kim, 2014). We also compared to a
baseline of simply concatenating embeddings for
each word to form long vector inputs. We re-
fer to this as Concatenation-CNN C-CNN. For
all multiple embedding approaches (C-CNN, MG-
CNN and MGNC-CNN), we explored two com-
bined sets of embedding: word2vec+Glove, and
word2vec+syntactic, and one three sets of embed-
ding: word2vec+Glove+syntactic. For all models,
we tuned the l2 norm constraint λ over the range
{13 , 1, 3, 9, 81, 243} on a validation set. For instan-

tiations of MGNC-CNN in which we exploited two
embeddings, we tuned both λ1, and λ2; where we
used three embedding sets, we tuned λ1, λ2 and λ3.

We used standard train/test splits for those datasets
that had them. Otherwise, we performed 10-fold
cross validation, creating nested development sets
with which to tune hyperparameters. For all exper-
iments we used filters sizes of 3, 4 and 5 and we
created 100 feature maps for each filter size. We
applied 1 max-pooling and dropout (rate: 0.5) at
the classification layer. For training we used back-
propagation in mini-batches and used AdaDelta as
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) update rule,
and set mini-batch size as 50. In this work, we treat
word embeddings as part of the parameters of the
model, and update them as well during training. In
all our experiments, we only tuned the max norm
constraint(s), fixing all other hyperparameters.

4.4 Results and Discussion

We repeated each experiment 10 times and report
the mean and ranges across these. This replication
is important because training is stochastic and thus
introduces variance in performance (Zhang and Wal-
lace, 2015). Results are shown in Table 1, and the
corresponding best norm constraint value is shown
in Table 2. We also show results on Subj, SST-1 and
SST-2 achieved by the more complex model of (Yin
and Schütze, 2015) for comparison; this represents
the state-of-the-art on the three datasets other than
TREC.

We can see that MGNC-CNN and MG-CNN al-
ways outperform baseline methods (including C-
CNN), and MGNC-CNN is usually better than
MG-CNN. And on the Subj dataset, MG-CNN ac-
tually achieves slightly better results than (Yin and
Schütze, 2015), with far less complexity and re-
quired training time (MGNC-CNN performs com-
parably, although no better, here). On the TREC
dataset, the best-ever accuracy we are aware of is
96.0% (Mou et al., 2015), which falls within the
range of the result of our MGNC-CNN model with
three word embeddings. On the irony dataset, our
model with three embeddings achieves 4% improve-
ment (in terms of AUC) compared to the baseline
model.

On SST-1 and SST-2, our model performs slightly
worse than (Yin and Schütze, 2015). However, we
again note that their performance is achieved using
a much more complex model which involves pre-
training and mutual-learning steps. This model takes
days to train, whereas our model requires on the or-
der of an hour.

We note that the method proposed by Astudillo et
al. (2015) is able to accommodate multiple embed-
ding sets with different dimensions by projecting the
original word embeddings into a lower-dimensional
space. However, this work requires training the op-
timal projection matrix on laebled data first, which
again incurs large overhead.

Of course, our model also has its own limitations: in
MGNC-CNN, we need to tune the norm constraint
hyperparameter for all the word embeddings. As the
number of word embedding increases, this will in-
crease the running time. However, this tuning pro-
cedure is embarrassingly parallel.

5 Conclusions

We have proposed MGNC-CNN: a simple, flexible
CNN architecture for sentence classification that can
exploit multiple, variable sized word embeddings.
We demonstrated that this consistently achieves bet-
ter results than a baseline architecture that exploits
only a single set of word embeddings, and also
a naive concatenation approach to capitalizing on
multiple embeddings. Furthermore, our results are
comparable to those achieved with a recently pro-
posed model (Yin and Schütze, 2015) that is much
more complex. However, our simple model is easy
to implement and requires an order of magnitude
less training time. Furthermore, our model is much
more flexible than previous approaches, because it
can accommodate variable-size word embeddings.
