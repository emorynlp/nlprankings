Abstract

One characteristic feature of Celtic languages is mutation, i.e. the fact that the initial consonant
of words may change according to the context. We provide a quick description of this linguistic
phenomenon for Breton along with a formalization using finite state transducers. This approach
allows an exact and compact description of mutations. The result can be used in various contexts,
especially for spell checking and language teaching.

1 Introduction

Celtic languages (Welsh, Cornish, Irish, Scottish-Gaelic, Manx, etc.) are known to support a common
feature: the initial consonant of different types of words (esp. nouns, adjectives and verbs) is modified
in certain contexts and after certain function words (e.g. prepositions and determiners for nouns and
adjectives; auxiliaries for verbs). This phenomenon known as “mutation” has been largely studied and
described from a linguistic point of view. Formal descriptions have even been proposed, especially
Mittendorf and Sadler (2006) for Welsh.

In this paper, we investigate mutations in Breton.1 Our study is largely inspired by the previous
study by Mittendorf and Sadler for Welsh: We share with these authors the idea that “initial mutation is
close to inflection in nature and is essentially a morphosyntactic phenomenon”. We propose to process
this phenomenon with finite state transducers. In fact, we propose two formalizations: in the first one,
mutations are processed by directly storing the lexical forms with mutations in a dictionary of inflected
forms; in the second one, local rules encoded using finite state transducers are applied dynamically,
depending on the context. We show that this strategy allows for an exact and compact description of the
phenomenon, since transducers directly encode grammar rules.

The paper is organized as follows: we first propose a linguistic description of this phenomenon. We
then explore the two strategies exposed in the previous paragraph: a dictionary of inflected form vs local
grammars encoded using finite state machines. We conclude with a discussion and an overview of the
practical use of this implementation.

1.1 A Quick Description of Mutations in Breton
As said in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton mutations), “Breton is characterized by initial
consonant mutations, which are changes to the initial sound of a word caused by certain syntactic or
morphological environments. In addition Breton, like French, has a number of purely phonological
sandhi features caused when certain sounds come into contact with others.” The following details are
then added: “the mutations are divided into four main groups, according to the changes they cause:
soft mutation (in Breton: kemmadurioù dre vlotaat), hard mutation (kemmadurioù dre galetaat), spirant
mutation (kemmadurioù c’hwezhadenniñ) and mixed mutation (kemmadurioù mesket). There are also
a number of defective (or incomplete) mutations which affect only certain words or certain letters.” A

same word can thus appear differently depending on these classes of changes (for example the noun tad
– father – becomes da dad – your father; he zad – her father; etc. because of the possessive pronouns
da and he that entail different kinds of mutation).

The best approach to give an idea of mutations is to consider some examples. “Soft mutations” refer
to the fact that after the definite article ar (and its variant an) or the indefinite article ur (or un) the initial
consonant of singular feminine nouns is subject to the following changes:

• K→ G, ex. Kador (chair)→ Ur gador
• T→ D, ex. Taol (table)→ Un daol
• P→ B, ex. Paner (basket)→ Ur baner
• G→ C’H, ex. Gavr (goat)→ Ur c’havr
• GW→W, ex. Gwern (mast)→ Ur wern
Note that in Breton nouns referring to objects and abstract notions can be either masculine or feminine

(there is no neuter case).
Although the phenomenon is well known, its description is not straightforward since it involves a

large number of parameters and different types of information (lexical, morphological, semantic). For
example, plural masculine nouns referring to male persons have the same behavior as singular feminine
nouns (but this is only true for plural masculine nouns referring to people, not for all plural nouns). It is
therefore necessary to distinguish different categories of nouns.

• K→ G, ex. Kigerien (butchers)→ Ar gigerien
• T→ D, ex. Tud (people)→ An dud
• P→ B, ex. Pesketaerien (fishermen)→ Ar besketaerien
• G→ C’H, ex. Gellaoued (French)→ Ar C’hallaoued
• GW→W, ex. Gwerzherien (sellers)→ Ar werzherien

These mutations also affect adjectives, provided that the noun preceding the adjective ends with a vowel
or with the consonant l, m, n, or r.

• K→ G, ex. Kaer (nice)→ Ur gador gaer (a nice chair)
• T→ D, ex. Tev (thick)→ Ur wern dev (a thick mast)
• P→ B, ex. Paour (poor)→ Ur vamm baour (a poor mother)

There are different series of mutations depending on the functional word preceding the noun (and the
adjectives if any). It is one of the main difficulties of the language since this phenomenon changes the
initial of the words: after mutation, words cannot be found anymore directly in the dictionary.

A comprehensive description of this phenomenon can be found in traditional grammars of the lan-
guage: see especially Kervella (1976), Hemon (1984) and Stump (1984) for a formal description of
agreement in Breton.

1.2 Automatic Processing of Mutations in Breton
Two approaches are possible:

• store all the inflected lexical forms and their mutations in a dictionary. Mutation is then considered
as a case of word variation (like the alternation singular/plural);

• compute on the fly the lexical form in context, which is an interesting strategy for text generation
or, more directly, in the context of text authoring (for example to assist students producing texts in
Breton).

In this paper, we consider both approaches since they are both relevant depending on the context.

2 Two Competing / Complementary Solutions for Mutations in Breton

The following section describes two ways of processing mutations in Breton. We discuss their interest
and their applicability to the problem.

2.1 A Comprehensive Dictionary of Inflected Forms
This solution is the simplest one: all inflected forms including those with modified initial letters are
included in the dictionary. The dictionary remains manageable and ambiguity introduced by the new
lexical forms is limited. Below is a short extract of a dictionary of inflected forms including lexical
forms after mutation:

kador,kador.N:fs taol,taol.N:fs
gador,kador.N:fs daol,taol.N:fs
c’hador,kador.N:fs zaol,taol.N:fs

The format of the dictionary is the one defined by LADL (Courtois and Silberztein, 1990): inflected
forms are followed by a lemma (separated by a comma). The category of the word can then be found (N
for noun) as well as morphosyntactic features (fs: feminine singular).

However, this solution is not fully satisfactory since it does not explain why a given form is used in
a given context. It would be relevant to provide a more dynamic description of the process taking into
account the different constraints we have seen in the previous section.

2.2 A Finite State Approach
We have seen in the introduction that mutations refer to a simple change in the first letter of certain words
in certain contexts. This phenomenon is essentially local (it does not require to take into account a large
context) so finite state transducers seem to be a relevant choice. These transducers will directly encode
the rules described in the grammar of Breton that just need to be made more formal.

Below (Figure 1) is an example of such a finite state transducer.

Figure 1: Graph MUT-Detfs-K-G

This graph directly encodes all the constraints involved in the process. Elements that appear in boxes
describe a linguistic sequence while elements appearing under the boxes correspond to the rewriting part
of the transducer (i.e. the transduction). Here is a description of the different elements that can be used
for the linguistic description:

• Tags between < and > refer to morphosyntactic categories (DET for determiner, N for noun, A
for adjective, etc.);

• The elements after the colon are morphological features (f: feminine , s: singular...);
• The # sign indicates a separator between words (e.g. blank spaces between words);
• A gray box refers to a subgraph (here LettreMin refers to all lowercase letters; please note that

the sequence described here corresponds to any sequence of letters between separators, i.e. tokens,
because of the recursion on the state itself);

• Other items appearing in a box correspond to characters (or lexical forms);
Here, we see clearly that K becomes G if the sequence is a fem. sing. noun appearing immediately

after a determiner. Notations correspond to the ones defined by the LADL team, see Silberztein (1993)

and Paumier (2011) – other frameworks could of course be used like the Xerox FST toolbox (Beesley
and Karttunen, 2003).

Transducers provide a unified view of the different contraints along with a rewriting process. Recursive
transducers (RTN) make it possible to obtain a concise and effective formalization. Different linguistic
phenomena can be processed using a cascade of automata applied one after the other. For example, it
seems relevant to re-use the graph encoding noun mutations to process adjectives. If all the mutations
for nouns have been encoded and compiled in a single graph called MUT, it is then possible to write the
fllowing transducer (figure 2) for adjectives.

Figure 2: Graph MUT-Adj-K-G

MUT also encodes the constraints on the last vowel of the previous word (only adjectives following a
noun ending with a vowel or with l, m, n or r are subject to this mutation).

2.3 Implementation and evaluation

Local contextual grammars can be encoded using various techniques but finite state transducers seem
to be the most effective and readable way to encode these rules. This is in line with previous work:
for example Mittendorf and Sadler (2006) use the Xerox finite state transducer toolbox to implement
mutations in Welsh. Our proposal is very close to theirs.

Various other platforms allow the manipulation of finite state transducers for local grammars. Scripting
languages (like perl or python) also offer a good solution but these languages are made to manipulate
strings. However for mutations we need to have different information on the words themselves, hence
using a linguistic toolbox seems more appropriate.

The implementation of this linguistic phenomenon using finite state transducers produce a compact
and accurate description. Grammars are easy to modify and maintain. Additionally different grammars
could be developed to take into account local variations and dialects.

3 Discussion

We have presented a practical approach to process mutations in breton. The approach is based on well
known techniques (finite state transducers) that provide an accurate and efficient description of the phe-
nomenon. The technique used reveal the fact that mutation is essentially a morphosyntactic phenomenon,
as said in the introduction.

However, the main challenge does not lie in the proposed formalization. Endangered languages are
generally not well supported (lack of resources and automatic tools) and we think this kind of contribution
could have a positive impact on the evolution of the language. If relevant tools exist, it could be a way to
attract new attention and help language students acquire a good command of the language. Since a large
part of language learners study at home, having dynamic tools assisting text production would be a real
plus.

Adding explanation to the above rules would make it possible to generate suggestions during text
production or text revision. From this perspective, the description we provide could serve as a basis for a
spell checker of the language.2 Detailed explanations would make the whole system usable for assisting
people during language learning (e.g. to explain why a given sequence in not fully correct in case a word
should appear with a mutation, etc.). This strategy could easily be re-used for other languages and other
linguistic phenomena.

2Note that different initiatives exist to develop natural language tools for processing Breton. We should cite more specifically
the association Drouizig http://www.drouizig.org/ that has developed a spell checker independently of this study.
