Abstract
We consider the problem of using sentence
compression techniques to facilitate query-
focused multi-document summarization. We
present a sentence-compression-based frame-
work for the task, and design a series of
learning-based compression models built on
parse trees. An innovative beam search de-
coder is proposed to efficiently find highly
probable compressions. Under this frame-
work, we show how to integrate various in-
dicative metrics such as linguistic motivation
and query relevance into the compression pro-
cess by deriving a novel formulation of a com-
pression scoring function. Our best model
achieves statistically significant improvement
over the state-of-the-art systems on several
metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in
ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and
2007 summarization task.

1 Introduction

The explosion of the Internet clearly warrants
the development of techniques for organizing and
presenting information to users in an effective
way. Query-focused multi-document summariza-
tion (MDS) methods have been proposed as one
such technique and have attracted significant at-
tention in recent years. The goal of query-focused
MDS is to synthesize a brief (often fixed-length)
and well-organized summary from a set of topic-
related documents that answer a complex ques-
tion or address a topic statement. The result-
ing summaries, in turn, can support a number of
information analysis applications including open-
ended question answering, recommender systems,
and summarization of search engine results. As
further evidence of its importance, the Document
Understanding Conference (DUC) has used query-
focused MDS as its main task since 2004 to foster

new research on automatic summarization in the
context of users’ needs.

To date, most top-performing systems for
multi-document summarization—whether query-
specific or not—remain largely extractive: their
summaries are comprised exclusively of sen-
tences selected directly from the documents
to be summarized (Erkan and Radev, 2004;
Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz
and Hakkani-Tür, 2011). Despite their simplicity,
extractive approaches have some disadvantages.
First, lengthy sentences that are partly relevant
are either excluded from the summary or (if se-
lected) can block the selection of other important
sentences, due to summary length constraints.
In addition, when people write summaries, they
tend to abstract the content and seldom use
entire sentences taken verbatim from the original
documents. In news articles, for example, most
sentences are lengthy and contain both potentially
useful information for a summary as well as un-
necessary details that are better omitted. Consider
the following DUC query as input for a MDS
system:1 “In what ways have stolen artworks
been recovered? How often are suspects arrested
or prosecuted for the thefts?” One manually gen-
erated summary includes the following sentence
but removes the bracketed words in gray:

A man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection

of [hundreds of ancient] Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in

New York [11 years ago] was arrested [Thursday at his South

Los Angeles home, where he had been hiding the antiquities,

police said].

In this example, the compressed sentence is rela-

tively more succinct and readable than the origi-
nal (e.g. in terms of Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
Score (Kincaid et al., 1975)). Likewise, removing
information irrelevant to the query (e.g. “11 years
ago”, “police said”) is crucial for query-focused
MDS.

Sentence compression techniques (Knight and
Marcu, 2000; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) are the
standard for producing a compact and grammat-
ical version of a sentence while preserving rel-
evance, and prior research (e.g. Lin (2003)) has
demonstrated their potential usefulness for generic
document summarization. Similarly, strides have
been made to incorporate sentence compression
into query-focused MDS systems (Zajic et al.,
2006). Most attempts, however, fail to produce
better results than those of the best systems built
on pure extraction-based approaches that use no
sentence compression.

In this paper we investigate the role of sentence
compression techniques for query-focused MDS.
We extend existing work in the area first by inves-
tigating the role of learning-based sentence com-
pression techniques. In addition, we design three
types of approaches to sentence-compression—
rule-based, sequence-based and tree-based—and
examine them within our compression-based
framework for query-specific MDS. Our top-
performing sentence compression algorithm in-
corporates measures of query relevance, con-
tent importance, redundancy and language qual-
ity, among others. Our tree-based methods rely on
a scoring function that allows for easy and flexi-
ble tailoring of sentence compression to the sum-
marization task, ultimately resulting in significant
improvements for MDS, while at the same time
remaining competitive with existing methods in
terms of sentence compression, as discussed next.

We evaluate the summarization models on
the standard Document Understanding Confer-
ence (DUC) 2006 and 2007 corpora 2 for query-
focused MDS and find that all of our compression-
based summarization models achieve statistically
significantly better performance than the best
DUC 2006 systems. Our best-performing sys-
tem yields an 11.02 ROUGE-2 score (Lin and
Hovy, 2003), a 8.0% improvement over the best
reported score (10.2 (Davis et al., 2012)) on the

2We believe that we can easily adapt our system for tasks
(e.g. TAC-08’s opinion summarization or TAC-09’s update
summarization) or domains (e.g. web pages or wikipedia
pages). We reserve that for future work.

DUC 2006 dataset, and an 13.49 ROUGE-2, a
5.4% improvement over the best score in DUC
2007 (12.8 (Davis et al., 2012)). We also ob-
serve substantial improvements over previous sys-
tems w.r.t. the manual Pyramid (Nenkova and
Passonneau, 2004) evaluation measure (26.4 vs.
22.9 (Jagarlamudi et al., 2006)); human annota-
tors furthermore rate our system-generated sum-
maries as having less redundancy and compara-
ble quality w.r.t. other linguistic quality metrics.
With these results we believe we are the first
to successfully show that sentence compression
can provide statistically significant improvements
over pure extraction-based approaches for query-
focused MDS.

2 Related Work

Existing research on query-focused multi-
document summarization (MDS) largely relies
on extractive approaches, where systems usually
take as input a set of documents and select
the top relevant sentences for inclusion in the
final summary. A wide range of methods have
been employed for this task. For unsupervised
methods, sentence importance can be estimated
by calculating topic signature words (Lin and
Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006), combining
query similarity and document centrality within
a graph-based model (Otterbacher et al., 2005),
or using a Bayesian model with sophisticated
inference (Daumé and Marcu, 2006). Davis et
al. (2012) first learn the term weights by Latent
Semantic Analysis, and then greedily select
sentences that cover the maximum combined
weights. Supervised approaches have mainly
focused on applying discriminative learning for
ranking sentences (Fuentes et al., 2007). Lin and
Bilmes (2011) use a class of carefully designed
submodular functions to reward the diversity of
the summaries and select sentences greedily.

Our work is more related to the less studied
area of sentence compression as applied to (sin-
gle) document summarization. Zajic et al. (2006)
tackle the query-focused MDS problem using a
compress-first strategy: they develop heuristics to
generate multiple alternative compressions of all
sentences in the original document; these then be-
come the candidates for extraction. This approach,
however, does not outperform some extraction-
based approaches. A similar idea has been stud-
ied for MDS (Lin, 2003; Gillick and Favre, 2009),

1385



but limited improvement is observed over extrac-
tive baselines with simple compression rules. Fi-
nally, although learning-based compression meth-
ods are promising (Martins and Smith, 2009;
Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), it is unclear how
well they handle issues of redundancy.

Our research is also inspired by probabilis-
tic sentence-compression approaches, such as the
noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu, 2000;
Turner and Charniak, 2005), and its extension via
synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Aho
and Ullman, 1969; Lewis and Stearns, 1968) for
robust probability estimation (Galley and McKe-
own, 2007). Rather than attempt to derive a new
parse tree like Knight and Marcu (2000) and Gal-
ley and McKeown (2007), we learn to safely re-
move a set of constituents in our parse tree-based
compression model while preserving grammati-
cal structure and essential content. Sentence-level
compression has also been examined via a dis-
criminative model McDonald (2006), and Clarke
and Lapata (2008) also incorporate discourse in-
formation by using integer linear programming.

3 The Framework

We now present our query-focused MDS frame-
work consisting of three steps: Sentence Rank-
ing, Sentence Compression and Post-processing.
First, sentence ranking determines the importance
of each sentence given the query. Then, a sen-
tence compressor iteratively generates the most
likely succinct versions of the ranked sentences,
which are cumulatively added to the summary, un-
til a length limit is reached. Finally, the post-
processing stage applies coreference resolution
and sentence reordering to build the summary.

Sentence Ranking. This stage aims to rank sen-
tences in order of relevance to the query. Un-
surprisingly, ranking algorithms have been suc-
cessfully applied to this task. We experimented
with two of them – Support Vector Regres-
sion (SVR) (Mozer et al., 1997) and Lamb-
daMART (Burges et al., 2007). The former
has been used previously for MDS (Ouyang et
al., 2011). LambdaMart on the other hand has
shown considerable success in information re-
trieval tasks (Burges, 2010); we are the first to
apply it to summarization. For training, we use
40 topics (i.e. queries) from the DUC 2005 cor-
pus (Dang, 2005) along with their manually gener-
ated abstracts. As in previous work (Shen and Li,

2011; Ouyang et al., 2011), we use the ROUGE-
2 score, which measures bigram overlap between
a sentence and the abstracts, as the objective for
regression.

While space limitations preclude a longer dis-
cussion of the full feature set (ref. Table 1), we
describe next the query-relevant features used for
sentence ranking as these are the most impor-
tant for our summarization setting. The goal of
this feature subset is to determine the similarity
between the query and each candidate sentence.
When computing similarity, we remove stopwords
as well as the words “discuss, describe, specify,
explain, identify, include, involve, note” that are
adopted and extended from Conroy et al. (2006).
Then we conduct simple query expansion based
on the title of the topic and cross-document coref-
erence resolution. Specifically, we first add the
words from the topic title to the query. And for
each mention in the query, we add other mentions
within the set of documents that corefer with this
mention. Finally, we compute two versions of the
features—one based on the original query and an-
other on the expanded one. We also derive the
semantic role overlap and relation instance over-
lap between the query and each sentence. Cross-
document coreference resolution, semantic role la-
beling and relation extraction are accomplished
via the methods described in Section 5.

Sentence Compression. As the main focus of
this paper, we propose three types of compression
methods, described in detail in Section 4 below.

Post-processing. Post-processing performs
coreference resolution and sentence ordering.

We replace each pronoun with its referent unless
they appear in the same sentence. For sentence
ordering, each compressed sentence is assigned
to the most similar (tf-idf) query sentence. Then
a Chronological Ordering algorithm (Barzilay et
al., 2002) sorts the sentences for each query based
first on the time stamp, and then the position in
the source document.

4 Sentence Compression

Sentence compression is typically formulated as
the problem of removing secondary information
from a sentence while maintaining its grammati-
cality and semantic structure (Knight and Marcu,
2000; McDonald, 2006; Galley and McKeown,
2007; Clarke and Lapata, 2008). We leave other
rewrite operations, such as paraphrasing and re-
ordering, for future work. Below we describe
the sentence compression approaches developed
in this research: RULE-BASED COMPRESSION,
SEQUENCE-BASED COMPRESSION, and TREE-
BASED COMPRESSION.

4.1 Rule-based Compression

Turner and Charniak (2005) have shown that ap-
plying hand-crafted rules for trimming sentences
can improve both content and linguistic qual-
ity. Our rule-based approach extends existing
work (Conroy et al., 2006; Toutanova et al., 2007)
to create the linguistically-motivated compression
rules of Table 2. To avoid ill-formed output, we
disallow compressions of more than 10 words by
each rule.

4.2 Sequence-based Compression

As in McDonald (2006) and Clarke and Lapata
(2008), our sequence-based compression model
makes a binary “keep-or-delete” decision for each
word in the sentence. In contrast, however, we

nodes to be dropped are grayed out. In this example,
the root of the gray subtree (a “PP”) would be labeled
REMOVE. Its siblings and parent are labeled RETAIN
and PARTIAL, respectively. The trimmed tree is real-
ized as “Malaria causes millions of deaths.”

view compression as a sequential tagging problem
and make use of linear-chain Conditional Ran-
dom Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) to se-
lect the most likely compression. We represent
each sentence as a sequence of tokens, X =
x0x1 . . . xn, and generate a sequence of labels,
Y = y0y1 . . . yn, that encode which tokens are
kept, using a BIO label format: {B-RETAIN de-
notes the beginning of a retained sequence, I-
RETAIN indicates tokens “inside” the retained se-
quence, O marks tokens to be removed}.

The CRF model is built using the features
shown in Table 3. “Dependency Tree Features”
encode the grammatical relations in which each
word is involved as a dependent. For the “Syntac-
tic Tree”, “Dependency Tree” and “Rule-Based”
features, we also include features for the two
words that precede and the two that follow the cur-
rent word. Detailed descriptions of the training
data and experimental setup are in Section 5.

During inference, we find the maximally likely
sequence Y according to a CRF with parameter
θ (Y = argmaxY ′ P (Y ′|X; θ)), while simulta-
neously enforcing the rules of Table 2 to reduce
the hypothesis space and encourage grammatical
compression. To do this, we encode these rules as
features for each token, and whenever these fea-
ture functions fire, we restrict the possible label
for that token to “O”.

4.3 Tree-based Compression

Our tree-based compression methods are in line
with syntax-driven approaches (Galley and McK-
eown, 2007), where operations are carried out
on parse tree constituents. Unlike previous
work (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Galley and McK-
eown, 2007), we do not produce a new parse tree,

Table 2: Linguistically-motivated rules for sentence compression. The grayed-out words in brackets are removed.

but focus on learning to identify the proper set of
constituents to be removed. In particular, when a
node is dropped from the tree, all words it sub-
sumes will be deleted from the sentence.

Formally, given a parse tree T of the sentence
to be compressed and a tree traversal algorithm,
T can be presented as a list of ordered constituent
nodes, T = t0t1 . . . tm. Our objective is to find a
set of labels, L = l0l1 . . . lm, where li ∈ {RETAIN,
REMOVE, PARTIAL}. RETAIN (RET) and RE-
MOVE (REM) denote whether the node ti is re-
tained or removed. PARTIAL (PAR) means ti is
partly removed, i.e. at least one child subtree of ti
is dropped.

Labels are identified, in order, according to the
tree traversal algorithm. Every node label needs
to be compatible with the labeling history: given
a node ti, and a set of labels l0 . . . li−1 predicted
for nodes t0 . . . ti−1, li =RET or li =REM is com-
patible with the history when all children of ti are
labeled as RET or REM, respectively; li =PAR is
compatible when ti has at least two descendents
tj and tk (j < i and k < i), one of which is
RETained and the other, REMoved. As such, the
root of the gray subtree in Figure 1 is labeled as
REM; its left siblings as RET; its parent as PAR.

As the space of possible compressions is expo-
nential in the number of leaves in the parse tree,
instead of looking for the globally optimal solu-
tion, we use beam search to find a set of highly
likely compressions and employ a language model
trained on a large corpus for evaluation.

A Beam Search Decoder. The beam search de-
coder (see Algorithm 1) takes as input the sen-
tence’s parse tree T = t0t1 . . . tm, an order-
ing O for traversing T (e.g. postorder) as a se-
quence of nodes in T , the set L of possible
node labels, a scoring function S for evaluat-
ing each sentence compression hypothesis, and
a beam size N . Specifically, O is a permuta-
tion on the set {0, 1, . . . ,m}—each element an

index onto T . Following O, T is re-ordered as
tO0tO1 . . . tOm , and the decoder considers each or-
dered constituent tOi in turn. In iteration i, all
existing sentence compression hypotheses are ex-
panded by one node, tOi , labeling it with all com-
patible labels. The new hypotheses (usually sub-
sentences) are ranked by the scorer S and the top
N are preserved to be extended in the next itera-
tion. See Figure 2 for an example.

Input : parse tree T , ordering O = O0O1 . . . Om,
L ={RET, REM, PAR}, hypothesis scorer S,
beam size N

Output: N best compressions

foreach node tOi in T = tO0 . . . tOm do

if i == 0 (first node visited) then

end
else

newStack← Φ (empty set);
foreach hypothesis h in stack do

foreach label lOi in L do
if lOi is compatible then

newHypothesis h′ ← h + [lOi ];
put h′ into newStack;

end
end

end
stack← newStack;

end
Apply S to sort hypotheses in stack in descending
order;
Keep the N best hypotheses in stack;

end

Algorithm 1: Beam search decoder.

Our BASIC Tree-based Compression in-
stantiates the beam search decoder with
postorder traversal and a hypothesis scorer
that takes a possible sentence compression—
a sequence of nodes (e.g. tO0 . . . tOk ) and
their labels (e.g. lO0 . . . lOk )—and returns∑k

j=1 logP (lOj |tOj ) (denoted later as
ScoreBasic). The probability is estimated by
a Maximum Entropy classifier (Berger et al.,

1388

ses (boxed) are ranked based on the scores in parenthe-
ses. Beam scores for other nodes are omitted.

Rule-Based Features
For each rule in Table 2 , we construct a corresponding feature to indicate
whether the token is identified by the rule.

pression. ∗ or † denote features that are concatenated
with every Syntactic Tree feature to compose a new

1996) trained at the constituent level using the
features in Table 4. We also apply the rules of
Table 2 during the decoding process. Concretely,
if the words subsumed by a node are identified
by any rule, we only consider REM as the node’s
label.

Given the N -best compressions from the de-
coder, we evaluate the yield of the trimmed trees
using a language model trained on the Giga-
word (Graff, 2003) corpus and return the compres-
sion with the highest probability. Thus, the de-
coder is quite flexible — its learned scoring func-
tion allows us to incorporate features salient for
sentence compression while its language model
guarantees the linguistic quality of the compressed
string. In the sections below we consider addi-
tional improvements.

4.3.1 Improving Beam Search
CONTEXT-aware search is based on the intu-
ition that predictions on preceding context can
be leveraged to facilitate the prediction of the
current node. For example, parent nodes with

children that have all been removed (retained)
should have a label of REM (RET). In light of
this, we encode these contextual predictions as
additional features of S, that is, ALL-CHILDREN-
REMOVED/RETAINED, ANY-LEFTSIBLING-
REMOVED/RETAINED/PARTLY REMOVED,
LABEL-OF-LEFT-SIBLING/HEAD-NODE.

HEAD-driven search modifies the BASIC pos-
torder tree traversal by visiting the head node first
at each level, leaving other orders unchanged. In
a nutshell, if the head node is dropped, then its
modifiers need not be preserved. We adopt the
same features as CONTEXT-aware search, but re-
move those involving left siblings. We also add
one more feature: LABEL-OF-THE-HEAD-NODE-
IT-MODIFIES.

4.3.2 Task-Specific Sentence Compression
The current scorer ScoreBasic is still fairly naive
in that it focuses only on features of the sen-
tence to be compressed. However extra-sentential
knowledge can also be important for query-
focused MDS. For example, information regard-
ing relevance to the query might lead the de-
coder to produce compressions better suited for
the summary. Towards this goal, we construct
a compression scoring function—the multi-scorer
(MULTI)—that allows the incorporation of mul-
tiple task-specific scorers. Given a hypothesis at
any stage of decoding, which yields a sequence of
words W = w0w1...wj , we propose the following
component scorers.

Query Relevance. Query information ought to
guide the compressor to identify the relevant con-
tent. The query Q is expanded as described in
Section 3. Let |W ∩ Q| denote the number of
unique overlapping words betweenW andQ, then
scoreq = |W ∩Q|/|W |.

Importance. A query-independent impor-
tance score is defined as the average Sum-
Basic (Toutanova et al., 2007) value in W ,
i.e. scoreim =

∑j
i=1 SumBasic(wi)/|W |.

Language Model. We let scorelm be the proba-
bility of W computed by a language model.

Cross-Sentence Redundancy. To encourage di-
versified content, we define a redundancy score to
discount replicated content: scorered = 1− |W ∩
C|/|W |, whereC is the words already selected for
the summary.

1389



The multi-scorer is defined as a linear
combination of the component scorers: Let
~α = (α0, . . . , α4), 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1, −−−→score =
(scoreBasic, scoreq, scoreim, scorelm, scorered),

S = scoremulti = ~α · −−−→score (1)
The parameters ~α are tuned on a held-out tuning
set by grid search. We linearly normalize the score
of each metric, where the minimum and maximum
values are estimated from the tuning data.

5 Experimental Setup

We evaluate our methods on the DUC 2005, 2006
and 2007 datasets (Dang, 2005; Dang, 2006;
Dang, 2007), each of which is a collection of
newswire articles. 50 complex queries (topics) are
provided for DUC 2005 and 2006, 35 are collected
for DUC 2007 main task. Relevant documents for
each query are provided along with 4 to 9 human
MDS abstracts. The task is to generate a summary
within 250 words to address the query. We split
DUC 2005 into two parts: 40 topics to train the
sentence ranking models, and 10 for ranking algo-
rithm selection and parameter tuning for the multi-
scorer. DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 are reserved as
held out test sets.

Sentence Compression. The dataset
from Clarke and Lapata (2008) is used to
train the CRF and MaxEnt classifiers (Section 4).
It includes 82 newswire articles with one manually
produced compression aligned to each sentence.

Preprocessing. Documents are processed by a
full NLP pipeline, including token and sentence
segmentation, parsing, semantic role labeling,
and an information extraction pipeline consist-
ing of mention detection, NP coreference, cross-
document resolution, and relation detection (Flo-
rian et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2004; Luo and Zitouni,
2005).

Learning for Sentence Ranking and Compres-
sion. We use Weka (Hall et al., 2009) to train a
support vector regressor and experiment with var-
ious rankers in RankLib (Dang, 2011)3. As Lamb-
daMART has an edge over other rankers on the
held-out dataset, we selected it to produce ranked
sentences for further processing. For sequence-
based compression using CRFs, we employ Mal-

3Default parameters are used. If an algorithm needs a val-
idation set, we use 10 out of 40 topics.

MaxEnt classifiers are used for tree-based com-
pression. Beam size is fixed at 2000.4 Sen-
tence compressions are evaluated by a 5-gram lan-
guage model trained on Gigaword (Graff, 2003)
by SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).

6 Results

The results in Table 5 use the official ROUGE soft-
ware with standard options5 and report ROUGE-
2 (R-2) (measures bigram overlap) and ROUGE-
SU4 (R-SU4) (measures unigram and skip-bigram
separated by up to four words). We compare our
sentence-compression-based methods to the best
performing systems based on ROUGE in DUC
2006 and 2007 (Jagarlamudi et al., 2006; Pingali
et al., 2007), system by Davis et al. (2012) that
report the best R-2 score on DUC 2006 and 2007
thus far, and to the purely extractive methods of
SVR and LambdaMART.

Our sentence-compression-based systems
(marked with †) show statistically significant
improvements over pure extractive summarization
for both R-2 and R-SU4 (paired t-test, p < 0.01).
This means our systems can effectively remove
redundancy within the summary through compres-
sion. Furthermore, our HEAD-driven beam search
method with MULTI-scorer beats all systems on
DUC 20066 and all systems on DUC 2007 except
the best system in terms of R-2 (p < 0.01). Its
R-SU4 score is also significantly (p < 0.01)
better than extractive methods, rule-based and
sequence-based compression methods on both
DUC 2006 and 2007. Moreover, our systems with
learning-based compression have considerable
compression rates, indicating their capability to
remove superfluous words as well as improve
summary quality.

Human Evaluation. The Pyramid (Nenkova
and Passonneau, 2004) evaluation was developed
to manually assess how many relevant facts or
Summarization Content Units (SCUs) are cap-
tured by system summaries. We ask a professional
annotator (who is not one of the authors, is highly
experienced in annotating for various NLP tasks,
and is fluent in English) to carry out a Pyramid
evaluation on 10 randomly selected topics from

4We looked at various beam sizes on the heldout data, and
observed that the performance peaks around this value.

ROUGE scores in DUC 2006 (Jagarlamudi et al.,

We further evaluate the linguistic quality (LQ)
of the summaries for the same 10 topics in ac-
cordance with the measurement in Dang (2006).
Four native speakers who are undergraduate stu-
dents in computer science (none are authors) per-

ROUGE scores (Jagarlamudi et al., 2006) (Best
DUC system (ROUGE)) and top linguistic quality
scores (Lacatusu et al., 2006) (Best DUC system

for each metric is displayed in Table 6. Our sys-
tem achieves a higher Pyramid score, an indication
that it captures more of the salient facts. We also

and coherence), and overall responsiveness on DUC 2006.

attain better non-redundancy than Jagarlamudi et
al. (2006), meaning that human raters perceive
less replicative content in our summaries. Scores
for other metrics are comparable to Jagarlamudi
et al. (2006) and Lacatusu et al. (2006), which
either uses minimal non-learning-based compres-
sion rules or is a pure extractive system. However,
our compression system sometimes generates less
grammatical sentences, and those are mostly due
to parsing errors. For example, parsing a clause
starting with a past tense verb as an adverbial
clausal modifier can lead to an ill-formed com-
pression. Those issues can be addressed by an-
alyzing k-best parse trees and we leave it in the
future work. A sample summary from our multi-
scorer based system is in Figure 3.

Sentence Compression Evaluation. We
also evaluate sentence compression separately
on (Clarke and Lapata, 2008), adopting the same
partitions as (Martins and Smith, 2009), i.e. 1, 188
sentences for training and 441 for testing. Our
compression models are compared with Hedge
Trimmer (Dorr et al., 2003), a discriminative
model proposed by McDonald (2006) and a

all use single-scorer. Our context-aware and head-driven tree-based approaches outperform all the other systems
significantly (p < 0.01) in precision (Uni-Prec) without sacrificing the recalls (i.e. there is no statistically signifi-
cant difference between our models and McDonald (2006) / M & S (2009) with p > 0.05). Italicized numbers for
unigram F1 (Uni-F1) are statistically indistinguishable (p > 0.05). Our head-driven tree-based approach also pro-
duces significantly better grammatical relations F1 scores (Rel-F1) than all the other systems except the rule-based

Topic D0626H: How were the bombings of the US em-
bassies in Kenya and Tanzania conducted? What terror-
ist groups and individuals were responsible? How and
where were the attacks planned?
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) – President Bill
Clinton Thursday condemned terrorist bomb attacks at
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed to find
the bombers and bring them to justice. Clinton met with
his top aides Wednesday in the White House to assess the
situation following the twin bombings at U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, which have killed more than 250
people and injured over 5,000, most of them Kenyans and
Tanzanians. Local sources said the plan to bomb U.S. em-
bassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to com-
plete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched
through Somali and Rwanda. FBI Director Louis Freeh,
Attorney General Janet Reno and other senior U.S. gov-
ernment officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m.
EDT (1700GMT) at FBI headquarters in Washington “to
announce developments in the investigation of the bomb-
ings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,” the
FBI said in a statement. ...

dependency-tree based compressor (Martins and
Smith, 2009)8. We adopt the metrics in Martins
and Smith (2009) to measure the unigram-level
macro precision, recall, and F1-measure with
respect to human annotated compression. In
addition, we also compute the F1 scores of
grammatical relations which are annotated by
RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) according
to Clarke and Lapata (2008).

ing the recalls (Uni-Rec) significantly (p > 0.05)
based on a paired t-test. Unigram F1 scores (Uni-
F1) in italics indicate that the corresponding sys-
tems are not statistically distinguishable (p >
0.05). For grammatical relation evaluation, our
head-driven tree-based system obtains statistically
significantly (p < 0.01) better F1 score (Rel-F1
than all the other systems except the rule-based
system).

7 Conclusion

We have presented a framework for query-focused
multi-document summarization based on sentence
compression. We propose three types of com-
pression approaches. Our tree-based compres-
sion method can easily incorporate measures of
query relevance, content importance, redundancy
and language quality into the compression pro-
cess. By testing on a standard dataset using the
automatic metric ROUGE, our models show sub-
stantial improvement over pure extraction-based
methods and state-of-the-art systems. Our best
system also yields better results for human eval-
uation based on Pyramid and achieves comparable
linguistic quality scores.
