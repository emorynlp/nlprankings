Abstract

Polarity classification of opinionated sen-
tences with both positive and negative senti-
ments1 is a key challenge in sentiment anal-
ysis. This paper presents a novel unsuper-
vised method for discovering intra-sentence
level discourse relations for eliminating polar-
ity ambiguities. Firstly, a discourse scheme
with discourse constraints on polarity was de-
fined empirically based on Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST). Then, a small set of cue-
phrase-based patterns were utilized to collect
a large number of discourse instances which
were later converted to semantic sequential
representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsuper-
vised method was adopted to generate, weigh
and filter new SSRs without cue phrases for
recognizing discourse relations. Experimen-
tal results showed that the proposed methods
not only effectively recognized the defined
discourse relations but also achieved signifi-
cant improvement by integrating discourse in-
formation in sentence-level polarity classifica-
tion.

1 Introduction

As an important task of sentiment analysis, polar-
ity classification is critically affected by discourse
structure (Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006). Previous re-
search developed discourse schema (Asher et al.,
2008) (Somasundaran et al., 2008) and proved that
the utilization of discourse relations could improve
the performance of polarity classification on dia-
logues (Somasundaran et al., 2009). However, cur-

1Defined as ambiguous sentences in this paper

rent state-of-the-art methods for sentence-level po-
larity classification are facing difficulties in ascer-
taining the polarity of some sentences. For example:

(a) [Although Fujimori was criticized by the international
community]，[he was loved by the domestic population]，
[because people hated the corrupted ruling class]. (儘管
國際間對藤森口誅筆伐，他在國內一直深受百姓愛
戴，原因是百姓對腐化的統治階級早就深惡痛絕。)

Example (a) is a positive sentence holding a Con-
trast relation between first two segments and a
Cause relation between last two segments. The po-
larity of "criticized", "hated" and "corrupted" are rec-
ognized as negative expressions while "loved" is rec-
ognized as a positive expression. Example (a) is dif-
ficult for existing polarity classification methods for
two reasons: (1) the number of positive expressions
is less than negative expressions; (2) the importance
of each sentiment expression is unknown. However,
consider Figure 1, if we know that the polarity of
the first two segments holding a Contrast relation
is determined by the nucleus (Mann and Thompson,
1988) segment and the polarity of the last two seg-
ments holding aCause relation is also determined by
the nucleus segment, the polarity of the sentence will
be determined by the polarity of "[he...population]".
Thus, the polarity of Example (a) is positive.
Statistics showed that 43% of the opinionated

sentences in NTCIR2 MOAT (Multilingual Opinion
Analysis Task) Chinese corpus3 are ambiguous. Ex-
isting sentence-level polarity classification methods
ignoring discourse structure often give wrong results
for these sentences. We implemented state-of-the-

art method (Xu and Kit, 2010) in NTCIR-8 Chinese
MOAT as the baseline polarity classifier (BPC) in
this paper. Error analysis of BPC showed that 49%
errors came from ambiguous sentences.
In this paper, we focused on the automation of

recognizing intra-sentence level discourse relations
for polarity classification. Based on the previous
work of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann
and Thompson, 1988), a discourse scheme with dis-
course constraints on polarity was defined empiri-
cally (see Section 3). The scheme contains 5 rela-
tions: Contrast, Condition, Continuation, Cause and
Purpose. From a raw corpus, a small set of cue-
phrase-based patterns were used to collect discourse
instances. These instances were then converted to
semantic sequential representations (SSRs). Finally,
an unsupervised SSR learner was adopted to gener-
ate, weigh and filter high quality new SSRs with-
out cue phrases. Experimental results showed that
the proposed methods could effectively recognize
the defined discourse relations and achieve signifi-
cant improvement in sentence-level polarity classi-
fication comparing to BPC.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-

lows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Sec-
tion 3 presents the discourse scheme with discourse
constraints on polarity. Section 4 gives the detail of
proposed method. Experimental results are reported
and discussed in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes
this paper.

2 Related Work

Research on polarity classification were generally
conducted on 4 levels: document-level (Pang et al.,
2002), sentence-level (Riloff et al., 2003), phrase-
level (Wilson et al., 2009) and feature-level (Hu and
Liu, 2004; Xia et al., 2007).
There was little research focusing on the auto-

matic recognition of intra-sentence level discourse

relations for sentiment analysis in the literature.
Polanyi and Zaenen (2006) argued that valence cal-
culation is critically affected by discourse struc-
ture. Asher et al. (2008) proposed a shallow se-
mantic representation using a feature structure and
use five types of rhetorical relations to build a fine-
grained corpus for deep contextual sentiment anal-
ysis. Nevertheless, they did not propose a com-
putational model for their discourse scheme. Sny-
der and Barzilay (2007) combined an agreement
model based on contrastive RST relations with a lo-
cal aspect model to make a more informed over-
all decision for sentiment classification. Nonethe-
less, contrastive relations were only one type of dis-
course relations which may help polarity classifica-
tion. Sadamitsu et al. (2008) modeled polarity re-
versal using HCRFs integrated with inter-sentence
discourse structures. However, our work is on intra-
sentence level and our purpose is not to find polar-
ity reversals but trying to adapt general discourse
schemes (e.g., RST) to help determine the overall
polarity of ambiguous sentences.
The most closely related works were (Somasun-

daran et al., 2008) and (Somasundaran et al., 2009),
which proposed opinion frames as a representation
of discourse-level associations on dialogue andmod-
eled the scheme to improve opinion polarity clas-
sification. However, opinion frames was difficult
to be implemented because the recognition of opin-
ion target was very challenging in general text. Our
work differs from their approaches in two key as-
pects: (1) we distinguished nucleus and satellite in
discourse but opinion frames did not; (2) our method
for discourse discovery was unsupervised while their
method needed annotated data.
Most research works about discourse classifica-

tion were not related to sentiment analysis. Su-
pervised discourse classification methods (Soricut
and Marcu, 2003; Duverle and Prendinger, 2009)
needed manually annotated data. Marcu and Echi-
habi (2002) presented an unsupervised method to
recognize discourse relations held between arbitrary
spans of text. They showed that lexical pairs ex-
tracted from massive amount of data can have a
major impact on discourse classification. Blair-
Goldensohn et al. (2007) extended Marcu's work by
using parameter opitimization, topic segmentation
and syntactic parsing. However, syntactic parsers

163



were usually costly and impractical when dealing
with large scale of text. Thus, in additional to lex-
ical features, we incorporated sequential and seman-
tic information in proposed method for discourse re-
lation classification. Moreover, our method kept the
characteristic of language independent, so it could be
applied to other languages.

3 Discourse Scheme for Eliminating
Polarity Ambiguities

Since not all of the discourse relations in RST
would help eliminate polarity ambiguities, the dis-
course scheme defined in this paper was on a much
coarser level. In order to ascertain which relations
should be included in our scheme, 500 ambigu-
ous sentences were randomly chosen from NTCIR
MOAT Chinese corpus and the most common dis-
course relations for connecting independent clauses
in compound sentences were annotated. We found
that 13 relations from RST occupied about 70% of
the annotated discourse relations which may help
eliminate polarity ambiguities. Inspired by Marcu
and Echihabi (2002), to construct relatively low-
noise discourse instances for unsupervised methods
using cue phrases, we grouped the 13 relations into
the following 5 relations:

Contrast is a union of Antithesis, Concession, Oth-
erwise and Contrast from RST.

Condition is selected from RST.
Continuation is a union of Continuation, Parallel

from RST.
Cause is a union of Evidence, Volitional-Cause,

Nonvolitional-Cause, Volitional-result and
Nonvolitional-result from RST.

Purpose is selected from RST.

The discourse constraints on polarity presented
here were based on the observation of annotated dis-
course instances: (1) discourse instances holding
Contrast relation should contain two segments with
opposite polarities; (2) discourse instances hold-
ing Continuation relation should contain two seg-
ments with the same polarity; (3) the polarity of dis-
course instances holdingContrast,Condition,Cause
or Purpose was determined by the nucleus segment;
(4) the polarity of discourse instances holding Con-
tinuation was determined by either segment.

4 Methods

The proposed methods were based on two as-
sumptions: (1) Cue-phrase-based patterns could be
used to find limited number of high quality discourse
instances; (2) discourse relations were determined
by lexical, structural and semantic information be-
tween two segments.
Cue-phrase-based patterns could find only lim-

ited number of discourse instances with high pre-
cision (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). Therefore, we
could not rely on cue-phrase-based patterns alone.
Moreover, there was no annotated corpus similar to
Penn Discourse TreeBank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004)
in other languages such as Chinese. Thus, we pro-
posed a language independent unsupervised method
to identify discourse relations without cue phrases
while maintaining relatively high precision. For
each discourse relation, we started with several cue-
phrase-based patterns and collected a large number
of discourse instances from raw corpus. Then, dis-
course instances were converted to semantic sequen-
tial representations (SSRs). Finally, an unsupervised
method was adopted to generate, weigh and filter
common SSRswithout cue phrases. Themined com-
mon SSRs could be directly used in our SSR-based
classifier in unsupervised manner or be employed as
effective features for supervised methods.

4.1 Gathering and representing discourse
instances

A discourse instance, denoted by Di, consists of
two successive segments (Di[1], Di[2]) within a sen-
tence. For example:

D1: [Although Boris is very brilliant at math]s, [he

164



BOS... ，[CUE2]...EOS
BOS [CUE1]... ，...EOS
BOS... ，[CUE1]...EOS
BOS [CUE1]... ，[CUE2]...EOS

Table 2: Cue-phrase-based patterns. BOS and EOS de-
noted the beginning and end of two segments.

is a horrible teacher]n
D2: [John is good at basketball]s, [but he lacks team
spirit]n
In D1, "although" indicated the satellite section

while inD2, "but" indicated the nucleus section. Ac-
cordingly, different cue phrases may indicate differ-
ent segment type. Table 1 listed some examples of
cue phrases for each discourse relation. Some cue
phrases were singleton (e.g. "although" and "as a re-
sult") and some were used as a pair (e.g. "not only,
but also"). "CUE1" indicated satellite segments and
"CUE2" indicated nucleus segments. Note that we
did not distinguish satellite from nucleus for Con-
tinuation in this paper because the polarity could be
determined by either segment.
Table 2 listed cue-phrase-based patterns for all re-

lations. To simplify the problem of discourse seg-
mentation, we split compound sentences into dis-
course segments using commas and semicolons. Al-
though we collected discourse instances from com-
pound sentences only, the number of instances for
each discourse relation was large enough for the pro-
posed unsupervised method. Note that we only col-
lected instances containing at least one sentiment
word in each segment.
In order to incorporate lexical and semantic infor-

mation in our method, we represented each word in
a discourse instance using a part-of-speech tag, a se-
mantic label and a sentiment tag. Then, all discourse
instances were converted to SSRs. The rules for con-
verting were as follows:
(1) Cue phrases and punctuations were ingored.

But the information of nucleus(n) and satellite(s)
was preserved.
(2) Adverbs(RB) appearing in sentiment lexicon,

verbs(V ), adjectives(JJ ) and nouns(NN) were repre-
sented by their part-of-speech (pos) tag with seman-
tic label (semlabel) if available.
(3) Named entities (NE; PER: person name;ORG:

organization), pronouns (PRP), and function words

were represented by their corresponding named en-
tity tags and part-of-speech tags, respectively.
(4) Added sentiment tag (P : Positive; N : Nega-

tive) to all sentiment words.
By applying above rules, the SSRs for D1 and D2

would be:
d1: [PERV|Ja01 RB|Ka01 JJ|Ee14|P IN NN|Dk03]s
, [PRP V|Ja01 DT JJ|Ga16|N NN|Ae13 ]n
d2: [PER V|Ja01 JJ|Ee14|P IN NN|Bp12]s, [PRP
V|He15|N NN|Di10 NN|Dd08 ]n
Refer to d1 and d2, "Boris" could match "John"

in SSRs because they were converted to "PER" and
they all appeared at the beginning of discourse in-
stances. "Ja01", "Ee14" etc. were semantic labels
from Chinese synonym list extended version (Che et
al., 2010). There were similar resources in other lan-
guages such asWordnet(Fellbaum, 1998) in English.
The next problem became how to start from current
SSRs and generate new SSRs for recognizing dis-
course relations without cue phrases.

4.2 Mining common SSRs

Recall assumption (2), in order to incorporate lex-
ical, structural and semantic information for the sim-
ilarity calculation of two SSRs holding the same
discourse relation, three types of matches were de-
fined for {(u, v)|u ∈ di[k], v ∈ dj[k], k = 1, 2}:
(1)Full match: (i) u = v or (ii) u.pos = v.pos and
u.semlabel=v.semlabel or (iii) u.pos=v.pos and
u had a sentiment tag and v had a sentiment tag or
(iv) u.pos and v.pos∈{PRP, PER, ORG} (2) Partial
match: u.pos = v.pos but not Full match; (3) Mis-
match: u.pos ̸= v.pos.

Generating common SSRs
Intuitively, a simple way of estimating the simi-

larity between two SSRs was using the number of
mismatches. Therefore, we utilized match(di, dj)
where i ̸= j, which integrated the three types of
matches defined above to calculate the number of
mismatches and generate common SSRs. Consider
Table 3, in common SSRs, full matches were pre-
served, partial matches were replaced by part of
speech tags and mismatches were replaced by '*'s.
The common SSRs generated during the calculation
of match(di, dj) consisted of two parts. The first
part was generated by di[1] and dj[1] and the second
part was generated by di[2] and dj[2]. We stipulated

that di and dj could generate a common SSR if and
only if the orders of nucleus segment and satellite
segment were the same.
In order to guarantee relatively high quality com-

mon SSRs, we empirically set the upper threshold
of the number of mismatches as 0.5 (i.e., ≤ 1/2 of
the number of words in the generated SSR). It's not
difficult to figure out that the number of mismatches
generated in Table 3 satisfied this requirement. As a
result, for each discourse relation rn, a correspond-
ing common SSR set Sn could be obtained by adopt-
ing match(di, dj) where i ̸= j for all discourse in-
stances. An advantage of match(d1, d2) was that
the generated common SSRs preserved the sequen-
tial structure of original discourse instances. And
common SSRs allows us to build high precision dis-
course classifiers (See Section 5).

Weighing and filtering common SSRs
A problem of match(di, dj) was that it ignored

some important information by treating different
mismatches equally. For example, the adverb "very"
in "very brilliant" of D1 was not important for dis-
course recognition. In other words, the number of
mismatches in match(di, dj) could not precisely re-
flect the confidence of the generated common SSRs.
Therefore, it was needed to weigh different mis-
matches for the confidence calculation of common
SSRs.

Intuitively, if a partial match or a mismatch (de-
noted by um) occurred very frequently in the gener-
ation of common SSRs, the importance of um tends
to diminish. Inspired by the tf-idf model, given
ssri∈Sn, we utilized the following equation to esti-
mate the weight (denoted by wm) of um.

wm = −ufm · log (|Sn|/ssrfm )

where ufm denoted the frequency of um during the
generation of ssri, |Sn| denoted the size of Sn and
ssrfm denoted the number of common SSRs in Sn
containing um . All weights were normalized to
[−1, 0).
Nouns (except for named entities) and verbs were

most representative words in discourse recognition
(Marcu and Echihabi, 2002). In addition, adjectives
and adverbs appearing in sentiment lexicons were
important for polarity classification. Therefore, for
these 4 kinds of words, we utilized −1.0 for a mis-
match and −0.50 for a partial match.
As we had got the weights for all partial matches

and mismatches, the confidence of ssri∈Sn could be
calculated using the cumulation of weights of par-
tial matches and mismatches in ssri[1] and ssri[2].
Recall Table 3, conf(ssr[1]) and conf(ssr[2]) rep-
resented the confidence scores of match(di[1], dj[1])
and match(di[2], dj[2]), respectively. In order to
control the quantity and quality of mined SSRs, a
threshold minconf was introduced. ssri will be
preserved if and only if conf(ssri[1]) ≥ minconf
and conf(ssri[2]) ≥ minconf . The value of
minconf was tuned using the development data.
Finally, we combined adjacent '*'s and preserved

SSRs containing at least one notional word and at
least two words in each segment to meet the de-
mand of maintaining high precision (e.g., "[* DT
*]", "[PER *]" will be dropped). Moreover, since
many of the SSRs were duplicated, we ranked all
the generated SSRs according to their occurrences
and dropped those appearing only once in order to
preserve common SSRs. At last, SSRs appearing in
more than one common SSR set were removed for
maintaining the uniqueness of each set. The com-
mon SSR set Sn for each discourse relation rn could
be directly used in SSR-based unsupervised classi-
fiers or be employed as effective features in super-
vised methods.

5 Experiments

5.1 Annotation work and Data

We extracted all compound sentences which may
contain the defined discourse relations from opinion-
ated sentences (neutral ones were dropped) of NT-
CIR7MOAT simplified Chinese training data. 1,225
discourse instances were extracted and two annota-
tors were trained to annotate discourse relations ac-
cording to the discourse scheme defined in Section 3.
Note that we annotate both explicit and implicit dis-
course relations. The overall inter annotator agree-
ment was 86.05% and the Kappa-value was 0.8031.
Table 4 showed the distribution of annotated dis-
course relations based on the inter-annotator agree-
ment. The proportion of occurrences of each dis-
course relations varied greatly. For example, Con-
tinuation was the most common relation in anno-
tated corpus, but the occurrences of Condition rela-
tion were rare.
The experiments of this paper were performed us-

ing the following data sets:
NTC-7 contained manually annotated discourse

instances (shown in Table 4). The experiments of
discourse identification were performed on this data
set.
NTC-8 contained all opinionated sentences (neu-

tral ones were dropped) extracted from NTCIR8
MOAT simplified Chinese test data. The experi-
ments of polarity ambiguity elimination using the
identified discourse relations were performed on this
data set.
XINHUA contained simplified Chinese raw news

text from Xinhua.com (2002-2005). A word seg-
mentation tool, a part-of-speech tagging tool, a
named entity recognizer and a word sense disam-

biguation tool (Che et al., 2010) were adopted to all
sentences. The common SSRs were mined from this
data set.

5.2 Experimental Settings
Discourse relation identification
In order to systematically justify the effectiveness

of proposed unsupervised method, following exper-
iments were performed on NTC-7:
Baseline used only cue-phrase-based patterns.
M&E proposed by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).

Given a discourse instance Di, the probabilities:
P (rk|(Di[1], Di[2])) for each relation rk were esti-
mated on all text from XINHUA. Then, the most
likely discourse relation was determined by taking
the maximum over argmaxk{P (rk|(Di[1], Di[2])}.
cSSR used both cue-phrase-based patterns to-

gether with common SSRs for recognizing discourse
relations. Common SSRs were mined from dis-
course instances extracted fromXINHUAusing cue-
phrase-based patterns. Development data were ran-
domly selected for tuning minconf .
SVM was trained utilizing cue phrases, probabil-

ities from M&E, topic similarity, structure overlap,
polarity of segments and mined common SSRs (Op-
tional). The parameters of the SVM classifier were
set by a grid search on the training set. We performed
4-fold cross validation on NTC-7 to get an average
performance.
The purposes of introducing SVM in our experi-

ment were: (1) to compare the performance of cSSR
to supervised method; (2) to examine the effective-
ness of integrating common SSRs as features for su-
pervised methods.

Polarity ambiguity elimination
BPC was trained mainly utilizing punctuation,

uni-gram, bi-gram features with confidence score
output. Discourse classifiers such as Baseline, cSSR
or SVM were adopted individually for the post-
processing of BPC. Given an ambiguous sentence
which contained more than one segment, an intuitive
three-step method was adopted to integrated a dis-
course classifier and discourse constraints on polar-
ity for the post-processing of BPC:
(1) Recognize all discourse relations together with

nucleus and satellite information using a discourse
classifier. The nucleus and satellite information is

167

the performance of cSSR

acquired by cSSR if a segment pair could match a
cSSR. Otherwise, we use the annotated nucleus and
satellite information.
(2) Apply discourse constraints on polarity to

ascertain the polarity for each discourse instance.
There may be conflicts between polarities acquired
by BPC and discourse constraints on polarity (e.g.,
Two segments with the same polarity holding a Con-
trast relation). To handle this problem, we chose
the segment with higher polarity confidence and ad-
justed the polarity of the other segment using dis-
course constraints on polarity.
(3) If there was more than one discourse instance

in a single sentence, the overall polarity of the sen-
tence was determined by voting of polarities from
each discourse instance under the majority rule.

5.3 Experimental Results
Refer to Figure 2, the performance of cSSR was

significantly affected by minconf . Note that we
performed the tuning process of minconf on differ-
ent development data (1/4 instances randomly se-
lected from NTC-7) and Figure 2 showed the av-
erage performance. cSSR became Baseline when
minconf =0. A significant drop of precision was
observed when minconf was less than −2.5. The
recall remained around 0.495 when minconf ≤
−4.0. The best performance was observed when
minconf=−3.5. As a result, −3.5 was utilized as
the threshold value for cSSR in the following exper-
iments.
Table 5 presented the experimental results for dis-

course relation classification. it showed that:
(1) Cue-phrase-based patterns could find only lim-

ited number of discourse relations (34.1% of average

recall) with a very high precision (96.17% of average
precision). This is a proof of assumption (1) given
in Section 4. On the other side, M&E which only
considered word pairs between two segments of dis-
course instances got a higher recall with a large drop
of precision. The drop of precision may be caused
by the neglect of structural and semantic information
of discourse instances. However, M&E still outper-
formed Baseline in average F -score.
(2) cSSR enhanced Baseline by increasing the av-

erage recall by about 15% with only a small drop of
precision. The performance of cSSR demonstrated
that our method could effectively discover high qual-
ity common SSRs. The most remarkable improve-
ment was observed on Continuation in which the re-
call increased by almost 20% with only a minor drop
of precision. Actually, cSSR outperformed Baseline
in all discourse relations except forContrast. In Dis-
course Tree Bank (Carlson et al., 2001) only 26%
of Contrast relations were indicated by cue phrases
while in NTC-7 about 70% of Contrast were indi-
cated by cue phrases. A possible reason was that
we were dealing with Chinese news text which were
usually well written. Another important observation
was that the performance of cSSR was very close to
the result of SVM.
(3) SVM+SSRs achieved the best F -score on

Continuation and average performance. The integra-
tion of SSRs to the feature set of SVM contributed to
a remarkable increase in average F -score. The re-
sults of cSSR and SVM+SSRs demonstrated the ef-
fectiveness of common SSRs mined by the proposed
unsupervised method.
Table 6 presented the performance of integrat-

ing discourse classifiers to polarity classification.
For Baseline and cSSR, the information of nucleus
and satellite could be obtained directly from cue-

phrase-based patterns and SSRs, respectively. For
SVM+cSSR, the nucleus and satellite information
was acquired by cSSR if a segment pair could match
a cSSR. Otherwise, we used manually annotated nu-
cleus and satellite information. It's clear that the
performance of polarity classification was enhanced
with the improvement of discourse relation recogni-
tion. M&E was not included in this experiment be-
cause the performance of polarity classification was
decreased by the mis-classified discourse relations.
SVM+SSRs achieved significant (p<0.01) improve-
ment in polarity classification compared to BPC.

5.4 Discussion

Effect of weighing and filtering

To assess the contribution of weighing and filter-
ing in mining SSRs using a minimum confidence
threshold, i.e. minconf , we implemented cSSR’
without weighing and filtering on the same data set.
Consider Table 7, cSSR achieved obvious improve-
ment in Precision and F -score than cSSR’. More-
over, the total number of SSRs was greatly reduced
in cSSR with only a minor drop of recall. This was
because cSSR’ was affected by thousands of low
quality common SSRs which would be filtered in
cSSR. The result in Table 7 proved that weighing and

filtering were essential in our proposed method.
We further analyzed how the improvement was

achieved in cSSR. In our experiment, the most com-
mon mismatches were auxiliary words, named enti-
ties, adjectives or adverbs without sentiments (e.g.,
"green", "very", etc.), prepositions, numbers and
quantifiers. It's straightforward that these words
were insignificant in discourse relation classification
purpose. Moreover, these words did not belong to
the 4 kinds of most representative words. In other
words, the weights of most mismatches were calcu-
lated using the equation presented in Section 4.2 in-
stead of utilizing a unified value, i.e. −1. Recall
Table 3, the weight of "RB|Ka01" (original: "very")
was −0.298 and "DT" (original: 'a') was −0.184.
Comparing to the weights of mismatches for most
representative words (−1.0), the proposed method
successfully down weighed the words which were

tions. N denoted the number of ambiguities eliminated.

not important for discourse identification. There-
fore, weighing and filtering were able to preserve
high quality SSRs while filter out low quality SSRs
by setting the confidence threshold, i.e. minconf .

Contribution of different discourse relations
We also analyzed the contribution of different dis-

course relations in eliminating polarity ambiguities.
Refer to Figure 3, the improvement of polarity classi-
fication mainly came from three discourse relations:
Contrast, Continuation and Cause. It was straight-
forward that Contrast relation could eliminate po-
larity ambiguities because it held between two seg-
ments with opposite polarities. The contribution of
Cause relation also result from two segments holding
different polarities such as example (a) in Section 1.
However, recall Table 4, although Cause occurred
more often than Contrast, only a part of discourse
instances holding Cause relation contained two seg-
ments with the opposite polarities. Another impor-
tant relation in eliminating ambiguity was Continu-
ation. We investigated sentences with polarities cor-
rected by Continuation relation. Most of them fell
into two categories: (1) sentences with mistakenly
classified sentiments by BPC; (2) sentences with im-
plicit sentiments. For example:

(b) [France and Germany have banned human cloning at
present]，[on 20th, U.S. President George W. Bush called
for regulations of the same content to Congress] (目前，
法国和德国都禁止克隆人的胚胎，美国总统布什 20
日向国会提出，要求制定同样内容的法规。)

The first segment of example (b) was negative
("banned" expressed a negative sentiment) and a
Continuation relation held between these two seg-

ments. Consequently, the polarity of the second seg-
ment should be negative.

6 Conclusions and Future work

This paper focused on unsupervised discovery
of intra-sentence discourse relations for sentence
level polarity classification. We firstly presented a
discourse scheme based on empirical observations.
Then, an unsupervised method was proposed start-
ing from a small set of cue-phrase-based patterns to
mine high quality common SSRs for each discourse
relation. The performance of discourse classification
was further improved by employing SSRs as features
in supervisedmethods. Experimental results showed
that our methods not only effectively recognized dis-
course relations but also achieved significant im-
provement (p<0.01) in sentence level polarity clas-
sification. Although we were dealing with Chinese
text, the proposed unsupervised method could be
easily generalized to other languages.
The future work will be focused on (1) integrating

more semantic and syntactic information in proposed
unsupervised method; (2) extending our method to
inter-sentence level and then jointly modeling intra-
sentence level and inter-sentence level discourse
constraints on polarity to reach a global optimal in-
ference for polarity classification.
