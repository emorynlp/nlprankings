Abstract

We introduce a novel coreference resolution
system that models entities and events jointly.
Our iterative method cautiously constructs
clusters of entity and event mentions using lin-
ear regression to model cluster merge opera-
tions. As clusters are built, information flows
between entity and event clusters through fea-
tures that model semantic role dependencies.
Our system handles nominal and verbal events
as well as entities, and our joint formulation
allows information from event coreference to
help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a
cross-document domain with comparable doc-
uments, joint coreference resolution performs
significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points)
than two strong baselines that resolve entities
and events separately.

1 Introduction

Most coreference resolution systems focus on enti-
ties and tacitly assume a correspondence between
entities and noun phrases (NPs). Focusing on NPs
is a way to restrict the challenging problem of coref-
erence resolution, but misses coreference relations
like the one between hanged and his suicide in (1),
and between placed and put in (2).

1. (a) One of the key suspected Mafia bosses ar-
rested yesterday has hanged himself.

(b) Police said Lo Presti had hanged himself.
(c) His suicide appeared to be related to clan feuds.

2. (a) The New Orleans Saints placed Reggie Bush
on the injured list on Wednesday.

(b) Saints put Bush on I.R.

As (1c) shows, NPs can also refer to events, and
so corefer with phrases other than NPs (Webber,
1988). By being anchored in spatio-temporal dimen-
sions, events represent the most frequent referent of
verbal elements. In addition to time and location,
events are characterized by their participants or ar-
guments, which often correspond with discourse en-
tities. This two-way feedback between events and
their arguments (or entities) is the core of our ap-
proach. Since arguments play a key role in describ-
ing an event, knowing that two arguments corefer
is useful for finding coreference relations between
events, and knowing that two events corefer is use-
ful for finding coreference relations between enti-
ties. In (1), the coreference relation between One
of the key suspected Mafia bosses arrested yesterday
and Lo Presti can be found by knowing that their
predicates (i.e., has hanged and had hanged) core-
fer. On the other hand, the coreference relations be-
tween the arguments Saints and Bush in (2) helps
to determine the coreference relation between their
predicates placed and put.

In this paper, we take a holistic approach to coref-
erence. We annotate a corpus with cross-document
coreference relations for nominal and verbal men-
tions. We focus on both intra and inter-document
coreference because this scenario is at the same time
more challenging and more relevant to real-world
applications such as news aggregation. We use this
corpus to train a model that jointly addresses refer-
ences to both entities and events across documents.
The contributions of this work are the following:

• We introduce a novel approach for entity and
event coreference resolution. At the core of

489



our approach is an iterative algorithm that cau-
tiously constructs clusters of entity and event
mentions using linear regression to model clus-
ter merge operations. Importantly, our model
allows information to flow between clusters of
both types through features that model context
using semantic role dependencies.

• We annotate and release a new corpus with
coreference relations between both entities and
events across documents. The relations anno-
tated are both intra and inter-document, which
more accurately models real-world scenarios.

• We evaluate our cross-document coreference
resolution system on this corpus and show that
our joint approach significantly outperforms
two strong baselines that resolve entities and
events separately.

2 Related Work

Entity coreference resolution is a well studied prob-
lem with many successful techniques for identify-
ing mention clusters (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006;
Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Stoyanov et al., 2009;
Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Raghunathan et al., 2010;
Rahman and Ng, 2011, inter alia). Most of these
techniques focus on matching compatible noun pairs
using various syntactic and semantic features, with
efforts targeted toward improving features and clus-
tering models.

Prior work showed that models that jointly resolve
mentions across multiple entities result in better per-
formance than simply resolving mentions in a pair-
wise fashion (Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Poon and
Domingos, 2008; Wick et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011,
inter alia). A natural extension is to perform coref-
erence jointly across both entities and events. Yet
there has been little attempt in this direction.

We know of only limited work that incorporates
event-related information in entity coreference, typ-
ically by incorporating the verbs in context as fea-
tures. For instance, Haghighi and Klein (2010) in-
clude the governor of the head of nominal mentions
as features in their model. Rahman and Ng (2011)
also used event-related information by looking at
which semantic role the entity mentions can have
and the verb pairs of their predicates. We confirm

that such features are useful but also show that the
complementary features for verbal mentions lead to
even better performance, especially when event and
entity clusters are jointly modeled.

Compared to the extensive work on entity coref-
erence, the related problem of event coreference re-
mains relatively under-explored, with minimal work
on how entity and event coreference can be con-
sidered jointly on an open domain. Early work on
event coreference for MUC (Humphreys et al., 1997;
Bagga and Baldwin, 1999) focused on scenario-
specific events. More recently, there have been
approaches that looked at event coreference for
wider domains. Chen and Ji (2009) proposed us-
ing spectral graph clustering to cluster events. Be-
jan and Harabagiu (2010) proposed a nonparamet-
ric Bayesian model for open-domain event resolu-
tion. However, most of this prior work focused only
on event coreference, whereas we address both en-
tities and events with a single model. Humphreys
et al. (1997) considered entities as well as events,
but due to the lack of a corpus annotated with event
coreference, their approach was only evaluated im-
plicitly in the MUC-6 template filling task. To our
knowledge, the only previous work that considered
entity and event coreference resolution jointly is
He (2007), but limited to the medical domain and
focused on just five semantic categories.

3 Architecture

Following the intuition introduced in Section 1, our
approach iteratively builds clusters of event and en-
tity mentions jointly. As more information becomes
available (e.g., finding out that two verbal mentions
have arguments that belong to the same entity clus-
ter), the features of both entity and event mentions
are re-generated, which prompts future clustering
operations. Our model follows a cautious (or “baby
steps”) approach, which we previously showed to be
successful for entity coreference resolution (Raghu-
nathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011). However,
unlike our previous work, which used deterministic
rules, in this paper we learn a coreference resolution
model using linear regression. Algorithm 1 summa-
rizes the flow of the proposed algorithm. We detail
its steps next. We describe the training procedure in
Section 4 and the features used in Section 5.

3.1 Document Clustering

Our approach starts with several steps that reduce
the search space for the actual coreference resolution
task. The first is document clustering, which clusters
the set of input documents (D) into a set of docu-
ment clusters (C). In the subsequent steps we only
cluster mentions that appear in the same document
cluster. We found this to be very useful in practice
because, in addition to reducing the search space, it
provides a word sense disambiguation mechanism
based on corpus-wide topics. For example, with-
out document clustering, our algorithm may decide
to cluster two mentions of the verb hit, but know-
ing that one belongs to a cluster containing earth-
quake reports and the other to a cluster with reports
on criminal activities, this decision can be avoided.1

Any non-parametric clustering algorithm can be
used in this step. In this paper, we used the algo-
rithm proposed by Surdeanu et al. (2005). This algo-
rithm is an Expectation Maximization (EM) variant
where the initial points (and the number of clusters)
are selected from the clusters generated by a hierar-
chical agglomerative clustering algorithm using ge-

1Since different mentions of the verb say in the same topic
might refer to different events, they are only merged if they have
coreferent arguments.

ometric heuristics. This algorithm performs well on
our data. For example, in the training dataset, only
two topics (handling different earthquake events) are
incorrectly merged into the same cluster.

3.2 Mention Extraction

In this step (4 in Algorithm 1) we extract nominal,
pronominal, and verbal mentions. We extract nom-
inal and pronominal mentions using the mention
identification component in the publicly download-
able Stanford coreference resolution system (Raghu-
nathan et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011). We consider
as verbal mentions all words whose part of speech
starts with VB, with the exception of some auxil-
iary/copulative verbs (have, be and seem). For each
of the identified mentions we build a singleton clus-
ter (step 5 in Algorithm 1).

Crucially, we do not make a formal distinction be-
tween entity and event mentions. This distinction is
not trivial to implement (e.g., is the noun earthquake
an entity or an event mention?) and an imperfect
classification would negatively affect the following
coreference resolution. Instead, we simply classify
mentions into verbal or nominal, and use this dis-
tinction later during feature generation (Section 5).
To compare event nouns (e.g., development) with
verbal mentions, the “derivationally related form”
relation in WordNet is used.

3.3 High-precision Entity Resolution Sieves

To further reduce the problem’s search space, in
step 6 of Algorithm 1 we apply a set of high-
precision filters from the Stanford coreference res-
olution system. This system is a collection of deter-
ministic models (or “sieves”) for entity coreference
resolution that incorporate lexical, syntactic, seman-
tic, and discourse information. These sieves are ap-
plied from higher to lower precision. As clusters are
built, information such as mention gender and num-
ber is propagated across mentions in the same clus-
ter, which helps subsequent decisions. The Stanford
system obtained the highest score at the CoNLL-
2011 shared task on English coreference resolution.

For this step, we selected all the sieves from the
Stanford system with the exception of the pronoun
resolution sieve. All the remaining sieves (listed
in Table 1) have high precision because they em-
ploy linguistic heuristics with little ambiguity, e.g.,

one sieve clusters together two entity mentions only
when they have the same head word. Note that all
these heuristics were designed for within-document
coreference. They work well in our context be-
cause we apply them in individual document clus-
ters, where the one-sense-per-discourse principle
still holds (Yarowsky, 1995).

Importantly, these sieves do not address verbal
mentions. That is, all verbal mentions are still in sin-
gleton clusters after this step. Furthermore, none of
these sieves use features that facilitate the joint reso-
lution of nominal and verbal mentions (e.g., features
from semantic role frames). All these limitations are
addressed next.

3.4 Iterative Entity/Event Resolution

In this stage (steps 7 – 9 in Algorithm 1), we con-
struct entity and event clusters using a cautious or
“baby steps” approach. We use a single linear re-
gressor (Θ) to model cluster merge operations be-
tween both verbal and nominal clusters. Intuitively,
the linear regressor models the quality of the merge
operation, i.e., a score larger than 0.5 indicates that
more than half of the mention pairs introduced by
this merge are correct. We discuss the training pro-
cedure that yields this scoring function in Section 4.
In each iteration, we perform the merge operation
that has the highest score. Once two clusters are
merged (step 9) we regenerate all the mention fea-
tures to reflect the current clusters. We stop when no
merging operation with an overall benefit is found.

This iterative procedure is the core of our joint
coreference resolution approach. This algorithm
transparently merges both entity and event men-
tions and, importantly, allows information to flow
between clusters of both types as merge operations
take place. For example, assume that during iter-
ation i we merge the two hanged verbs in the first

example in Section 1 (because they have the same
lemma). Because of this merge, in iteration i+ 1 the
nominal mentions Lo Presti and One of the key sus-
pected Mafia bosses have the same semantic role for
verbs assigned to the same cluster. This is a strong
hint that these two nominal mentions belong to the
same cluster. Indeed, the feature that models this
structure received one of the highest weights in our
linear regression model (see Section 7).

3.5 Pronoun Sieve
Our approach concludes with the pronominal coref-
erence resolution sieve from the Stanford system.
This sieve is necessary because our current reso-
lution algorithm ignores mention ordering and dis-
tance (i.e., in step 7 we compare all clusters regard-
less of where their mentions appear in the text). As
previous work has proved, the structure of the text is
crucial for pronominal coreference (Hobbs, 1978).
For this reason, we handle pronouns outside of the
main algorithm block.

4 Training the Cluster Merging Model

Two observations drove our choice of model and
training algorithm. First, modeling the merge op-
eration as a classification task is not ideal, because
only a few of the resulting clusters are entirely cor-
rect or incorrect. In practice, most of the clusters
will contain some mention pairs that are correct and
some that are not. Second, generating training data
for the merging model is not trivial: a brute force
approach that looks at all the possible combinations
is exponential in the number of mentions. This is
both impractical and unnecessary, as some of these
combinations are unlikely to be seen in practice.

We address these observations with Algorithm 2.
The algorithm uses gold coreference labels to train a
linear regressor that models the quality of the clus-
ters produced by merge operations. We define the
quality score q of a new cluster as the percentage of
new mention pairs (i.e., not present in either one of
the clusters to be merged) that are correct:

q =
linkscorrect

linkscorrect + linksincorrect
(1)

where links(in)correct is the number of newly intro-
duced (in)correct pairwise mention links when two
clusters are merged.

E = merge(e1, e2, E)14

// train using data from last epoch:
Θ′ = trainLinearRegressor(Γ)15
// interpolate with older model:
Θ = λΘ + (1− λ)Θ′16

output : Θ

We address the potential explosion in training data
size by considering only merge operations that are
likely to be inspected by the algorithm as it runs.
To achieve this, Algorithm 2 repeatedly runs the ac-
tual clustering algorithm (as given by the current
model Θ) over the training dataset (steps 5 – 14).2

When the algorithm iteratively constructs its clus-
ters (steps 9 – 14), we generate training data from
all possible cluster pairs available during a particular
iteration (steps 10 – 12). For each pair, we compute
its score using Equation 1 (step 11) and add it to the
training corpus Γ (step 12). Note that this avoids in-
specting many of the possible cluster combinations:
once a cluster is built (e.g., during the previous iter-
ations or by the deterministic sieves in step 8), we
do not generate training data from its members, but
rather treat it as an atomic unit. On the other hand,
our approach generates more training data than on-
line learning, which trains using only the actual de-
cisions taken during inference in each iteration (i.e.,

2We skip the pronoun sieve here because it does not affect
the decisions taken during the iterative resolution steps.

the pair (e1, e2) in step 13).
After each epoch we have a new training cor-

pus Γ, which we use to train the new linear regres-
sion model Θ’ (step 15), which is then interpolated
with the old one (step 16).

Our training procedure is similar in spirit to trans-
formation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995). Sim-
ilarly to TBL, our approach repeatedly applies the
model over the training data and attempts to mini-
mize the error rate of the current model. However,
while TBL learns rules that directly minimize the
current error rate, our approach achieves this indi-
rectly, by incorporating the reduction in error rate in
the score of the generated datums. This allows us
to fit a linear regression to this task, which, as dis-
cussed before, is a better model for this task.

Just like any hill-climbing algorithm, our ap-
proach has the risk of converging to a local max-
imum. To mitigate this risk, we do not initialize
our model Θ with random weights, but rather use
hints from the deterministic sieves. This procedure
(listed in step 2) runs the high-precision sieves in-
troduced in Section 3.3 and, just like the data gen-
eration loop in Algorithm 2, creates training exam-
ples from the clusters available after every merge
operation. Since these deterministic models address
only nominal clusters, at the end we generate train-
ing data for events by inspecting all the pairs of sin-
gleton verbal clusters. Using this data, we train the
initial linear regression model.

We trained our model using L2 regularized linear
regression with a regularization coefficient of 1.0.
We did not tune the regularization coefficient. We
ran the training algorithm for 10 epochs, although
we observed minimal changes after three epochs.
We tuned the interpolation weight (λ) to a value
of 0.7 using our development corpus.

5 Features

We list in Table 2 the features used by the lin-
ear regression model. As the table indicates, our
feature set relies heavily on semantic roles, which
were extracted using the SwiRL semantic role la-
beling (SRL) system (Surdeanu et al., 2007).3 Be-
cause SwiRL addresses only verbal predicates, we
extended it to handle nominal predicates. In this

Feature Name
Applies to
Entities (E)
or Events (V)

Description and Example

Entity Heads E

Cosine similarity of the head-word vectors of two clusters. The head-word vector
stores the head words of all mentions in a cluster and their frequencies. For example,
the vector for the three-mention cluster {Barack Obama, President Obama, US
president}, is {Obama:2, president:1}.

Event Lemmas V
Cosine similarity of the lemma vectors of two clusters. For example, the lemma
vector for the cluster {murdered, murders, hitting} is {murder:2, hit:1}.

Links between
Synonyms E, V

The percentage of newly-introduced mention links after the merge that are WordNet
synonyms (Fellbaum, 1998). For example, when merging the following two clus-
ters, {hit, strike} and {strike, join, say}, two out of the six new links are between
words that belong to the same WordNet synset: (hit – strike) and (strike – strike).

Number of Coreferent
Arguments or
Predicates

E, V

The total number of shared arguments and predicates between mentions in the
two clusters. We use the cluster IDs of the corresponding arguments/predicates
to check for identity. For example, when comparing the event clusters {bought}
and {acquired}, extracted from the sentences [AMD]Arg0 bought [ATI]Arg1 and
[AMD]Arg0 acquired [ATI]Arg1, the value of this feature is 2 because the two men-
tions share one Arg0 and one Arg1 argument (assuming that the clusters {AMD,
AMD} and {ATI, ATI} were previously created). For entity clusters, this feature
counts the number of coreferent predicates. In addition to PropBank-style roles, for
event mentions we also include the closest left and right entity mentions in order to
capture any arguments missed by the SRL system.

Coreferent Arguments
in a Specific Role? E, V

Indicator feature set to 1 if the two clusters have at least one coreferent argument in
a given role. We generate one variant of this feature for each argument label, e.g.,
Arg0, Arg1, etc. For example, the value of this feature for Arg0 for the clusters
{bought} and {acquired} in the above example is 1.

Coreferent Predicate in
a Specific Role? E

Indicator feature set to 1 if the two clusters have at least one coreferent predicate for
a given role. For example, for the clusters {the man} and {the person}, extracted
from the sentences helped [the man]Arg1 and helped [the person]Arg1, the value of
this feature is 1 if the two helped verbs were previously clustered together.

2nd Order Similarity of
Mention Words

E

Cosine similarity of vectors containing words that are distributionally similar to
words in the cluster mentions. We built these vectors by extracting the top-ten
most-similar words in Dekang Lin’s similarity thesaurus (Lin, 1998) for all the
nouns/adjectives/verbs in a cluster. For example, for the singleton cluster {a new
home}, we construct this vector by expanding new and home to: {new:1, original:1,
old:1, existing:1, current:1, unique:1, modern:1, different:1, special:1, major:1,
small:1, home:1, house:1, apartment:1, building:1, hotel:1, residence:1, office:1,
mansion:1, school:1, restaurant:1, hospital:1 }.

Number; Animacy;
Gender; NE Label

E
Cosine similarity of number, gender, animacy, and NE label vectors. For example,
the number and gender vectors for the two-mention cluster {systems, a pen} are
Number = {singular:1, plural:1}, Gender = {neutral:2}.

Table 2: List of features used when comparing two clusters. If any of the two clusters contains a verbal mention we
consider the merge an operation between event (V) clusters; otherwise it is a merge between entity (E) clusters. We
append to all entity features the suffix Proper or Common based on the type of the head word of the first mention in
each of the two clusters. We use the suffix Proper only if both head words are proper nouns.

paper we used a single heuristic: the possessor of
a nominal event’s predicate is marked as its Arg0,

e.g., Logan is the Arg0 to run in Logan’s run.4

4A principled solution to this problem is to use an SRL sys-
tem for nominal predicates trained using NomBank (Meyers et
al., 2004). We will address this in future work.

We extracted named entity labels using the named
entity recognizer from the Stanford CoreNLP suite.

6.1 Corpus

The training and test data sets were derived from
the EventCorefBank (ECB) corpus5 created by Be-
jan and Harabagiu (2010) to study event coreference
since standard corpora such as OntoNotes (Pradhan
et al., 2007) contain a small number of annotated
event clusters. The ECB corpus consists of 482 doc-
uments from Google News clustered into 43 topics,
where a topic is described as a seminal event. The
reason for including comparable documents was to
increase the number of cross-document coreference
relations. Bejan and Harabagiu (2010) only anno-
tated a selection of events.

For the purpose of our study, we extended the
original corpus in two directions: (i) fully anno-
tated sentences, and (ii) entity coreference relations.
In addition, we removed relations other than coref-
erence (e.g., subevent, purpose, related, etc.) that
had been originally annotated. We revised and com-
pleted the original annotation by annotating every
entity and event in the sentences that were (partially)
annotated. The annotation was performed by four
experts, using the Callisto annotation tool.6 The
annotation guidelines and the generated corpus are
available here.7

Our annotation of the ECB corpus followed the
OntoNotes (Pradhan et al., 2007) standard for coref-
erence annotation, with a few extensions to handle
events. For nouns, we annotated full NPs (with all
modifiers), excluding appositive phrases and nomi-
nal predicates. Only premodifiers that were proper
nouns or possessive phrases were annotated. For
events, we annotated the semantic head of the verb
phrase. We extended the OntoNotes guidelines by
also annotating singletons (but we do not score
them; see below), and by including all events men-
tions (not only those mentioned at least once with an
NP). This required us to be specific with respect to:

Figure 1: Annotation example.

Light verbs Verbs such as give and make followed
by a noun (e.g., make an offer) were not anno-
tated, but the noun was.

Phrasal verbs We annotated the verb together with
the preposition or adverb (e.g., check in).

Idioms They were annotated with all their elements
(e.g., booze it up).

The first topic was annotated by all four anno-
tators as burn-in. Afterwards, annotation disagree-
ments were resolved between all annotators and the
next three topics were annotated again by all four an-
notators to measure agreement. Following Passon-
neau (2004), we computed an inter-annotator agree-
ment of α = 0.55 (Krippendorff, 2004) on these
three topics, indicating moderate agreement among
the annotators. Given the complexity of the task, we
consider this to be a good score. For example, the
average of the CoNLL F1 between any two annota-
tors is 73.58, which is much higher than the system
scores reported in the literature.

After annotating the four topics, disagreements
were resolved again and all the documents in the
four topics were corrected to match the consensus.
The rest of the corpus was split between the four an-
notators, and each document was annotated by a sin-
gle annotator. Figure 1 shows an example. Table 3
shows the corpus statistics, including the training,
development (dev) and test set splits. The dev topics
were used for tuning the interpolation parameter λ
from Section 4.

Table 4: Performance of the two baselines and our model. We report scores for entity clusters, event clusters and the
complete task using five metrics.

6.2 Evaluation

We use five coreference evaluation metrics widely
used in the literature:

MUC (Vilain et al., 1995) Link-based metric which
measures how many predicted and gold clus-
ters need to be merged to cover the gold and
predicted clusters, respectively.

B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) Mention-based
metric which measures the proportion of over-
lap between predicted and gold clusters for a
given mention.

CEAF (Luo, 2005) Entity-based metric that, unlike
B3, enforces a one-to-one alignment between
gold and predicted clusters. We employ the
entity-based version of CEAF.

BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, 2011) Metric based
on the Rand index (Rand, 1971) that consid-
ers both coreference and non-coreference links
to address the imbalance between singleton and
coreferent mentions.

CoNLL F1 Average of MUC, B3, and CEAF-φ4.
This was the official metric in the CoNLL-2011
shared task (Pradhan et al., 2011).

We followed the CoNLL-2011 evaluation methodol-
ogy, that is, we removed all singleton clusters, and
apposition/copular relations before scoring.

We evaluated the systems on three different set-
tings: only on entity clusters, only on event clus-
ters, and on the complete task, i.e., both entities and
events. Note that the gold corpus separates clusters
into entity and event clusters (see Table 3), but our

system does not make this distinction at runtime.
In order to compute the entity-only and event-only
scores in Table 4, we implemented the following
procedure: (a) when scoring entity clusters, we re-
moved all mentions that were found to be coreferent
with at least one gold event mention and not coref-
erent with any gold entity mentions; and (b) we per-
formed the opposite action when scoring event clus-
ters. This procedure is necessary because our men-
tion identification component is not perfect, i.e., it
generates mentions that do not exist in the gold an-
notation. Furthermore, this procedure is conserva-
tive with respect to the clustering errors of our sys-
tem, e.g., all spurious mentions that our system in-
cludes in a cluster with a gold entity mention are
considered for the entity score, regardless of their
gold type (event or entity).

6.3 Results

Table 4 compares the performance of our system
against two strong baselines that resolve entities and
events separately. Baseline 1 uses a modified Stan-
ford coreference resolution system after our doc-
ument clustering and mention identification steps.
Because the original Stanford system implements
only entity coreference, we extended it with an extra
sieve that implements lemma matching for events.
This additional sieve merges two verbal clusters
(i.e., clusters that contain at least one verbal men-
tion) or a verbal and a nominal cluster when at least
two lemmas of mention head words are the same be-
tween clusters, e.g., helped and the help.

The second baseline adds two more sieves to
Baseline 1. Both these sieves model entity and event

contextual information using semantic roles. The
first sieve merges two nominal clusters when two
mentions in the respective clusters have the same
head words and two mentions (possibly with dif-
ferent heads) modify with the same role label two
predicates that have the same lemma. For exam-
ple, this sieve merges the clusters {Obama, the pres-
ident} (seen in the text [Obama]Arg0 attended and
[the president]Arg1 was elected) and {Obama} (seen
in the text [Obama]Arg1 was elected), because they
share a mention with the same head word (Obama)
and two mentions modify with the same role (Arg1)
predicates with the same lemma (elect). The sec-
ond sieve implements the complementary action for
event clusters. That is, it merges two verbal clusters
when at least two mentions have the same lemma
and at least two mentions have semantic arguments
with the same role label and the same lemma.

7 Discussion

The first block in Table 4 indicates that lemma
matching is a strong baseline for event resolution.
Most of the event scores for Baseline 1 are actually
higher than the corresponding entity scores, which
were obtained using the highest ranked system at the
CoNLL-2011 shared task (Lee et al., 2011). Adding
contextual information using semantic roles (Base-
line 2) helps both entities and events. The CoNLL
F1 for Baseline 2 increases almost 3 points for enti-
ties and 1 point for events. This demonstrates that
local syntactico-semantic context is important for
coreference resolution even in a cross-document set-
ting and that the current state-of-the-art in SRL can
model this context accurately.

The best scores (almost unanimously) are ob-
tained by the model proposed in this paper, which
scores 3.4 CoNLL F1 points higher than Baseline 2
for entities, and 2.6 points higher for events. For the
complete task, our approach scores 3.3 CoNLL F1
points higher than Baseline 2, and 6.1 points higher
than Baseline 1. This demonstrates that a holistic
approach to coreference resolution improves the res-
olution of both entities and events more than models
that address aspects of the task separately. To fur-
ther understand our experiments, we listed the top
five entity/event features with the highest weights in
our model in Table 5. The table indicates that six out
of the ten features serve the purpose of passing infor-

Entity Feature Weight

Coreferent Predicate for ArgM-LOC – Common 0.45

Entity Heads – Common 0.36
Coreferent Predicate for Arg0 – Proper 0.29

Coreferent Predicate for Arg2 – Common 0.28

Event Feature Weight

mation between entity and event clusters. For exam-
ple, the “Coreferent Argument for Arg1” feature is
triggered when two event clusters have Arg1 argu-
ments that already belong to the same entity cluster.
This allows information from previous entity coref-
erence operations to impact future merges of event
clusters. This is the crux of our iterative approach to
joint coreference resolution.

Finally, we performed an error analysis by man-
ually evaluating 100 errors. We distinguished nine
major types of errors. Their ratios together with a
description and an example are given in Table 6.

This work demonstrates that an approach that
jointly models entities and events is better for cross-
document coreference resolution. However, our
model can be improved. For example, document
clustering and coreference resolution can be solved
jointly, which we expect would improve both tasks.
Furthermore, our iterative coreference resolution
procedure (Algorithm 1) could be modified to ac-
count for mention ordering and distance, which
would allow us to include pronominal resolution in
our joint model, rather than addressing it with a sep-
arate deterministic sieve.

8 Conclusion

We have presented a holistic model for cross-
document coreference resolution that jointly solves
references to events and entities by handling both
nominal and verbal mentions. Our joint resolution
algorithm allows event coreference to help improve
entity coreference, and vice versa. In addition, our
iterative procedure, based on a linear regressor that
models the quality of cluster merges, allows each

Error Type (Ratio)
Description
Example

Pronoun resolution
(36%)

The pronoun is incorrectly resolved by the pronominal sieve of the Stanford deterministic entity
system. These errors include (only a small number of) event pronouns.
He said Timmons aimed and missed his target.

Semantics beyond
role frames
(20%)

The semantics of the coreference relation cannot be captured by role frames or WordNet.
Israeli forces on Tuesday killed at least 40 people . . . The Israeli army said the UN school in the
Jabaliya refugee camp was hit . . . and that the dead included a number of Hamas militants.

Arguments of
nominal events
(17%)

The arguments of two nominal events are not detected and thus not coreferred.
The attack on the school has caused widespread shock across Israel . . . while Israeli forces on
Tuesday killed at least 40 people during an attack on a United Nations-run school in Gaza.

Cascaded errors
(7%)

Entities or events are not coreferred due to errors in a previous merge iteration in the same
semantic frame. In the example below, we failed to link the two die verbs, which leads to the
listed entity error.
An Australian climber who survived two nights stuck on Mount Cook after seeing his brother
die . . . Dr Mark Vinar, 43, is presumed dead . . .

Initial high-precision
sieves
(6%)

An error made by the initial high-precision entity resolution sieves is propagated to our model.
Timmons told police he fired when he thought he saw someone in the other group reach for
a gun . . . 15-year-old Timmons was at the scene of the shooting and had a gun.

Phrasal verbs
(6%)

The meaning of a phrasal verb is not captured.
A relative unknown will take over the title role of Doctor Who . . . But the casting of Smith is
a stroke of genius.

Linear regression
(4%)

Recall error made by the regression model when the features are otherwise correct.
The Interior Department on Thursday issued “revised” regulations . . . Interior Secretary Dirk
Kempthorne announced major changes . . .

Mention detection
(3%)

The mention detection module detects a spurious mention.
Police have arrested a man . . . in the parking lot crosswalk at Sam’s Club in Bloomington.

SRL
(1%)

The SRL system fails to label the semantic role. In this example, jail is detected as the ArgM-
MNR of hanged instead of ArgM-LOC.
A Mafia boss in Palermo hanged himself in jail.

merging state to benefit from the previous merged
entity and event mentions. This approach allows us
to start with a set of high-precision coreference rela-
tions and gradually add new ones to increase recall.

The experimental evaluation shows that our coref-
erence algorithm gives markedly better F1 for both
entities and events, outperforming two strong base-
lines that handle entities and events separately, mea-
sured by all the standard measures: MUC, B3,
CEAF-φ4, BLANC and the official CoNLL-2011
metric. This is noteworthy since each measure has
been shown to place primary emphasis in evaluating
a different aspect of the coreference resolution task.

Our system is tailored for cross-document coref-
erence resolution on a corpus that contains news ar-
ticles that repeatedly report on a smaller number of
topics. This makes it particularly suitable for real-

world applications such as multi-document summa-
rization and cross-document information extraction.
We also release our labeled corpus to facilitate ex-
tensions and comparisons to our work.
