Abstract

Sentiment analysis has been a major area
of interest, for which the existence of high-
quality resources is crucial. In Arabic,
there is a reasonable number of sentiment
lexicons but with major deficiencies. The
paper presents a large-scale Standard Ara-
bic Sentiment Lexicon (SLSA) that is pub-
licly available for free and avoids the de-
ficiencies in the current resources. SLSA
has the highest up-to-date reported cover-
age. The construction of SLSA is based on
linking the lexicon of AraMorph with Sen-
tiWordNet along with a few heuristics and
powerful back-off. SLSA shows a relative
improvement of 37.8% over a state-of-the-
art lexicon when tested for accuracy. It
also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5% of
F1-score when tested for sentiment analy-
sis.

1 Introduction

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying
and extracting subjective information using Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP). It helps identi-
fying opinions and extracting relevant information
that lies behind the analyzed data. Sentiment anal-
ysis has received enormous interest in NLP, and
in particular in the context of web content. This
includes social media, blogs, discussions, reviews
and advertisement.

While there has been extensive work on senti-
ment analysis in English and other languages of
interest, less work has been done for Arabic. A
major concern in Arabic NLP is the morphological
complexity of the language along with the limited
number of resources, corpora in particular.

The goal of this work is to build a publicly
available large-scale Sentiment Lexicon for Stan-
dard Arabic (SLSA). For every lemma and part-
of-speech (POS) combination that exists in a large
Standard Arabic lexicon, SLSA assigns the scores
of three sentiment labels: positive, negative and
objective, in addition to the English gloss. The

positive and negative scores range between zero
and one, while the objective score is defined as 1 -
(positive score + negative score).

The existence of SLSA is valuable to the field
of Arabic sentiment analysis, which is expected
to receive considerable focus during the current
decade. SLSA is the first sentiment lexicon for
Arabic to combine the following four strengths.
High coverage SLSA lists the sentiment of about
35,000 lemma and POS combinations, which is
the highest coverage reported for Standard Arabic
sentiment lexicons.
High quality Unlike many of the current lexicons
whose construction is based on semi-supervised
learning and heuristic-based approaches, SLSA
is not constructed via machine learning models,
while the use of heuristics is minimal.
Richness As opposed to sparse surface-based lex-
icons, SLSA is a lemma-based resource that at-
taches POS and English gloss information to each
lemma, where the information of a lemma is appli-
cable to its inflected forms. This makes the lexicon
more useful when used by other research.
Public Availability SLSA is based on free re-
sources and is publicly available for free.1

2 Related Work

Work on building Arabic sentiment lexicons
mainly falls into two categories: 1) linking an Ara-
bic sentiment lexicon with an English one, and 2)
applying semi-supervised or supervised learning
techniques on Arabic resources. We summarize
these two types in turn.

We start with a survey of work based on trans-
lation, which our work falls into as well. The
most similar work to the one presented in this
paper is ArSenL (Badaro et al., 2014). ArSenL
is considered the first publicly available large-
scale Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon. It was
constructed using a combination of SentiWordNet
(Baccianella et al., 2010), Arabic WordNet (Black
et al., 2006) and SAMA (Graff et al., 2009). Ar-

1The lexicon is available at http://volta.ldeo.

SenL outperforms the state-of-the-art Arabic sen-
timent lexicons. However, we show that SLSA
has better coverage and quality. Moreover, Ar-
SenL uses SAMA which is not publicly available
for free, as opposed to SLSA which is based on
free resources.

Another similar work to ArSenL is the resource
developed by Alhazmi et al. (2013). They linked
the Arabic WordNet to SentiWordNet via the pro-
vided synset offset information. However, the con-
structed lexicon has a limited coverage of nearly
10K lemmas, which makes it not very useful for
further applications.

Abdul-Mageed and Diab (2014) presented
SANA, a subjectivity and sentiment lexicon for
Arabic. The lexicon combines pre-existing lexi-
cons and involves automatic machine translation,
manual annotations and gloss matching across
several resources such as THARWA (Diab et al.,
2014) and SAMA. SANA includes about 225K
entries, where many of them are duplicates, in-
flected or not diacritized, which makes the re-
source noisy and less useable. Additionally, the
automatic translation does not utilize the POS in-
formation, which affects the quality of the re-
source.

Other work that follows the translation ap-
proach includes the one presented by El-Halees
(2011) where SentiStrength (Thelwall et al., 2010)
was translated using a dictionary along with man-
ual correction. Another instance is SIFAAT
(Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2012), an earlier ver-
sion of SANA but with more reliance on transla-
tion. Another lexicon was built by Elarnaoty et al.
(2012) who manually translated the MPQA lex-
icon (Wilson et al., 2005). The common aspect
among those resources is the lack of adequate cov-
erage and quality.

Mobarz et al. (2011) created a sentiment Ara-
bic lexical Semantic Database (SentiRDI) by us-
ing a dictionary-based approach. The database has
many inflected forms, i.e., it is not lemma-based.
Moreover, the authors reported insufficient quality
and plan to try other alternatives.

We now turn to work based entirely on Arabic
resources. Mahyoub et al. (2014) created an Ara-
bic sentiment lexicon that assigns sentiment scores
to the words in Arabic WordNet using a lexicon-
based approach. The lexicon was initially based
on a few words and then expanded by exploit-
ing synset relations in a semi-supervised learning
manner. However, the lexicon is limited to about
23k lemmas and is not publicly available.

Another Arabic sentiment lexicon was created
by Elhawary and Elfeky (2010). The lexicon was
built using a similarity graph where the edges have

similarity scores. A major drawback is the low
coverage of the lexicon. Moreover, expanding the
graph requires a huge corpus with polarity and se-
mantic annotations and adds more sparsity.

3 Approach
Following the example of ArSenL (Badaro et al.,
2014), SLSA is constructed by linking the lexicon
of an Arabic morphological analyzer with Senti-
WordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010). Unlike Ar-
SenL, SLSA uses AraMorph (Buckwalter, 2004),
a morphological analyzer for Standard Arabic. An
AraMorph entry represents a morpheme and con-
tains the surface, lemma, part of speech (POS),
and gloss information. The gloss information
consists of a list of gloss terms, each of which
contains one or more words (such as “time limit
/ end”). On the other side, SentiWordNet is a
large-scale sentiment lexicon for English that as-
signs sentiment scores (positive, negative and ob-
jective) to the synsets in English WordNet (Miller
et al., 1990) along with the POS and gloss infor-
mation. Upon linking the two resources, the sen-
timent scores in SentiWordNet are applied to the
entries of AraMorph to construct SLSA. The ques-
tion this paper addresses is how to link these two
resources, and we present a new linking algorithm
compared to that used by ArSenL, with improved
performance.

3.1 Preparing the Resources
It might seem intuitive to join the entries of
AraMorph and SentiWordNet based on their
glosses, but this does not work as expected.
AraMorph and SentiWordNet were developed for
different reasons and have different gloss struc-
tures (synonyms in AraMorph versus detailed de-
scriptions in SentiWordNet). Mapping the glosses
is one of the major bottlenecks in ArSenL, which
is not able to find a match for 24% of the en-
tries in SAMA. Instead, we link the two resources
by relating the glosses of AraMorph to the synset
terms in SentiWordNet. Additionally, we take
POS into consideration as the glosses and synset
terms might not be enough to disambiguate an en-
try. Next, we discuss the preparation steps that al-
low for the linking of the resources.

Cleaning-up AraMorph Some POS and
lemma decisions in AraMorph are erroneous or
not optimal. For example, some entries are as-
signed wrong POS tags, such as the NO FUNC
cases, or have inconsistent spellings of the lem-
mas. Also, some adverbs are redundant as they
have the same lemma as an adjective. Accord-
ingly, we cleaned up AraMorph in a way that al-
lows for a better linking with SentiWordNet. The

2546



cleaned-up AraMorph is closer to SAMA (used
in ArSenL), which is itself a modified version
of AraMorph. Practically, SAMA can replace
AraMorph. However, the integration of AraMorph
allows the lexicon to be publicly available for free,
which SAMA prohibits.

Gloss Normalization Since the entries in
AraMorph are bound to stems, the English glosses
are inflected for number. As a result, we lem-
matize the English glosses in AraMorph in or-
der to be able to match to the synset terms in
SentiWordNet. The lemmatization is done using
Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing
Toolkit (Manning et al., 2014). Additionally, we
remove from the glosses any descriptive text be-
tween parentheses, as well as the stop words be,
a, an and the (unless be is the actual lemma of the
AraMorph gloss). Moreover, if any of the lemma-
tized words in an AraMorph gloss does not match
any of the synset terms in SentiWordNet and has
a regular morphological derivation, the effect of
the derivation is removed if the removal results in
an existing synset term, e.g., voluntariness is con-
verted to voluntary and orientalization becomes
orientalize. We created the list of the deriva-
tional patterns manually by examining AraMorph
glosses.

POS Mapping AraMorph has a rich POS
tagset, while SentiWordNet has only four tags
corresponding to nouns, adjectives, adverbs and
verbs. Accordingly, AraMorph POS tags are
mapped to the four tags in SentiWordNet. Some
AraMorph POS types, such as particles, pronouns
and prepositions, do not map to any SentiWord-
Net tags, and we exclude them as they have zero
polarity scores, by definition.

AraMorph Rearrangement We collapse all
the entries in AraMorph that have the same
(lemma, POS) pair, and the English glosses
become the union of the normalized glosses
before the collapse. For example, a lemma
might appear in two entries with two POS tags;
VERB PERFECT and VERB IMPERFECT . Af-
ter the preparation, the POS tags in both entries
become the same (VERB), and the two entries col-
lapse into one entry whose gloss is the union of the
lemmatized past-tense and present-tense glosses.
Figure 1 shows a sample of AraMorph before and
after the preparation process (the Arabic translit-
eration is in the Buckwalter scheme (Buckwalter,
2004)).

SentiWordNet Rearrangement We extract all
the unique combinations of synset terms and POS
tags in SentiWordNet, while the indices of the
synset terms are stripped off. However, since a
synset term might appear in different synsets un-

timent scores, the sentiment scores of an extracted

average of the scores in the contributing ones.

3.2 Linking the Resources
We start out by creating a link between an
AraMorph entry and a SentiWordNet entry if any
of the AraMorph one-word gloss terms and the
POS match the SentiWordNet. Upon linking, we
assign the AraMorph entry the sentiment scores of
the matching one in SentiWordNet. The linking
condition above applies successfully to 83.6% of
the entries in AraMorph. If the condition does
not apply, we relax it to allow for a more le-
nient POS agreement where NOUN and ADJ POS
tags are used interchangeably, while the VERB
entries in AraMorph become matchable with the
ADJ ones in SentiWordNet. The reasons be-
hind the decisions above are that AraMorph has
hundreds of cases where the same lemma ap-
pears as NOUN and ADJ, while it is frequent that
AraMorph assigns an adjectival gloss (preceded

2547



by be) to VERB entries. The relaxed condition
enables linking an additional 6.7% of AraMorph
entries. If the relaxed condition is still not appli-
cable for an AraMorph entry, the linking condi-
tion becomes more lenient by completely ignoring
the POS agreement. The sentiment scores in that
case become the average of the sentiment scores of
the corresponding synset term across all the POS
types. The latter condition allows matching addi-
tional 0.6% of AraMorph entries.

It might happen that none of the one-word gloss
terms matches a synset term, or the gloss does not
have any one-word gloss terms. In such a case,
we consider multi-word gloss terms. We first re-
move the stop words, and then we test the relaxed
condition on each word separately, starting with
the shortest terms first. The process succeeds if a
match could be established for all the words in a
gloss term, and the sentiment scores become the
average sentiment scores of the matching synset
terms. The relaxed condition on multi-word terms
solves additional 7.9% of the cases. Finally, if no
match could be established across all the differ-
ent gloss terms (1.2% of the entries), default neu-
tral sentiment scores are assigned. The analysis of
such cases is discussed in section 4.

Sometimes, a multi-word gloss term consists of
words that denote excess (e.g., most and more),
scarcity (e.g., less and few) or negation (e.g., not).
We do not match such words to synset terms. In-
stead, they affect the polarity scores; we double
the score, halve the score and swap the sign, re-
spectively. We created the list of such words man-
ually by examining AraMorph glosses.

Figure 3 illustrates the linking process between
a sample of the processed AraMorph with a sam-
ple of the processed SentiWordNet, resulting in
the construction of SLSA. The final SLSA lexicon
consists of 34,821 entries. The counts of the dif-
ferent POS tags in SLSA along with the percent-
ages of the different sentiment classes are reported
in Table 1, while examples from the final lexicon
are listed in Table 2.

4 Evaluation

4.1 Intrinsic Evaluation
As mentioned in section 3, no match could be es-
tablished for 1.2% of AraMorph entries. We man-
ually investigate these cases more closely. About
75% of the entries that are not covered in SLSA
have lemmas that express Arabic or Islamic sub-
jects that do not have English counterparts such as
hamozap (an Arabic name) and kunAfap (an Ara-
bic food). Another 5% of the cases are countries
or nationalities that are not listed in SentiWord-
Net such as EAjiy (Ivorian). Additional 2% of the
cases are due to misspelled or non-English glosses
in AraMorph such as bon appetit. The remaining
cases (around 18%) have glosses that do not match
any of the synset terms in SentiWordNet.

We then conduct an intrinsic evaluation of
SLSA where the performance is compared to that
of ArSenL, which is the most similar state-of-the-
art lexicon (see Section 2). First, we randomly
select 400 (lemma, POS) pairs for the evaluation.
Only four pairs (1%) are not covered in SLSA. On
the other side, 103 pairs (26%) are absent in Ar-
SenL, which is consistent with the claim of the
authors of ArSenL that only 76% of SAMA en-
tries are matched in SentiWordNet. We then eval-
uate the random entries that exist in both SLSA
and ArSenL (297 entries). We ask human anno-

2548



tators to judge the correctness of the values in the
two lexicons. ArSenL may have several sentiment
values for the same entry, each with its own confi-
dence score, so we used the sentiment values with
the highest confidence score (averaged in the case
of multiple answers). Since judging the values as
real numbers is hard for humans, we map the senti-
ment scores into three classes of intensity (zero, up
to 0.55 and above 0.55). An entry is correct only
if the values of the positive and negative polarity
classes are both correct. Each entry was judged
by two annotators (without knowing its origin).
They had to discuss and come to an agreement
in the cases of disagreement (about 15% of the
cases). SLSA and ArSenL have the exact same
scores in 58.2% of the cases, which increases to
83.5% when mapping to the intensity classes.

Table 3 lists the accuracy of a majority baseline
(neutral), SLSA and ArSenL for the different POS
types2. SLSA gives error reductions of 58.7% and
37.8% over the baseline and ArSenL, respectively.

About 93% of SLSA errors are cases where the
sentiment scores are doubtful in SentiWordNet,
while the other errors are due to incorrect glosses
in AraMorph. It might happen that an AraMorph
entry is incorrectly linked to a SentiWordNet entry
causing an error, but we do not see this in any of
the manually analyzed data.

NOUN 183 57.4 71.6 81.4

ADJ 50 42.0 66.0 74.0

All 293 51.9 68.0 80.1

Table 3: Accuracy results of a majority baseline (neutral),
SLSA and ArSenL, evaluated on a test set that is covered in
both SLSA and ArSenL

4.2 Extrinsic Evaluation

We conduct an extrinsic evaluation of SLSA on
the task of sentiment analysis where a subjective
sentence is classified to be either positive or nega-
tive. The performance is compared to that of Ar-
SenL. We use an evaluation setup similar to the
one described in (Badaro et al., 2014) using the
corpus developed by Abdul-Mageed et al. (2011).
The corpus involves 400 documents from the Penn
Arabic Treebank (part 1 version 3) (Maamouri
et al., 2004) where the sentences are tagged as
objective, subjective-positive, subjective-negative
and subjective-neutral. The evaluation only in-
volves the sentences tagged as subjective-positive

2There are only few adverbs in the test set because they
are rare in Arabic, where only 0.1% of the lexicon entries are
adverbs.

and subjective-negative. Random 80% of the sen-
tences are used for training, while the rest are left
for testing.

We train a Support Vector Machines classifier,
through LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), using
sentence vectors of three features representing the
averages of the positive scores, negative scores
and objective scores of the non-stop words in the
sentence divided by the count of the underlying
words. The scores are obtained by querying the
lexicon using the lemma and POS information.

We optimize the classification to obtain the
best F1-score based on five-fold cross validation
on the training set using different SVM kernels
and parameters. Polynomial kernels give the
best weighted-average F1-score3 of 68.6% (us-
ing SLSA), which is an absolute 0.2% improve-
ment over linear kernels. Table 3 lists the preci-
sion, recall and F1-score of a majority baseline
(subjective-negative), SLSA and ArSenL. SLSA
provides absolute weighted-average F1-score im-
provements of 22.9% and 3.5% over the baseline
and ArSenL, respectively.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a publicly available large-scale
Standard Arabic Sentiment Lexicon (SLSA) that
avoids the deficiencies in the current lexicons. The
construction of SLSA is based on linking the lex-
icon of AraMorph with SentiWordNet along with
a few heuristics and powerful back-off. SLSA has
the highest up-to-date reported coverage. SLSA
shows a relative improvement of 37.8% over a
state-of-the-art lexicon when tested for accuracy.
It also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5% of F1-
score when tested for sentiment analysis.

The future plans include manually correcting
SLSA to reach a nearly 100% accuracy. Addi-
tionally, the work will be extended to the Arabic
dialects for which AraMorph-like morphological
analyzers are available. We also plan to study the
cases where English and Arabic translations have
different sentiments due to cultural differences.

3The weighted-average F1-score is the sum of the F-1
score of the positive class and the F1-score of the negative
class, each multiplied by its percentage.
