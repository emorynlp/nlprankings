Abstract

This paper describes the joint QUAERO sub-
mission to the WMT 2011 machine transla-
tion evaluation. Four groups (RWTH Aachen
University, Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy, LIMSI-CNRS, and SYSTRAN) of the
QUAERO project submitted a joint translation
for the WMT German→English task. Each
group translated the data sets with their own
systems. Then RWTH system combination
combines these translations to a better one. In
this paper, we describe the single systems of
each group. Before we present the results of
the system combination, we give a short de-
scription of the RWTH Aachen system com-
bination approach.

1 Overview

QUAERO is a European research and develop-
ment program with the goal of developing multi-
media and multilingual indexing and management
tools for professional and general public applica-
tions (http://www.quaero.org). Research in machine
translation is mainly assigned to the four groups
participating in this joint submission. The aim of
this WMT submission was to show the quality of a
joint translation by combining the knowledge of the
four project partners. Each group develop and main-
tain their own different machine translation system.
These single systems differ not only in their general
approach, but also in the preprocessing of training
and test data. To take the advantage of these dif-
ferences of each translation system, we combined
all hypotheses of the different systems, using the
RWTH system combination approach.

1.1 Data Sets

For WMT 2011 each QUAERO partner trained their
systems on the parallel Europarl and News Com-
mentary corpora. All single systems were tuned on
the newstest2009 dev set. The newstest2008 dev set
was used to train the system combination parame-
ters. Finally the newstest2010 dev set was used to
compare the results of the different system combi-
nation approaches and settings.

2 Translation Systems

2.1 RWTH Aachen Single Systems

For the WMT 2011 evaluation the RWTH utilized
RWTH’s state-of-the-art phrase-based and hierar-
chical translation systems. GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003) was employed to train word alignments, lan-
guage models have been created with the SRILM
toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).

2.1.1 Phrase-Based System

The phrase-based translation (PBT) system is
similar to the one described in Zens and Ney (2008).
After phrase pair extraction from the word-aligned
bilingual corpus, the translation probabilities are es-
timated by relative frequencies. The standard feature
set also includes an n-gram language model, phrase-
level IBM-1 and word-, phrase- and distortion-
penalties, which are combined in log-linear fash-
ion. Parameters are optimized with the Downhill-
Simplex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965) on the
word graph.

2.1.2 Hierarchical System
For the hierarchical setups described in this pa-

per, the open source Jane toolkit (Vilar et al., 2010)
is employed. Jane has been developed at RWTH
and implements the hierarchical approach as intro-
duced by Chiang (2007) with some state-of-the-art
extensions. In hierarchical phrase-based translation,
a weighted synchronous context-free grammar is in-
duced from parallel text. In addition to contiguous
lexical phrases, hierarchical phrases with up to two
gaps are extracted. The search is typically carried
out using the cube pruning algorithm (Huang and
Chiang, 2007). The model weights are optimized
with standard MERT (Och, 2003) on 100-best lists.

2.1.3 Phrase Model Training
For some PBT systems a forced alignment pro-

cedure was applied to train the phrase translation
model as described in Wuebker et al. (2010). A
modified version of the translation decoder is used
to produce a phrase alignment on the bilingual train-
ing data. The phrase translation probabilities are es-
timated from their relative frequencies in the phrase-
aligned training data. In addition to providing a sta-
tistically well-founded phrase model, this has the
benefit of producing smaller phrase tables and thus
allowing more rapid and less memory consuming
experiments with a better translation quality.

2.1.4 Final Systems
For the German→English task, RWTH conducted

experiments comparing the standard phrase extrac-
tion with the phrase training technique described in
Section 2.1.3. Further experiments included the use
of additional language model training data, rerank-
ing of n-best lists generated by the phrase-based sys-
tem, and different optimization criteria.

A considerable increase in translation quality can
be achieved by application of German compound
splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003). In comparison
to standard heuristic phrase extraction techniques,
performing force alignment phrase training (FA)
gives an improvement in BLEU on newstest2008
and newstest2009, but a degradation in TER. The
addition of LDC Gigaword corpora (+GW) to the
language model training data shows improvements
in both BLEU and TER. Reranking was done on
1000-best lists generated by the the best available

system (PBT (FA)+GW). Following models were
applied: n-gram posteriors (Zens and Ney, 2006),
sentence length model, a 6-gram LM and IBM-1 lex-
icon models in both normal and inverse direction.
These models are combined in a log-linear fashion
and the scaling factors are tuned in the same man-
ner as the baseline system (using TER−4BLEU on
newstest2009).

The final table includes two identical Jane sys-
tems which are optimized on different criteria. The
one optimized on TER−BLEU yields a much lower
TER.

2.2 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Single
System

2.2.1 Preprocessing
We preprocess the training data prior to training

the system, first by normalizing symbols such as
quotes, dashes and apostrophes. Then smart-casing
of the first words of each sentence is performed. For
the German part of the training corpus we use the
hunspell1 lexicon to learn a mapping from old Ger-
man spelling to new German spelling to obtain a cor-
pus with homogeneous spelling. In addition, we per-
form compound splitting as described in (Koehn and
Knight, 2003). Finally, we remove very long sen-
tences, empty lines, and sentences that probably are
not parallel due to length mismatch.

2.2.2 System Overview
The KIT system uses an in-house phrase-based

decoder (Vogel, 2003) to perform translation. Op-
timization with regard to the BLEU score is done
using Minimum Error Rate Training as described
by Venugopal et al. (2005). The translation model
is trained on the Europarl and News Commentary
Corpus and the phrase table is based on a GIZA++
Word Alignment. We use two 4-gram SRI language
models, one trained on the News Shuffle corpus and
one trained on the Gigaword corpus. Reordering is
performed based on continuous and non-continuous
POS rules to cover short and long-range reorder-
ings. The long-range reordering rules were also ap-
plied to the training corpus and phrase extraction
was performed on the resulting reordering lattices.
Part-of-speech tags are obtained using the TreeTag-

1http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/

359



ger (Schmid, 1994). In addition, the system applies
a bilingual language model to extend the context of
source language words available for translation. The
individual models are described briefly in the fol-
lowing.

2.2.3 POS-based Reordering Model
We use a reordering model that is based on parts-

of-speech (POS) and learn probabilistic rules from
the POS tags of the words in the training corpus and
the alignment information. In addition to continu-
ous reordering rules that model short-range reorder-
ing (Rottmann and Vogel, 2007), we apply non-
continuous rules to address long-range reorderings
as typical for German-English translation (Niehues
and Kolss, 2009). The reordering rules are applied
to the source sentences and the reordered sentence
variants as well as the original sequence are encoded
in a word lattice which is used as input to the de-
coder.

2.2.4 Lattice Phrase Extraction
For the test sentences, the POS-based reordering

allows us to change the word order in the source sen-
tence so that the sentence can be translated more eas-
ily. If we apply this also to the training sentences, we
would be able to extract also phrase pairs for origi-
nally discontinuous phrases and could apply them
during translation of reordered test sentences.

Therefore, we build reordering lattices for all
training sentences and then extract phrase pairs from
the monotone source path as well as from the re-
ordered paths. To limit the number of extracted
phrase pairs, we extract a source phrase only once
per sentence, even if it is found in different paths and
we only use long-range reordering rules to generate
the lattices for the training corpus.

2.2.5 Bilingual Language Model
In phrase-based systems the source sentence is

segmented by the decoder during the search pro-
cess. This segmentation into phrases leads to the
loss of context information at the phrase boundaries.
The language model can make use of more target
side context. To make also source language context
available we use a bilingual language model, an ad-
ditional language model in the phrase-based system
in which each token consist of a target word and all

source words it is aligned to. The bilingual tokens
enter the translation process as an additional target
factor.

2.3 LIMSI-CNRS Single System
2.3.1 System overview

The LIMSI system is built with n-code2, an open
source statistical machine translation system based
on bilingual n-grams.

2.3.2 n-code Overview
In a nutshell, the translation model is im-

plemented as a stochastic finite-state transducer
trained using a n-gram model of (source,target)
pairs (Casacuberta and Vidal, 2004). Training this
model requires to reorder source sentences so as to
match the target word order. This is performed by a
stochastic finite-state reordering model, which uses
part-of-speech information3 to generalize reordering
patterns beyond lexical regularities.

In addition to the translation model, eleven fea-
ture functions are combined: a target-language
model; four lexicon models; two lexicalized reorder-
ing models (Tillmann, 2004) aiming at predicting
the orientation of the next translation unit; a weak
distance-based distortion model; and finally a word-
bonus model and a tuple-bonus model which com-
pensate for the system preference for short transla-
tions. The four lexicon models are similar to the ones
use in a standard phrase based system: two scores
correspond to the relative frequencies of the tuples
and two lexical weights estimated from the automat-
ically generated word alignments. The weights asso-
ciated to feature functions are optimally combined
using a discriminative training framework (Och,
2003), using the newstest2009 data as development
set.

The overall search is based on a beam-search
strategy on top of a dynamic programming algo-
rithm. Reordering hypotheses are computed in a
preprocessing step, making use of reordering rules
built from the word reorderings introduced in the tu-
ple extraction process. The resulting reordering hy-
potheses are passed to the decoder in the form of
word lattices (Crego and Mariño, 2007).

puted using the TreeTagger.

2.3.3 Data Preprocessing
Based on previous experiments which have

demonstrated that better normalization tools provide
better BLEU scores (K. Papineni and Zhu, 2002),
all the English texts are tokenized and detokenized
with in-house text processing tools (Déchelotte et
al., 2008). For German, the standard tokenizer sup-
plied by evaluation organizers is used.

2.3.4 Target n-gram Language Models
The English language model is trained assuming

that the test set consists in a selection of news texts
dating from the end of 2010 to the beginning of
2011. This assumption is based on what was done
for the 2010 evaluation. Thus, a development cor-
pus is built in order to create a vocabulary and to
optimize the target language model.

Development Set and Vocabulary In order to
cover different period, two development sets are
used. The first one is newstest2008. However, this
corpus is two years older than the targeted time pe-
riod. Thus a second development corpus is gath-
ered by randomly sampling bunches of 5 consecu-
tive sentences from the provided news data of 2010
and 2011.

To estimate a LM, the English vocabulary is first
defined by including all tokens observed in the Eu-
roparl and news-commentary corpora. This vocabu-
lary is then expanded with all words that occur more
that 5 times in the French-English giga-corpus, and
with the most frequent proper names taken from the
monolingual news data of 2010 and 2011. This pro-
cedure results in a vocabulary around 500k words.

Language Model Training All the training data
allowed in the constrained task are divided into 9
sets based on dates on genres. On each set, a
standard 4-gram LM is estimated from the 500k
word vocabulary with in-house tools using abso-
lute discounting interpolated with lower order mod-
els (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman,
1998).

All LMs except the one trained on the news cor-
pora from 2010-2011 are first linearly interpolated.
The associated coefficients are estimated so as to
minimize the perplexity evaluated on the dev2010-
2011. The resulting LM and the 2010-2011 LM are

finally interpolated with newstest2008 as develop-
ment data. This two steps interpolation aims to avoid
an overestimate of the weight associated to the 2010-
2011 LM.

2.4 SYSTRAN Software, Inc. Single System
The data submitted by SYSTRAN were obtained by
the SYSTRAN baseline system in combination with
a statistical post editing (SPE) component.

The SYSTRAN system is traditionally classi-
fied as a rule-based system. However, over the
decades, its development has always been driven by
pragmatic considerations, progressively integrating
many of the most efficient MT approaches and tech-
niques. Nowadays, the baseline engine can be con-
sidered as a linguistic-oriented system making use of
dependency analysis, general transfer rules as well
as of large manually encoded dictionaries (100k −
800k entries per language pair).

The basic setup of the SPE component is identi-
cal to the one described in (L. Dugast and Koehn,
2007). A statistical translation model is trained on
the rule-based translation of the source and the tar-
get side of the parallel corpus. This is done sepa-
rately for each parallel corpus. Language models are
trained on each target half of the parallel corpora and
also on additional in-domain corpora. Moreover, the
following measures − limiting unwanted statistical
effects − were applied:

• Named entities are replaced by special tokens
on both sides. This usually improves word
alignment, since the vocabulary size is signif-
icantly reduced. In addition, entity translation
is handled more reliably by the rule-based en-
gine.

• The intersection of both vocabularies (i.e. vo-
cabularies of the rule-based output and the ref-
erence translation) is used to produce an addi-
tional parallel corpus (whose target is identical
to the source). This was added to the parallel
text in order to improve word alignment.

• Singleton phrase pairs are deleted from the
phrase table to avoid overfitting.

• Phrase pairs not containing the same number
of entities on the source and the target side are
also discarded.

361



• Phrase pairs appearing less than 2 times were
pruned.

The SPE language model was trained 15M
phrases from the news/europarl corpora, provided
as training data for WMT 2011. Weights for these
separate models were tuned by the MERT algorithm
provided in the Moses toolkit (P. Koehn et al., 2007),
using the provided news development set.

3 RWTH Aachen System Combination

System combination is used to produce consensus
translations from multiple hypotheses produced with
different translation engines that are better in terms
of translation quality than any of the individual hy-
potheses. The basic concept of RWTH’s approach
to machine translation system combination has been
described by Matusov et al. (2006; 2008). This ap-
proach includes an enhanced alignment and reorder-
ing framework. A lattice is built from the input hy-
potheses. The translation with the best score within
the lattice according to a couple of statistical mod-
els is selected as consensus translation. A deeper
description will be also given in the WMT11 sys-
tem combination paper of RWTH Aachen Univer-
sity. For this task only the A2L framework has been
used.

4 Experiments

We tried different system combinations with differ-
ent sets of single systems and different optimiza-
tion criteria. As RWTH has two different transla-
tion systems, we put the output of both systems into
system combination. Although both systems have
the same preprocessing, their hypotheses differ. Fi-
nally, we added for both RWTH systems two addi-
tional hypotheses to the system combination. The
two hypotheses of Jane were optimized on differ-
ent criteria. The first hypothesis was optimized on
BLEU and the second one on TER−BLEU. The first
RWTH phrase-based hypothesis was generated with
force alignment, the second RWTH phrase-based
hypothesis is a reranked version of the first one as
described in 2.1.4. Compared to the other systems,
the system by SYSTRAN has a completely different
approach (see section 2.4). It is mainly based on a
rule-based system. For the German→English pair,
SYSTRAN achieves a lower BLEU score in each

test set compared to the other groups. But since the
SYSTRAN system is very different to the others, we
still obtain an improvement when we add it also to
system combination.

We obtain the best result from system combina-
tion of all seven systems, optimizing the parameters
on BLEU. This system was the system we submitted
to the WMT 2011 evaluation.

For each dev set we obtain an improvement com-
pared to the best single systems. For newstest2008
and newstest2009 we get an improvement of 0.5
points in BLEU and 1.8 points in TER compared to
the best single system of Karlsruhe Institute of Tech-
nology. For newstest2010 we get an improvement
of 1.8 points in BLEU and 2.7 points in TER com-
pared to the best single system of RWTH. The sys-
tem combination weights optimized for the best run
are listed in Table 2. We see that although the single
system of SYSTRAN has the lowest BLEU scores,
it gets the second highest system weight. This high
value shows the influence of a completely different
system. On the other hand, all RWTH systems are
very similar, because of their same preprocessing
and their small variations. Therefor the system com-
bination parameter of all four systems by themselves
are relatively small. The summarized ”RWTH ap-
proach” system weight, though, is again on par with
the other systems.

5 Conclusion

The four statistical machine translation systems of
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, RWTH Aachen
and LIMSI and the very structural approach of SYS-
TRAN produce hypotheses with a huge variability
compared to the others. Finally the RWTH Aachen
system combination combined all single system hy-
potheses to one hypothesis with a higher BLEU
compared to each single system. If the system
combination implementation can handle enough sin-
gle systems we would recommend to add all single
systems to the system combination. Although the
single system of SYSTRAN has the lowest BLEU
scores and the RWTH single systems are similar we
achieved the best result in using all single systems.
