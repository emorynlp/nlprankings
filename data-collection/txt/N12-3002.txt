Abstract 

In this paper, we present XOpin, a graphical 
user interface that have been developed to 
provide a smart access to the results of a 
feature-based opinion detection system, build 
on top of a parser. 

1 Introduction 

Opinion mining (or sentiment analysis) arouses 
great interest in recent years both in academia and 
industry. Very broadly, sentiment analysis aims to 
detect the attitude of a person toward a specific 
topic expressed in natural language and to evaluate 
the polarity of what is been expressed, i.e., whether 
it is positive or negative. With the emergence of 
the Web 2.0, i.e., forums, blogs, web sites 
compiling consumer reviews on various subjects, 
there is a huge amount of documents containing 
information expressing opinions: the “user 
generated content”. This constitutes a very 
important data source for monitoring various 
applications (business intelligence, product and 
service benchmarking, technology watch). 
Numerous research works at the crossroads of NLP 
and data mining are focusing on the problem of 
opinion detection and mining. In this paper, we 
present the advanced research prototype we have 
designed: it consists in an integration of a feature-
based opinion detection system together with a 
graphical user interface providing to the end-user a 
smart access to the results of the opinion detection.  

We first present an overview of sentiment 
analysis. Then, we detail the system we have 
developed, in particular the graphical user 
interface, and conclude. 

2 Analyzing Sentiment in Texts 

Sentiment Analysis plays a very important role to 
help people to find better products or to compare 

product characteristics. For the consumer, a good 
interface allows to navigate, compare and identify 
the main characteristics of the products or 
companies. For the company, it is interesting to 
know the customer preferences. It is an essential 
step to optimize marketing campaigns and to 
develop new features in products.  

Despite the increase of interest in sentiment 
analysis, many tools do not pay much attention to 
the user interface aspects. These aspects are very 
important in order to satisfy the user needs. 

In the literature, we find some different ways to 
aggregate and represent the summary information 
from a collection of texts annotated with sentiment. 
For instance, Gamon et al. (2005) use colors to 
display the general assessment of product features. 
The system shows the reviews as boxes, where the 
box size indicates the number of mentions of that 
topic and the color indicates the average sentiment 
it contains. This interface allows having a quick 
glance about the most important topics and the 
sentiment expressed. 

Another display idea is presented in the 
Opinion Observer (Liu et al., 2005). In this system, 
a bar shows the polarity related with each product 
and each feature. The portions of the bar above and 
below a horizontal line represent the amount of 
positive and negative reviews. For example, in a 
cell phone domain, the sentiment associated with 
features like LCD, battery, reception and speaker 
are used to compare the relevance of one product 
in opposite to another. 

Morinaga et al. (2002) present an interface 
where the sentiment information is represented by 
the degrees of association between products and 
opinion-indicative terms. The author uses principal 
component analysis to produce a two-dimensional 
visualization where the terms and products are 
plotted indicating the relatedness among the points. 

In the internet, we can find many systems and 
companies related with sentiment analysis. For 
example, the company Lexalytics has in its website 

5



an available demo1  for sentiment detection. This 
demo shows an interface which highlights positive 
and negative words in the text. The interface also 
shows entities, categories associated, a summary 
and the top terms. 

The RankSpeed 2  is a website for product 
comparison. The website includes in the search the 
sentiment associated with each product. In the 
interface, the user can input a list of sentiment 
words, like “excellent”, “cool”, “easy” or 
“powerful” that the system will organize the results 
according the frequency of those words in reviews 
related to the products.  

The Stock Sonar3  has a timeline chart as the 
main interface. In this timeline, both positive and 
negative sentiments are displayed throughout time. 
The sentiments are retrieved from real-time news 
associated with a particular company. In the same 
timeline, it is possible to follow-up the increase or 
decrease of the stock prices for that company in 
that period of time. In this application, the 
sentiment is used to forecast market actions such as 
buy and sell stocks. 

All those systems presented relevant 
components for a powerful opinion mining 
interface, but none of them deliver a full interface 
to explore the multi-aspects in opinion mining. For 
us, a complete system should provide both single 
and multi-document visualization, work on the 
feature level classification, and produce an 
integrated interface to browse, navigate, filter and 
visualize files, features and sentiment tendencies. 
In the following section, we present XOpin, a 
graphical user interface that have been developed 
to provide the characteristics described.  

3 The System and its Interface 

To detect opinions in texts, our system relies on a 
robust incremental parser, XIP, (Ait-Mokhtar and 
Chanod 2002), specifically adapted for opinion 
detection. The system extracts opinions related to 
the main concepts commented in reviews (e.g. 
products, movies, books...), but also on features 
associated to these products (such as certain 
characteristics of the products, their price, 
associated services, etc...). More precisely, we 
adopt the formal representation of an opinion

proposed by Liu (2010): an opinion is represented 
as a five place predicate of the form 
�o�,f��, so���	, h�, t	� , where:o�  is the target of the 
opinion (the main concept), f��  is a feature 
associated to the object o�, 	so���	  is the value 
(positive or negative) of the opinion expressed by 
the opinion holder h� about the feature f��, h� is the 
opinion holder, t	 is the time when the opinion is 
expressed.  
We use the robust parser to extract, using syntactic 
relations already extracted by a general 
dependency grammar, semantic relations 
instantiating this model. Other systems use 
syntactic dependencies to link source and target of 
the opinion, for example in Kim and Hovy (2006). 
Our system belongs to this family, as we believe 
that syntactic processing of complex phenomena 
(negation, comparison and anaphora) is a 
necessary step to perform feature-based opinion 
mining. Another specificity of our system is a two 
level architecture based on a generic level, 
applicable to any domain, and on a domain-
dependent level, adapted for each sub-domain of 
application. Regarding evaluation, the relations of 
opinion extracted by the system have been used to 
train a SVM classifier in order to assess the 
system’s ability to correctly classify user’s reviews 
as positive or negative. Results are quite satisfying, 
as they show 93% of accuracy to classify reviews 
about printers and 89% of accuracy to classify 
reviews about movies (Brun, 2011). 

The XOpin Interface was developed to provide 
an easy way to allow the user to explore the results 
of this sentiment analysis system. The interface 
provides a graphical environment that allows the 
user to browse, navigate, filter and visualize the 
necessary information in a collection of texts.  

The tool accepts as input pure text files or xml 
files. The xml files follow a specific format which 
allows the system to retrieve metadata information. 
It is also possible to retrieve web pages from the 
web. The tool offers the possibility to retrieve a 
single webpage, given the URL, or a collection of 
pages by crawling. To crawl, for example, reviews 
webpages, the user need to setup some crawling 
and information extraction rules defined by a 
template in the configuration file. The files 
retrieved from the web are converted in xml 
format, which allows preserving the metadata 
information. As an example, Figure 1 shows the 

6



organization of this xml file from a review 
retrieved from the website epinions.com 
(http://www.epinions.com). 

 

 
Figure 1. Organization of the XML file 

 
The tag source keeps the URL from where the 

review was extracted. The tags domain, brand and 
product keep the specific data about to the product. 
The tag opinion_holder keeps the name of the user 
who wrote the review. The tag review_date keeps 
the date when the review was written. The tag 
opinion keeps the user general assessment about 
the product. In the website epinions.com, the user 
can assess the product as recommended (Yes) or 
not recommended (No). The tag review_stars 
contains the number of stars the user attributed to 
the product. The tag review_popularity keeps the 
number of positive evaluations (thumbsUp) of this 
particular review by the other users. In the reviews 
from the website epinions.com we don’t have this 
assessment, so this number represents how many 
users assigned to trust in this reviewer. The tags 
textblock contain the text for the sections title, 
summary and review. 

After loading a file or a corpus into the tool, the 
texts are showed in a tree structure in the left 
panel. A hierarchical structure allows the user to 
have the corpus organized as a conventional folder 
structure. In this way, it is possible to analyze the 

texts inside a specific folder and also to include the 
texts in the subfolders inside. 

To analyze this data, the tool presents three 
main views: text, timeline and comparison. In the 
text view, negative terms, positive terms and 
entities present in the text are highlighted. The 
purpose of this view is to provide a visual 
assessment about the sentiment expressed in the 
text. If the text was loaded by crawling or by an 
xml file, the metadata is also displayed. Figure 2 
shows an example of reviews collected from the 
website epinions.com, in the category printers.  

As said before, XOpin is able to identify the 
predicates associated with each sentiment and the 
category it belongs. For example, in the sentence 
“This printer gives excellent quality color”, the 
tool highlights the positive sentiment “excellent”, 
the predicate associated “color” and organize this 
predicate into the category color. This predicate 
categorization depends of the sub-domain 
architecture level. 

 This classification is very important to present 
an organized summary about which category is 
most positive and with is most negative in the text. 
The right panel shows this information. 

 
Figure 2. Text visualization in XOpin 

 
The timeline screen (Figure 3) offers the user 

the option to analyze a corpus of texts organized 
by time, for example, reviews crawled from the 
web. In this way, the user can create flexible and 
interesting views about the products and features 
found in the corpus.  

The timeline shows the total of positive and 
negative words in the texts for a given date. With 
this information and a larger enough corpus of 
reviews it is possible to have a big picture about 
the user preferences and dissatisfactions. 

The timeline also offers the possibility to show 
the positive and negative lines for specific brands, 

<review> 

<source value="http://..." /> 

<domain value="Printers"/> 

<brand value="Hewlett Packard"/> 

<product value=" Hewlett Packard 6500A"/> 

<opinion_holder value="user_name"/> 

<review_date value="01/Dec/2011"/> 

<opinion value="Yes"/> 

<review_stars value="5"/> 

<review_popularity value="10"/>

products and features in a determined timespan. 
Filters can remove anything that it is not useful and 
create a pure visualization about what the user 
need to see. The left and bottom panels offer 
options to create those views. 

These views can show an evolution in the 
user’s perspective in respect to some new 
improvement in the product. For example, in a 
marketing campaign, the company can evaluate the 
user behavior about the product price.

The comparison view (Figure 4) allows the user 

to compare side by side different product features 
in a collection of texts. In this view, the user has 
the main predicate associated with each feature and 
the number of positive or negative occurrences. 
This is interesting in order to have a big picture 
about what the users are commenting in positive or 
negative aspects for each feature.

4 Conclusion 

This paper presents an NLP-based opinion 
mining advanced prototype integrating a dedicated 
graphical user interface which provides a smart 

access to the results of the opinion detection. The 
interface has been build in order to ensure 
advanced functionalities such as opinion 
highlighting on text and features, timeline 
visualization and feature comparison. The system 
has been demonstrated to potential customers and 
it received a good feedback. In our assessment, the 
integrated features provided by the system 
increased the usability in the data exploration for a 
reviews corpus compared against other products.
