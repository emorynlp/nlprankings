Abstract

We present a human judgments dataset
and an adapted metric for evaluation of
Arabic machine translation. Our medium-
scale dataset is the first of its kind for Ara-
bic with high annotation quality. We use
the dataset to adapt the BLEU score for
Arabic. Our score (AL-BLEU) provides
partial credits for stem and morphologi-
cal matchings of hypothesis and reference
words. We evaluate BLEU, METEOR and
AL-BLEU on our human judgments cor-
pus and show that AL-BLEU has the high-
est correlation with human judgments. We
are releasing the dataset and software to
the research community.

1 Introduction

Evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) contin-
ues to be a challenging research problem. There
is an ongoing effort in finding simple and scal-
able metrics with rich linguistic analysis. A wide
range of metrics have been proposed and evaluated
mostly for European target languages (Callison-
Burch et al., 2011; Macháček and Bojar, 2013).
These metrics are usually evaluated based on their
correlation with human judgments on a set of MT
output. While there has been growing interest in
building systems for translating into Arabic, the
evaluation of Arabic MT is still an under-studied
problem. Standard MT metrics such as BLEU (Pa-
pineni et al., 2002) or TER (Snover et al., 2006)
have been widely used for evaluating Arabic MT
(El Kholy and Habash, 2012). These metrics use
strict word and phrase matching between the MT
output and reference translations. For morpholog-
ically rich target languages such as Arabic, such
criteria are too simplistic and inadequate. In this
paper, we present: (a) the first human judgment
dataset for Arabic MT (b) the Arabic Language

BLEU (AL-BLEU), an extension of the BLEU
score for Arabic MT evaluation.

Our annotated dataset is composed of the output
of six MT systems with texts from a diverse set of
topics. A group of ten native Arabic speakers an-
notated this corpus with high-levels of inter- and
intra-annotator agreements. Our AL-BLEU met-
ric uses a rich set of morphological, syntactic and
lexical features to extend the evaluation beyond
the exact matching. We conduct different exper-
iments on the newly built dataset and demonstrate
that AL-BLEU shows a stronger average correla-
tion with human judgments than the BLEU and
METEOR scores. Our dataset and our AL-BLEU
metric provide useful testbeds for further research
on Arabic MT and its evaluation.1

2 Related Work

Several studies on MT evaluation have pointed out
the inadequacy of the standard n-gram based eval-
uation metrics for various languages (Callison-
Burch et al., 2006). For morphologically complex
languages and those without word delimiters, sev-
eral studies have attempted to improve upon them
and suggest more reliable metrics that correlate
better with human judgments (Denoual and Lep-
age, 2005; Homola et al., 2009).

A common approach to the problem of mor-
phologically complex words is to integrate some
linguistic knowledge in the metric. ME-
TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), TER-
Plus (Snover et al., 2010) incorporate limited lin-
guistic resources. Popović and Ney (2009) showed
that n-gram based evaluation metrics calculated on
POS sequences correlate well with human judg-
ments, and recently designed and evaluated MPF,
a BLEU-style metric based on morphemes and
POS tags (Popović, 2011). In the same direc-

tion, Chen and Kuhn (2011) proposed AMBER,
a modified version of BLEU incorporating re-
call, extra penalties, and light linguistic knowl-
edge about English morphology. Liu et al. (2010)
propose TESLA-M, a variant of a metric based
on n-gram matching that utilizes light-weight lin-
guistic analysis including lemmatization, POS tag-
ging, and WordNet synonym relations. This met-
ric was then extended to TESLA-B to model
phrase synonyms by exploiting bilingual phrase
tables (Dahlmeier et al., 2011). Tantug et al.
(2008) presented BLEU+, a tool that implements
various extension to BLEU computation to allow
for a better evaluation of the translation perfor-
mance for Turkish.

To the best of our knowledge the only human
judgment dataset for Arabic MT is the small cor-
pus which was used to tune parameters of the ME-
TEOR metric for Arabic (Denkowski and Lavie,
2011). Due to the shortage of Arabic human judg-
ment dataset, studies on the performance of eval-
uation metrics have been constrained and limited.
A relevant effort in this area is the upper-bound es-
timation of BLEU and METEOR scores for Ara-
bic MT output (El Kholy and Habash, 2011). As
part of its extensive functionality, the AMEANA
system provides the upper-bound estimate by an
exhaustive matching of morphological and lexical
features between the hypothesis and the reference
translations. Our use of morphological and lex-
ical features overlaps with the AMEANA frame-
work. However, we extend our partial matching
to a supervised tuning framework for estimating
the value of partial credits. Moreover, our human
judgment dataset allows us to validate our frame-
work with a large-scale gold-standard data.

3 Human judgment dataset

We describe here our procedure for compiling a
diverse Arabic MT dataset and annotating it with
human judgments.

3.1 Data and systems

We annotate a corpus composed of three datasets:
(1) the standard English-Arabic NIST 2005 cor-
pus, commonly used for MT evaluations and com-
posed of news stories. We use the first English
translation as the source and the single corre-
sponding Arabic sentence as the reference. (2) the
MEDAR corpus (Maegaard et al., 2010) that con-
sists of texts related to the climate change with

four Arabic reference translations. We only use
the first reference in this study. (3) a small dataset
of Wikipedia articles (WIKI) to extend our cor-
pus and metric evaluation to topics beyond the
commonly-used news topics. This sub-corpus
consists of our in-house Arabic translations of
seven English Wikipedia articles. The articles are:
Earl Francis Lloyd, Western Europe, Citizenship,
Marcus Garvey, Middle Age translation, Acadian,
NBA. The English articles which do not exist in
the Arabic Wikipedia were manually translated by
a bilingual linguist.

Table 1 gives an overview of these sub-corpora
characteristics.

NIST MEDAR WIKI
# of Documents 100 4 7
# of Sentences 1056 509 327

Table 1: Statistics on the datasets.

We use six state-of-the-art English-to-Arabic
MT systems. These include four research-oriented
phrase-based systems with various morphological
and syntactic features and different Arabic tok-
enization schemes and also two commercial off-
the-shelf systems.

3.2 Annotation of human judgments

In order conduct a manual evaluation of the six
MT systems, we formulated it as a ranking prob-
lem. We adapt the framework used in the WMT
2011 shared task for evaluating MT metrics on
European language pairs (Callison-Burch et al.,
2011) for Arabic MT. We gather human ranking
judgments by asking ten annotators (each native
speaker of Arabic with English as a second lan-
guage) to assess the quality of the English-Arabic
systems, by ranking sentences relative to each
other, from the best to the worst (ties are allowed).

We use the Appraise toolkit (Federmann, 2012)
designed for manual MT evaluation. The tool dis-
plays to the annotator, the source sentence and
translations produced by various MT systems. The
annotators received initial training on the tool and
the task with ten sentences. They were presented
with a brief guideline indicating the purpose of the
task and the main criteria of MT output evaluation.

Each annotator was assigned to 22 ranking
tasks. Each task included ten screens. Each screen
involveed ranking translations of ten sentences. In
total, we collected 22, 000 rankings for 1892 sen-

208



tences (22 tasks×10 screens×10 judges). In each
annotation screen, the annotator was shown the
source-language (English) sentences, as well as
five translations to be ranked. We did not provide
annotators with the reference to avoid any bias in
the annotation process. Each source sentence was
presented with its direct context. Rather than at-
tempting to get a complete ordering over the sys-
tems, we instead relied on random selection and a
reasonably large sample size to make the compar-
isons fair (Callison-Burch et al., 2011).

An example of a source sentence and its five
translations to be ranked is given in Table 2.

3.3 Annotation quality and analysis

In order to ensure the validity of any evaluation
setup, a reasonable of inter- and intra-annotator
agreement rates in ranking should exist. To mea-
sure these agreements, we deliberately reassigned
10% of the tasks to second annotators. More-
over, we ensured that 10% of the screens are re-
displayed to the same annotator within the same
task. This procedure allowed us to collect reliable
quality control measure for our dataset.

Table 3: Inter- and intra-annotator agreement
scores for our annotation compared to the aver-
age scores for five English to five European lan-
guages and also English-Czech (Callison-Burch et
al., 2011).

We measured head-to-head pairwise agreement
among annotators using Cohen’s kappa (κ) (Co-
hen, 1968), defined as follows:

κ =
P (A)− P (E)

1− P (E)

where P(A) is the proportion of times annotators
agree and P(E) is the proportion of agreement by
chance.

Table 3 gives average values obtained for inter-
annotator and intra-annotator agreement and com-
pare our results to similar annotation efforts in
WMT-13 on different European languages. Here
we compare against the average agreement for En-
glish to five languages and also from English to

one morphologically rich language (Czech).4

Based on Landis and Koch (1977) κ interpre-
tation, the κinter value (57%) and also compar-
ing our agreement scores with WMT-13 annota-
tions, we believe that we have reached a reliable
and consistent annotation quality.

4 AL-BLEU

Despite its well-known shortcomings (Callison-
Burch et al., 2006), BLEU continues to be the
de-facto MT evaluation metric. BLEU uses an
exact n-gram matching criterion that is too strict
for a morphologically rich language like Arabic.
The system outputs in Table 2 are examples of
how BLEU heavily penalizes Arabic. Based on
BLEU, the best hypothesis is from Sys5 which has
three unigram and one bigram exact matches with
the reference. However, the sentence is the 4th

ranked by annotators. In contrast, the output of
Sys3 (ranked 1st by annotators) has only one ex-
act match, but several partial matches when mor-
phological and lexical information are taken into
consideration.

We propose the Arabic Language BLEU (AL-
BLEU) metric which extends BLEU to deal with
Arabic rich morphology. We extend the matching
to morphological, syntactic and lexical levels with
an optimized partial credit. AL-BLEU starts with
the exact matching of hypothesis tokens against
the reference tokens. Furthermore, it considers the
following: (a) morphological and syntactic feature
matching, (b) stem matching. Based on Arabic lin-
guistic intuition, we check the matching of a sub-
set of 5 morphological features: (i) POS tag, (ii)
gender (iii) number (iv) person (v) definiteness.
We use the MADA package (Habash et al., 2009)
to collect the stem and the morphological features
of the hypothesis and reference translation.

Figure 1 summarizes the function in which we
consider partial matching (m(th, tr)) of a hypoth-
esis token (th) and its associated reference token
(tr). Starting with the BLEU criterion, we first
check if the hypothesis token is same as the ref-
erence one and provide the full credit for it. If
the exact matching fails, we provide partial credit
for matching at the stem and morphological level.
The value of the partial credits are the sum of
the stem weight (ws) and the morphological fea-

performed by WMT researchers which are higher than the
WMT annotations on Mechanical Turk.

ture weights (wfi). Each weight is included in
the partial score, if such matching exist (e.g., stem
match). In order to avoid over-crediting, we limit
the range of weights with a set of constraints.
Moreover, we use a development set to optimize
the weights towards improvement of correlation
with human judgments, using a hill-climbing al-
gorithm (Russell and Norvig, 2009). Figure 2 il-
lustrates these various samples of partial matching
highlighted in different colors.

Following the BLEU-style exact matching and
scoring of different n-grams, AL-BLEU updates
the n-gram scores with the partial credits from
non-exact matches. We use a minimum partial

credit for n-grams which have tokens with dif-
ferent matching score. The contribution of a
partially-matched n-gram is not 1 (as counted in
BLEU), but the minimum value that individual to-
kens within the bigram are credited. For exam-
ple, if a bigram is composed of a token with exact
matching and a token with stem matching, this bi-
gram receives a credit equal to a unigram with the
stem matching (a value less than 1). While par-
tial credits are added for various n-grams, the fi-
nal computation of the AL-BLEU is similar to the
original BLEU based on the geometric mean of the
different matched n-grams. We follow BLEU in
using a very small smoothing value to avoid zero
n-gram counts and zero score.

5 Experiments and results

An automatic evaluation metric is said to be suc-
cessful if it is shown to have high agreement with
human-performed evaluations (Soricut and Brill,
2004). We use Kendall’s tau τ (Kendall, 1938),
a coefficient to measure the correlation between
the system rankings and the human judgments at
the sentence level. Kendall’s tau τ is calculated as
follows:

τ =
# of concordant pairs - # of discordant pairs

total pairs

where a concordant pair indicates two translations
of the same sentence for which the ranks obtained
from the manual ranking task and from the corre-
sponding metric scores agree (they disagree in a
discordant pair). The possible values of τ range
from -1 (all pairs are discordant) to 1 (all pairs

are concordant). Thus, an automatic evaluation
metric with a higher τ value is making predic-
tions that are more similar to the human judgments
than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower
τ . We calculate the τ score for each sentence and
average the scores to reach the corpus-level cor-
relation. We conducted a set of experiments to
compare the correlation of AL-BLEU against the
state-of-the art MT evaluation metrics. For this we
use a subset of 900 sentences extracted from the
dataset described in Section 3.1. As mentioned
above, the stem and morphological features in AL-
BLEU are parameterized each by weights which
are used to calculate the partial credits. We op-
timize the value of each weight towards correla-
tion with human judgment by hill climbing with
100 random restarts using a development set of
600 sentences. The 300 remaining sentences (100
from each corpus) are kept for testing. The de-
velopment and test sets are composed of equal
portions of sentences from the three sub-corpora
(NIST, MEDAR, WIKI).

As baselines, we measured the correlation of
BLEU and METEOR with human judgments col-
lected for each sentence. We did not observe
a strong correlation with the Arabic-tuned ME-
TEOR. We conducted our experiments on the stan-
dard METEOR which was a stronger baseline than
its Arabic version. In order to avoid the zero n-
gram counts and artificially low BLEU scores, we
use a smoothed version of BLEU. We follow Liu
and Gildea (2005) to add a small value to both the
matched n-grams and the total number of n-grams
(epsilon value of 10−3). In order to reach an op-
timal ordering of partial matches, we conducted a
set of experiments in which we compared differ-
ent orders between the morphological and lexical
matchings to settle with the final order which was
presented in Figure 1.

Table 4 shows a comparison of the average cor-
relation with human judgments for BLEU, ME-

TEOR and AL-BLEU. AL-BLEU shows a strong
improvement against BLEU and a competitive im-
provement against METEOR both on the test and
development sets. The example in Table 2 shows
a sample case of such improvement. In the ex-
ample, the sentence ranked the highest by the an-
notator has only two exact matching with the ref-
erence translation (which results in a low BLEU
score). The stem and morphological matching of
AL-BLEU, gives a score and ranking much closer
to human judgments.

6 Conclusion

We presented AL-BLEU, our adaptation of BLEU
for the evaluation of machine translation into Ara-
bic. The metric uses morphological, syntactic and
lexical matching to go beyond exact token match-
ing. We also presented our annotated corpus of
human ranking judgments for evaluation of Ara-
bic MT. The size and diversity of the topics in
the corpus, along with its relatively high annota-
tion quality (measured by IAA scores) makes it
a useful resource for future research on Arabic
MT. Moreover, the strong performance of our AL-
BLEU metric is a positive indicator for future ex-
ploration of richer linguistic information in evalu-
ation of Arabic MT.
