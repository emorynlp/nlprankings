Abstract

We validated various novel and recently
proposed methods for statistical machine
translation on 10 language pairs, using
large data resources. We saw gains
from optimizing parameters, training with
sparse features, the operation sequence
model, and domain adaptation techniques.
We also report on utilizing a huge lan-
guage model trained on 126 billion tokens.

The annual machine translation evaluation cam-
paign for European languages organized around
the ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Trans-
lation offers the opportunity to test recent advance-
ments in machine translation in large data condi-
tion across several diverse language pairs.

Building on our own developments and external
contributions to the Moses open source toolkit, we
carried out extensive experiments that, by early in-
dications, led to a strong showing in the evaluation
campaign.

We would like to stress especially two contri-
butions: the use of the new operation sequence
model (Section 3) within Moses, and — in a sepa-
rate unconstraint track submission — the use of a
huge language model trained on 126 billion tokens
with a new training tool (Section 4).

1 Initial System Development

We start with systems (Haddow and Koehn, 2012)
that we developed for the 2012 Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (Callison-Burch
et al., 2012). The notable features of these systems
are:
• Moses phrase-based models with mostly de-

fault settings
• training on all available parallel data, includ-

ing the large UN parallel data, the French-
English 109 parallel data and the LDC Giga-
word data

• very large tuning set consisting of the test sets
from 2008-2010, with a total of 7,567 sen-
tences per language
• German–English with syntactic pre-

reordering (Collins et al., 2005), compound
splitting (Koehn and Knight, 2003) and use
of factored representation for a POS target
sequence model (Koehn and Hoang, 2007)
• English–German with morphological target

sequence model

Note that while our final 2012 systems in-
cluded subsampling of training data with modified
Moore-Lewis filtering (Axelrod et al., 2011), we
did not use such filtering at the starting point of
our development. We will report on such filtering
in Section 2.

Moreover, our system development initially
used the WMT 2012 data condition, since it took
place throughout 2012, and we switched to WMT
2013 training data at a later stage. In this sec-
tion, we report cased BLEU scores (Papineni et al.,
2001) on newstest2011.

1.1 Factored Backoff (German–English)
We have consistently used factored models in past
WMT systems for the German–English language
pairs to include POS and morphological target se-
quence models. But we did not use the factored
decomposition of translation options into multi-
ple mapping steps, since this usually lead to much
slower systems with usually worse results.

A good place, however, for factored decompo-
sition is the handling of rare and unknown source
words which have more frequent morphological
variants (Koehn and Haddow, 2012a). Here, we
used only factored backoff for unknown words,
giving gains in BLEU of +.12 for German–English.

1.2 Tuning with k-best MIRA
In preparation for training with sparse features, we
moved away from MERT which is known to fall

114



apart with many more than a couple of dozen fea-
tures. Instead, we used k-best MIRA (Cherry and
Foster, 2012). For the different language pairs, we
saw improvements in BLEU of -.05 to +.39, with an
average of +.09. There was only a minimal change
in the length ratio (Table 1)

1.3 Translation Table Smoothing with
Kneser-Ney Discounting

Previously, we smoothed counts for the phrasal
conditional probability distributions in the trans-
lation model with Good Turing discounting. We
explored the use of Kneser-Ney discounting, but
results are mixed (no difference on average, see
Table 2), so we did not pursue this further.

1.4 Sparse Features

A significant extension of the Moses system over
the last couple of years was the support for large
numbers of sparse features. This year, we tested
this capability on our big WMT systems. First, we
used features proposed by Chiang et al. (2009):

• phrase pair count bin features (bins 1, 2, 3,
4–5, 6–9, 10+)
• target word insertion features
• source word deletion features
• word translation features
• phrase length feature (source, target, both)

The lexical features were restricted to the 50 most
frequent words. All these features together only
gave minor improvements (Table 3).

Table 3: Sparse features

We also explored domain features in the sparse
feature framework, in three different variations.
Assume that we have three domains, and a phrase
pair occurs in domain A 15 times, in domain B 5
times, and in domain C never.

We compute three types of domain features:

• binary indicator, if phrase-pairs occurs in do-
main (example: indA = 1, indB = 1, indC = 0)
• ratio how frequent the phrase pairs occurs in

domain (example: ratioA = 1515+5 = .75, ratioB =
5

15+5
= .25, ratioC = 0)

• subset of domains in which phrase pair oc-
curs (example: subsetAB = 1, other subsets 0)

We tested all three feature types, and found
the biggest gain with the domain indicator feature
(+.11, Table 4). Note that we define as domain the
different corpora (Europarl, etc.). The number of
domains ranges from 2 to 9 (see column #d).1

Table 4: Sparse domain features

When combining the domain features and the
other sparse features, we see roughly additive
gains (Table 5). We use the domain indicator fea-
ture and the other sparse features in subsequent ex-
periments.

1In the final experiments on the 2013 data condition, one
domain (commoncrawl) was added for all language pairs.

1.5 Tuning Settings

Given the opportunity to explore the parameter
tuning of models with sparse features across many
language pairs, we investigated a number of set-
tings. We expect tuning to work better with more
iterations, longer n-best lists and bigger cube prun-
ing pop limits. Our baseline settings are 10 itera-
tions with 100-best lists (accumulating) and a pop
limit of 1000 for tuning and 5000 for testing.

base 25 it. 25it+1k-best 25it+pop5k

en-cs 17.38 17.43 +.05 17.50 +.12 17.38 ±.00
avg – +.03 +.05 +.02

Table 6: Tuning settings (number of iterations, size of n-best
list, and cube pruning pop limit)

Results support running tuning for 25 iterations
but we see no gains for 5000 pops. There is ev-
idence that an n-best list size of 1000 is better in
tuning but we did not adopt this since these large
lists take up a lot of disk space and slow down the
MIRA optimization step (Table 6).

1.6 Smaller Phrases

Given the very large corpus sizes (up to a billion
words of parallel data for French–English), the
size of translation model and lexicalized reorder-
ing model becomes a challenge. Hence, we want
to examine if restriction to smaller phrases is fea-
sible without loss in translation quality. Results
in Table 7 suggest that a maximum phrase length
of 5 gives almost identical results, and only with
a phrase length limit of 4 significant losses occur.
We adopted the limit of 5.

1.7 Unpruned Language Models
Previously, we trained 5-gram language models
using the default settings of the SRILM toolkit in
terms of singleton pruning. Thus, training throws
out all singletons n-grams of order 3 and higher.
We explored whether unpruned language models
could give better performance, even if we are only
able to train 4-gram models due to memory con-
straints. At the time, we were not able to build un-
pruned 4-gram language models for English, but
for the other language pairs we did see improve-
ments of -.07 to +.13 (Table 8). We adopted such
models for these language pairs.

1.8 Translations per Input Phrase
Finally, we explored one more parameter: the limit
on how many translation options are considered
per input phrase. The default for this setting is 20.
However, our experiments (Table 9) show that we
can get better results with a translation table limit
of 100, so we adopted this.

1.9 Other Experiments
We explored a number of other settings and fea-
tures, but did not observe any gains.

• Using HMM alignment instead of IBM
Model 4 leads to losses of –.01 to –.27.
• An earlier check of modified Moore–Lewis

filtering (see also below in Section 3) gave
very inconsistent results.
• Filtering the phrase table with significance

filtering (Johnson et al., 2007) leads to losses
of –.19 to –.63.
• Throwing out phrase pairs with direct transla-

tion probability φ(ē|f̄) of less than 10−5 has
almost no effect.
• Double-checking the contribution of the

sparse lexical features in the final setup, we
observe an average losses of –.07 when drop-
ping these features.
• For the German–English language pairs we

saw some benefits to using sparse lexical fea-
tures over POS tags instead of words, so we
used this in the final system.

1.10 Summary
We adopted a number of changes that improved
our baseline system by an average of +.30, see Ta-
ble 10 for a breakdown.

Table 10: Summary of impact of changes

Minor improvements that we did not adopt was
avoiding reducing maximum phrase length to 5
(average +.03) and tuning with 1000-best lists
(+.02).

The improvements differed significantly by lan-
guage pair, as detailed in Table 11, with the
biggest gains for English–French (+.70), no gain
for English–German and no gain for English–
German.

1.11 New Data
The final experiment of the initial system devel-
opment phase was to train the systems on the new
data, adding newstest2011 to the tuning set (now
10,068 sentences). Table 12 reports the gains on
newstest2012 due to added data, indicating very
clearly that valuable new data resources became
available this year.

2 Domain Adaptation Techniques

We explored two additional domain adaptation
techniques: phrase table interpolation and modi-
fied Moore-Lewis filtering.

2.1 Phrase Table Interpolation
We experimented with phrase-table interpolation
using perplexity minimisation (Foster et al., 2010;
Sennrich, 2012). In particular, we used the im-
plementation released with Sennrich (2012) and
available in Moses, comparing both the naive and
modified interpolation methods from that paper.
For each language pair, we took the alignments
created from all the data concatenated, built sepa-
rate phrase tables from each of the individual cor-
pora, and interpolated using each method. The re-
sults are shown in Table 13

Table 13: Comparison of phrase-table interpolation (two
methods) with baseline (on newstest2012). The baselines are
as Table 12 except for the starred rows where tuning with
PRO was found to be better. The modified interpolation was
not possible in fr↔en as it uses to much RAM.

The results from the phrase-table interpolation
are quite mixed, and we only used the technique

117



for the final system in en-es. An interpolation
based on PRO has recently been shown (Haddow,
2013) to improve on perplexity minimisation is
some cases, but the current implementation of this
method is limited to 2 phrase-tables, so we did not
use it in this evaluation.

2.2 Modified Moore-Lewis Filtering

In last year’s evaluation (Koehn and Haddow,
2012b) we had some success with modified
Moore-Lewis filtering (Moore and Lewis, 2010;
Axelrod et al., 2011) of the training data. This
year we conducted experiments in most of the lan-
guage pairs using MML filtering, and also exper-
imented using instance weighting (Mansour and
Ney, 2012) using the (exponential of) the MML
weights. The results are show in Table 14

Table 14: Comparison of MML filtering and weighting with
baseline. The MML uses monolingual news as in-domain,
and selects from all training data after alignment.The weight-
ing uses the MML weights, optionally downscaled by 10,
then exponentiated. Baselines are as Table 13.

As with phrase-table interpolation, MML filter-
ing and weighting shows a very mixed picture, and
not the consistent improvements these techniques
offer on IWSLT data. In the final systems, we used
MML filtering only for es-en.

3 Operation Sequence Model (OSM)

We enhanced the phrase segmentation and re-
ordering mechanism by integrating OSM: an op-
eration sequence N-gram-based translation and re-
ordering model (Durrani et al., 2011) into the
Moses phrase-based decoder. The model is based
on minimal translation units (MTUs) and Markov
chains over sequences of operations. An opera-
tion can be (a) to jointly generate a bi-language
MTU, composed from source and target words, or
(b) to perform reordering by inserting gaps and do-
ing jumps.

Model: Given a bilingual sentence pair <
F,E > and its alignment A, we transform it to

Figure 1: Bilingual Sentence with Alignments

sequence of operations (o1, o2, . . . , oJ ) and learn
a Markov model over this sequence as:

posm(F,E,A) = p(o
J
1 ) =

J∏

j=1

p(oj |oj−n+1, ..., oj−1)

By coupling reordering with lexical generation,
each (translation or reordering) decision condi-
tions on n − 1 previous (translation and reorder-
ing) decisions spanning across phrasal boundaries
thus overcoming the problematic phrasal indepen-
dence assumption in the phrase-based model. In
the OSM model, the reordering decisions influ-
ence lexical selection and vice versa. Lexical gen-
eration is strongly coupled with reordering thus
improving the overall reordering mechanism.

We used the modified version of the OSM
model (Durrani et al., 2013b) that addition-
ally handles discontinuous and unaligned target
MTUs3. We borrow 4 count-based supportive fea-
tures, the Gap, Open Gap, Gap-width and Dele-
tion penalties from Durrani et al. (2011).

Training: During training, each bilingual sen-
tence pair is deterministically converted to a
unique sequence of operations. Please refer to
Durrani et al. (2011) for a list of operations and
the conversion algorithm and see Figure 1 and Ta-
ble 15 for a sample bilingual sentence pair and
its step-wise conversion into a sequence of oper-
ation. A 9-gram Kneser-Ney smoothed operation
sequence model is trained with SRILM.

Search: Although the OSM model is based on
minimal units, phrase-based search on top of OSM
model was found to be superior to the MTU-based
decoding in Durrani et al. (2013a). Following this
framework allows us to use OSM model in tandem
with phrase-based models. We integrated the gen-
erative story of the OSM model into the hypothe-
sis extension of the phrase-based Moses decoder.
Please refer to (Durrani et al., 2013b) for details.

Results: Table 16 shows case-sensitive BLEU
scores on newstest2012 and newstest2013 for fi-

3In the original OSM model these are removed from the
alignments through a post-processing heuristic which hurts in
some language pairs. See Durrani et al. (2013b) for detailed
experiments.

Table 16: Results using the OSM Feature

nal systems from Section 1 and these systems aug-
mented with the operation sequence model. The
model gives gains for all language pairs (BLEU
+.09 to +.90, average +.37, on newstest2013).

4 Huge Language Models

To overcome the memory limitations of SRILM,
we implemented modified Kneser-Ney (Kneser
and Ney, 1995; Chen and Goodman, 1998)
smoothing from scratch using disk-based stream-
ing algorithms. This open-source4 tool is de-
scribed fully by Heafield et al. (2013). We used it
to estimate an unpruned 5–gram language model
on web pages from ClueWeb09.5 The corpus was
preprocessed by removing spam (Cormack et al.,
2011), selecting English documents, splitting sen-
tences, deduplicating, tokenizing, and truecasing.
Estimation on the remaining 126 billion tokens
took 2.8 days on a single machine with 140 GB
RAM (of which 123 GB was used at peak) and six
hard drives in a RAID5 configuration. Statistics
about the resulting model are shown in Table 17.

5 orders in the unconstrained language model

The large language model was then quantized
to 10 bits and compressed to 643 GB with KenLM
(Heafield, 2011), loaded onto a machine with 1
TB RAM, and used as an additional feature in
unconstrained French–English, Spanish–English,
and Czech–English submissions. This additional
language model is the only difference between our
final constrained and unconstrained submissions;
no additional parallel data was used. Results are
shown in Table 18. Improvement from large lan-
guage models is not a new result (Brants et al.,
2007); the primary contribution is estimating on a
single machine.

Table 18: Gain on newstest2013 from the unconstrained lan-

limited so Russian–English was run after the deadline and
German–English was not ready in time.

5 Summary

Table 19 breaks down the gains over the final sys-
tem from Section 1 from using the operation se-
quence models (OSM), modified Moore-Lewis fil-
tering (MML), fixing a bug with the sparse lex-
ical features (Sparse-Lex Bugfix), and instance
weighting (Instance Wt.), translation model com-
bination (TM-Combine), and use of the huge lan-
guage model (ClueWeb09 LM).
