Abstract

Automatically clustering words from a mono-
lingual or bilingual training corpus into
classes is a widely used technique in statisti-
cal natural language processing. We present
a very simple and easy to implement method
for using these word classes to improve trans-
lation quality. It can be applied across differ-
ent machine translation paradigms and with
arbitrary types of models. We show its ef-
ficacy on a small German→English and a
larger French→German translation task with
both standard phrase-based and hierarchical
phrase-based translation systems for a com-
mon set of models. Our results show that with
word class models, the baseline can be im-
proved by up to 1.4% BLEU and 1.0% TER
on the French→German task and 0.3% BLEU
and 1.1% TER on the German→English task.

1 Introduction

Data sparsity is one of the major problems for statis-
tical learning methods in natural language process-
ing (NLP) today. Even with the huge training data
sets available in some tasks, for many phenomena
that need to be modeled only few training instances
can be observed. This is partly due to the large vo-
cabularies of natural languages. One possiblity to
reduce the sparsity for model estimation is to re-
duce the vocabulary size. By clustering the vocab-
ulary into a fixed number of word classes, it is pos-
sible to train models that are less prone to sparsity
issues. This work investigates the performance of
standard models used in statistical machine transla-

tion when they are trained on automatically learned
word classes rather than the actual word identities.

In the popular tooklit GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003), word classes are an essential ingredient to
model alignment probabilities with the HMM or
IBM translation models. It contains the mkcls tool
(Och, 1999), which can automatically cluster the vo-
cabulary into classes.

Using this tool, we propose to re-parameterize the
standard models used in statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT), which are usually conditioned on word
identities rather than word classes. The idea is that
this should lead to a smoother distribution, which
is more reliable due to less sparsity. Here, we fo-
cus on the phrase-based and lexical channel models
in both directions, simple count models identifying
frequency thresholds, lexicalized reordering models
and an n-gram language model. Although our re-
sults show that it is not a good idea to replace the
original models, we argue that adding them to the
log-linear feature combination can improve transla-
tion quality. They can easily be computed for dif-
ferent translation paradigms and arbitrary models.
Training and decoding is possible without or with
only little change to the code base.

Our experiments are conducted on a medium-
sized French→German task and a small
German→English task and with both phrase-
based and hierarchical phrase-based translation
decoders. By using word class models, we can
improve our respective baselines by 1.4% BLEU and
1.0% TER on the French→German task and 0.3%
BLEU and 1.1% TER on the German→English task.

Training an additional language model for trans-

1377



lation based on word classes has been proposed in
(Wuebker et al., 2012; Mediani et al., 2012; Koehn
and Hoang, 2007). In addition to the reduced spar-
sity, an advantage of the smaller vocabulary is that
longer n-gram context can be modeled efficiently.

Mathematically, our idea is equivalent to a special
case of the Factored Translation Models proposed
by Koehn and Hoang (2007). We will go into more
detail in Section 4. Also related to our work, Cherry
(2013) proposes to parameterize a hierarchical re-
ordering model with sparse features that are condi-
tioned on word classes trained with mkcls. How-
ever, the features are trained with MIRA rather than
estimated by relative frequencies.

2 Word Class Models

2.1 Standard Models

The translation model of most phrase-based and hi-
erarchical phrase-based SMT systems is parameter-
ized by two phrasal and two lexical channel models
(Koehn et al., 2003) which are estimated as relative
frequencies. Their counts are extracted heuristically
from a word aligned bilingual training corpus.

In addition to the four channel models, our base-
line contains binary count features that fire, if the
extraction count of the corresponding phrase pair is
greater or equal to a given threshold τ . We use the
thresholds τ = {2, 3, 4}.

Our phrase-based baseline contains the hierarchi-
cal reordering model (HRM) described by Galley
and Manning (2008). Similar to (Cherry et al.,
2012), we apply it in both translation directions
with separate scaling factors for the three orientation
classes, leading to a total of six feature weights.

An n-gram language model (LM) is another im-
portant feature of our translation systems. The
baselines apply 4-gram LMs trained by the SRILM
toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with interpolated modified
Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).
The smaller vocabulary size allows us to efficiently
model larger context, so in addition to the 4-gram
LM, we also train a 7-gram LM based on word
classes. In contrast to an LM of the same size trained
on word identities, the increase in computational re-
sources needed for translation is negligible for the
7-gram word class LM (wcLM).

2.2 Training
By replacing the words on both source and target
side of the training data with their respective word
classes and keeping the word alignment unchanged,
all of the above models can easily be trained con-
ditioned on word classes by using the same training
procedure as usual. We end up with two separate
model files, usually in the form of large tables, one
with word identities and one with classes. Next, we
sort both tables by their word classes. By walking
through both sorted tables simultaneously, we can
then efficiently augment the standard model file with
an additonal feature (or additional features) based on
word classes. The word class LM is directly passed
on to the decoder.

2.3 Decoding
The decoder searches for the best translation given
a set of models hm(eI1, s

K
1 , f

J
1 ) by maximizing the

log-linear feature score (Och and Ney, 2004):

êÎ1 = arg max
I,eI1

{
M∑

m=1

λmhm(e
I
1, s

K
1 , f

J
1 )

}
, (1)

where fJ1 = f1 . . . fJ is the source sentence, e
I
1 =

e1 . . . eI the target sentence and sK1 = s1 . . . sK the
hidden alignment or derivation.

All the above mentioned models can easily be in-
tegrated into this framework as additional features
hm. The feature weights λm are tuned with mini-
mum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003).

3 Experiments

3.1 Data
Our experiments are performed on a
French→German task. In addition to some
project-internal data, we train the system on the data
provided for the WMT 2012 shared task1. Both the
dev and the test set are composed of a mixture
of broadcast news and broadcast conversations
crawled from the web and have two references.
Table 1 shows the data statistics.

To confirm our results we also run experiments
on the German→English task of the IWSLT 2012
evaluation campaign2.

3.2 Setup

In the French→German task, our baseline is a stan-
dard phrase-based system augmented with the hier-
archical reordering model (HRM) described in Sec-
tion 2.1. The language model is a 4-gram LM
trained on all German monolingual sources provided
for WMT 2012. For the class-based models, we
run mkcls on the source and target side of the
bilingual training data to cluster the vocabulary into
100 classes each. This clustering is used to train
the models described above for word classes on the
same training data as their counterparts based on
word identity. This also holds for the wcLM, which
is a 4-gram LM trained on the same data as the base-
line LM. Further, the smaller vocabulary allows us
to build an additional wcLM with a 7-gram context
length. On this task we also run additional experi-
ments with 200 and 500 classes.

On the German→English task, we evaluate our
method for both a standard phrase-based and the hi-
erarchical phrase-based baseline. Again, the phrase-
based baseline contains the HRM model. As bilin-
gual training data we use the TED talks, which we
cluster into 100 classes on both source and target
side. The 4-gram LM is trained on the TED, Eu-
roparl and news-commentary corpora. On this data
set, we directly use a 7-gram wcLM.

In all setups, the feature weights are optimized
with MERT. Results are reported in BLEU (Pap-
ineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006),
confidence level computation is based on (Koehn,
2004). Our experiments are conducted with the open
source toolkit Jane (Wuebker et al., 2012; Vilar et
al., 2010).

3.3 Results

Results for the French→German task are given in
Table 2. In a first set of experiments we replaced one
of the standard TM, LM and HRM models by the
same model based on word classes. Unsurprisingly,
this degrades performance with different levels of
severity. The strongest degradation can be seen
when replacing the TM, while replacing the HRM
only leads to a small drop in performance. However,
when the word class models are added as additional
features to the baseline, we observe improvements.
The wcTM yields 0.3% BLEU and 0.5% TER on
test. By adding the 4-gram wcLM, we get another
0.3% BLEU and the wcHRM shows further improve-
ments of 0.5% BLEU and 0.2% TER. Extending the
context length of the wcLM to 7-grams gives an ad-
ditional boost, reaching a total gain over the baseline
of 1.4% BLEU and 1.0% TER. Using 200 classes
instead of 100 seems to perform slightly better on
test, but with 500 classes, translation quality de-
grades again.

On the German→English task, the results shown
in Table 3 are similar in TER, but less pronounced
in BLEU. Here we are able to improve over the
phrase-based baseline by 0.3% BLEU and 1.1% TER

the 7-gram wcLM.

4 Equivalence to Factored Translation

Koehn and Hoang (2007) propose to integrate differ-
ent levels of annotation (e.g. morphologial analysis)
as factors into the translation process. Here, the sur-
face form of the source word is analyzed to produce
the factors, which are then translated and finally the
surface form of the target word is generated from the
target factors. Although the translations of the fac-
tors operate on the same phrase segmentation, they
are assumed to be independent. In practice this is
done by phrase expansion, which generates a joint
phrase table as the cross product from the phrase ta-
bles of the individual factors.

In contrast, in this work each word is mapped to
a single class, which means that when we have se-
lected a translation option for the surface form, the
target side on the word class level is predetermined.
Thus, no phrase expansion or generation steps are
necessary to incorporate the word class information.
The phrase table can simply be extended with addi-
tional scores, keeping the set of phrases constant.

Although the implementation is simpler, our ap-
proach is mathematically equivalent to a special
case of the factored translation framework, which is
shown in Figure 1. The generation step from target
word e to its target class c(e) assigns all probability

5 Conclusion

We have presented a simple and very easy to im-
plement method to make use of word clusters for
improving machine translation quality. It is appli-
cable across different paradigms and for arbitrary
types of models. Depending on the model type,
it requires little or no change to the training and
decoding software. We have shown the efficacy
of this method on two translation tasks and with
both the standard phrase-based and the hierarchi-
cal phrase-based translation paradigm. It was ap-
plied to relative frequency translation probabilities,
the n-gram language model and a hierarchical re-
ordering model. In our experiments, the baseline
is improved by 1.4% BLEU and 1.0% TER on the
French→German task and by 0.3% BLEU and 1.1%
TER on the German→English task.

In future work we plan to apply our method to a
wider range of languages. Intuitively, it should be
most effective for morphologically rich languages,
which naturally have stronger sparsity problems.
