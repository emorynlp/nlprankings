Abstract

This paper describes experiments for statistical dependency parsing using two different parsers
trained on a recently extended dependency treebank for Greek, a language with a moderately rich
morphology. We show how scores obtained by the two parsers are influenced by morphology and
dependency types as well as sentence and arc length. The best LAS obtained in these experiments
was 80.16 on a test set with manually validated POS tags and lemmas.

1 Introduction

This work describes experiments for statistical dependency parsing using a recently extended dependency
treebank for Greek, a language with a moderately rich morphology. Relatively small training resources
like the one we use here can set severe sparsity obstacles for languages with flexible word order and
a relatively rich morphology like Greek. This work presents ongoing efforts for evaluating ways of
improving this situation. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: We describe the treebank and
the tools for preprocessing it in section 2. After mentioning some relevant work, we present in section 4
different settings for experiments involving manually validated and automatically pre-processed data for
morphology and lemmas. In section 5we include a comparison of the output of twowell-known statistical
parsers in reference to a set of criteria. Section 6 describes work on using sentences from relatively large
auto-parsed resources as additional training data.

2 Treebank

We use the Greek Dependency Treebank (Prokopidis et al., 2005) for all experiments. GDT includes
texts from open-content sources and from corpora collected in the framework of research projects aiming
at multilingual, multimedia information extraction. A first version of the GDT (GDT-2007) contained
70223 tokens and 2902 sentences, and it was used in the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency Pars-
ing (Nivre et al., 2007a). A recently extended version of the resource (henceforth GDT-2014) amounts
to 130753 tokens (including punctuation) and 5668 sentences. The current version of the resource con-
tains 21827 unique types, 11005 lemmas and 10348 hapax legomena (excluding dates, digits and proper
names). The average sentence length is 23.07 tokens. GDT consists of 249 whole documents and can thus
be used for the annotation of other, possibly inter-sentential, relations like coreference. Each document
has 22.76 sentences on average.
The dependency-based annotation scheme used for the syntactic layer of the GDT is based on an adap-

tation of the guidelines for the Prague Dependency Treebank (Böhmová et al., 2003), and allows for
intuitive representations of long-distance dependencies and non-configurational structures common in
languages with flexible word order. Most trees are headed by a word that bears the Pred relation to an
artificial root node. Other tokens depending on this root node include sentence-final punctuation marks

and coordinating conjunctions. Coordinating conjunctions and apposition markers head participating to-
kens in relevant constructions. Table 1 contains some of the most common dependency relations used in
the treebank, while Figure 1 presents a sentence fragment that contains a non-projective arc connecting
the verb of a complement clause and its extraposed argument. In GDT-2014, 12.86% of the trees include
at least one non-projective arc.
The relatively free word order of Greek can be inferred when examining typical head-dependent struc-

tures in the resource. Although nouns are almost always preceded by determiners and adjectives, the
situation is different for arguments of verbs. Of the 5414 explicit subjects in GDT, 31% occur to the
right of their parent. The situation is more straightforward for non-pronominal objects, of which only
4% occur to the left of their head. Of those subjects and objects appearing in “non-canonical” positions,
21% and 31%, respectively, are of neuter gender. This fact can pose problems to parsing, since the case
of nominative and accusative neuter homographs is particularly difficult to disambiguate, especially due
to the fact that articles and adjectives often preceding them (e.g. το/the κόκκινο/red βιβλίο/book) are also
invariant for these two case values.

Table 1: Common dependency relations in the Greek Dependency Treebank

Apart from the addition of new material, another difference from previous versions is that GDT-2014
sentences have been manually validated for POS, morphosyntactic features and lemmas. The tagset used
contains 584 combinations of basic POS tags (Table 2) and features that capture the rich morphology
of the Greek language. As an example, the full tag AjBaMaSgNm for a word like ταραχώδης/turbulent
denotes an adjective of basic degree, masculine gender, singular number and nominative case. The three
last features are also used for nouns, articles, pronouns, and passive participles. Verb tags include features
for tense and aspect, while articles are distinguished for definiteness.
Manual annotation at these levels allows to examine how the parser’s accuracy is affected in realistic,

automatic pre-processing scenarios. In these settings, POS tagging is conducted with a tagger (Papa-
georgiou et al., 2000) trained on a manually annotated corpus of Greek texts amounting to 455K tokens.
During automatic processing, the tagger assigns to each token the most frequent tag in a lexicon compiled
from the training corpus. A list of suffixes guides initial tagging of unknown words. When all tokens
have been assigned a tag, a set of about 800 contextual rules learned during training, is applied to correct
initial decisions. The tagger’s accuracy reaches 97.49 when only basic POS is considered. When all
features (including, for example, gender and case for nouns, and aspect and tense for verbs) are taken
into account, the tagger’s accuracy drops to 92.54. As an indication of the relatively rich morphology of
Greek, the tags/word ratio in the tagger’s lexicon is 1.82. Tags for a word typically differ in only one or
two features like case and gender for adjectives. However, distinct basic parts of speech (e.g. Vb/No) is
also a possibility.
Following POS tagging, a lemmatizer retrieves lemmas from a lexicon containing 66K lemmas, which

91



in their expanded form extend the lexicon to approximately 2M different entries. When a token under
examination is associated in the lexicon with two or more lemmas, the lemmatizer uses information from
the POS tags to disambiguate. For example, the token+POS input εξετάσεις/VbMn guides the lemma-
tizer to retrieve the lemma εξετάζω (examine), while the lemma εξέταση (examination) is returned for
εξετάσεις/NoCm.

POS Description POS Description
Ad Adverb AsPpPa Prep. + Article combination
AjBa Adjective (basic degree) CjCo Coordinating conjunction
AsPpSp Preposition CjSb Subordinating conjunction
AtDf Definite article NoCm Common noun
AtId Indefinite article PnPo Possessive pronoun
VbMn Finite verb PnRe Relative pronoun

3 Relevant work

Nakagawa (2007) was the best system in parsing the GDT in the CoNLL 2007 shared task, showing a
76.31 Labeled Attachment Score. Nakagawa’s two-stage parser first constructed unlabeled dependency
structures using sentence and token features, and then labeled the arcs using SVMs. The second best
score for Greek was Hall et al. (2007), who scored 74.65 LAS using an ensemble system combining the
output of six different Maltparser configurations. In recent work discussing the cube-pruned dependency
parsing framework, Zhang and McDonald (2014) report a 78.45 LAS on the CoNLL dataset.

4 Experiments

In this section, we report on experiments using statistical parsers trained on automatically preprocessed
and manually validated versions of GDT-2014. In all experiments we report the Labeled and Unlabeled
Attachment Scores (LAS and UAS) and the Label Accuracy (LACC), with punctuation tokens counting
as scoring tokens. We split the data of GDT-2014 in 90% and 10% training and test sets (5,101/567
sentences; 117,581/13,172 tokens). In this partitioning scheme, unknown tokens and lemmas when pars-
ing the test set are 27% and 16%, respectively. We performed experiments with the transition-based
Maltparser (Nivre et al., 2007b) and the graph-based Mateparser (Bohnet, 2010). For Maltparser, a 5-
fold cross validation on the training set using MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012) resulted in
the selection of the non-projective stacklazy parsing algorithm as the one yielding an average best 78.96
LAS. Table 3 provides an abbreviated overview of the selected feature model, which is dominated by the
top and first three elements in the parser’s stack and its lookahead list. For Mateparser we used default
settings.
Table 4 summarizes the results of our experiments. We observe a better 79.74 LAS with Mateparser

with a larger difference in UAS than in LACC (2.37 vs 1.26). This may suggest that the two parsers
agree on the labels they assign but differ more in discovering node heads. Not surprisingly, testing in
a more realistic scenario of using automatic PoS, features and lemmas produces more errors (Figure 2).
Maltparser shows a relatively smaller decrease in accuracy (-3.05 vs -3.45) in this context. In the next
two experiments with Mateparser, we see that in automatic pre-processing scenarios, the tagger clearly
contributes more to error increase (-3.34) compared to the lemmatizer (-0.06).
We also trained Mateparser in the MPL setting with POS tagsets of varying granularity, by remov-

ing features that were intuitively deemed to increase sparsity without contributing to parsing accuracy.
More specifically, we experimented with several combinations of removing for aspect and tense of verbs,
gender of nominal elements, definiteness of articles and degree of adjectives. A best LAS of 80.16 (cf.
the two final columns of Table 4) was observed after removing features for degree and definiteness.
Finally, and in order to examine how the expansion of the treebank has affected performance, we also

5 Error analysis

In this section we first provide a comparative analysis of errors by the two parsers on the 567 sentences
test set. We use the set of length and linguistic factors proposed in the comparison between the Malt
and MST parsers in McDonald and Nivre (2007). For example, in Figure 3, we plot sentence length in
bins of size 10 and show, as expected, that the accuracy of both parsers decreases when analyzing longer
sentences. Maltparser shows a higher accuracy for sentences of size up to 10, possibly because when
parsing shorter sentences, early mistakes when making greedy decisions based on local features do not
have a chance to lead to large error propagation. We omit details on UAS, where a similar pattern is
observed. Figure 4 shows that Mateparser achieves better harmonic means of precision and recall, when
longer dependencies are examined. This is again consistent with the fact that Maltparser favors shorter

arcs when making decisions based on local features only. We have seen that both parsers exhibit low
F1-scores (Malt: 0.36; Mate: 0.30) in detecting non-projective heads.

In Figure 5 we see that Mate’s LAS is better for all basic parts of speech. The difference is more
evident for verbs, which are typically involved in longer dependencies. Finally, it is clear from Figure
6 that certain relations are particularly difficult for both parsers. For example, indirect object (IObj)
dependents are low scoring nodes: this is because they are often attached to the correct head but are
mislabeled as adverbial dependents (Adv) or plain objects (Obj). Dependents labeled as ellipsis (ExD) or
heading appositional (Apos) constructions are also more error-prone. The same applies to nodes involved
in coordinate structures as subjects headed by coordinative conjuctions (Sb_Co). The latter show an
almost 0.3 drop in F1-score in comparison to simple subjects (Sb).

In the APL setting, errors by both parsers often involve some type of interaction between the rela-
tively free order of Greek sentences and the case feature of nominal homographs. For example, in the
case of the sentence Διαφορετικά/different στοιχεία/figures δίνουν/provide τρεις/three επίσημες/official
πηγές/sources για/on την/the ανεργία/unemployment (Three official sources provide different figures on
unemployment), the two nominal arguments of the verb and all of their modifiers are ambiguous as far as
case (Nominative/Accusative) is concerned. Both nominal arguments also agree with the verb in number.
These facts, in combination with the OVS order of this and similar fragments present serious challenges
to both the tagger and the parsers. In contrast, the case of the noun ανεργία/unemployment is easier for the
tagger to disambiguate based on the preposition+article combination preceding it. However, attaching
the whole subtree headed by the preposition is also problematic: it is part of a non-projective construction
that would probably be disallowed in languages with a more strict order.

6 Use of autoparsed data

Following recent efforts in exploiting automatically processed data in training (Chen et al., 2012) and in
accelerating treebank creation (Lynn et al., 2012), we conducted an experiment in extending the training
set with similar material. We used a corpus of 66 million tokens, obtained by crawling (Papavassiliou et
al., 2013) the 2009-2012 online archive of a Greek daily newspaper. We used models induced in theMPL
experiment to parse all documents in the data pool with both parsers. We then appended to the original
training set 30K randomly selected parsed sentences of 10 to 30 tokens length, for which identical trees
were generated by both parsers. After retraining both parsers and testing on the APL test set, we observed
(columns 8 and 9 of table 4) absolute LAS improvements of 0.68 and 0.52 for Maltparser andMateparser.

7 Conclusions and future work

We described a set of experiments for dependency parsing of Greek using Maltparser and Mateparser,
two well known representatives of the transition and graph-based families of parsers. Mateparser has
exhibited the best accuracy on the test partition of a recently expanded version of the Greek Dependency
Treebank, with Maltparser yielding higher scores on shorter sentences. After appending auto-parsed data
to a training set manually validated for POS and lemmas, we observed small accuracy improvements that
show room for improvement.
Scores obtained by training on datasets of different sizes in Section 4 probably indicate that apart from

adding only documents or document fragments to the treebank, we should also consider selecting specific
sentences for annotation, after measuring their informativeness and representativeness. In ongoing work,
we are investigating ways of selecting sentences for manual annotation based on how much two or more
parsers disagree, in combination with criteria like number of coordination/subordination elements and/or
number of OOV words. For this purpose, we will also experiment with more members of the two parser
families.
Our best LAS scores were obtained after mapping certain morphological features to default values.

Since these tagset mappings may not be the most efficient ones, we plan to investigate automatic tech-
niques for selecting optimal feature combinations.
Another line of research will be investigating semi-automatically mapping to different annotation

schemes like the one proposed in McDonald et al. (2013). Finally, we plan to examine, as an additional
source for resource expansion and domain adaptation, sentences from automatic dialogue transcriptions
and/or product reviews.
