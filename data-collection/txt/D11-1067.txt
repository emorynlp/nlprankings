Abstract

Multiword expressions (MWE), a known nui-

sance for both linguistics and NLP, blur the

lines between syntax and semantics. Previous

work on MWE identification has relied primar-

ily on surface statistics, which perform poorly

for longer MWEs and cannot model discontin-

uous expressions. To address these problems,

we show that even the simplest parsing mod-

els can effectively identify MWEs of arbitrary

length, and that Tree Substitution Grammars

achieve the best results. Our experiments show

a 36.4% F1 absolute improvement for French

over an n-gram surface statistics baseline, cur-
rently the predominant method for MWE iden-

tification. Our models are useful for several

NLP tasks in which MWE pre-grouping has

improved accuracy.

1 Introduction

Multiword expressions (MWE) have long been a

challenge for linguistic theory and NLP. There is

no universally accepted definition of the term, but

MWEs can be characterized as “idiosyncratic inter-

pretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)”

(Sag et al., 2002) such as traffic light, or as “fre-

quently occurring phrasal units which are subject

to a certain level of semantic opaqueness, or non-

compositionality” (Rayson et al., 2010).

MWEs are often opaque fixed expressions, al-

though the degree to which they are fixed can vary.

Some MWEs do not allow morphosyntactic varia-

tion or internal modification (e.g., in short, but *in

shorter or *in very short). Other MWEs are “semi-

fixed,” meaning that they can be inflected or undergo

internal modification. The type of modification is of-

ten limited, but not predictable, so it is not possible

to enumerate all variants (Table 1).

French English

à terme in the near term

à court terme in the short term

à très court terme in the very short term

à moyen terme in the mediumterm

à long terme in the long term

à très long terme in the very long term

Table 1: Semi-fixed MWEs in French and English. The

French adverb à terme ‘in the end’ can be modified by

a small set of adjectives, and in turn some of these ad-

jectives can be modified by an adverb such as très ‘very’.

Similar restrictions appear in English.

Merging known MWEs into single tokens has

been shown to improve accuracy for a variety of

NLP tasks: dependency parsing (Nivre and Nilsson,

2004), constituency parsing (Arun and Keller, 2005),

sentence generation (Hogan et al., 2007), and ma-

chine translation (Carpuat and Diab, 2010). Most ex-

periments use gold MWE pre-grouping or language-

specific resources like WordNet. For unlabeled text,

the best MWE identification methods, which are

based on surface statistics (Pecina, 2010), suffer

from sparsity induced by longer n-grams (Ramisch
et al., 2010). A dilemma thus exists: MWE knowl-

edge is useful, but MWEs are hard to identify.

In this paper, we show the effectiveness of statis-

tical parsers for MWE identification. Specifically,

Tree Substitution Grammars (TSG) can achieve a

36.4% F1 absolute improvement over a state-of-the-

art surface statistics method. We choose French,

which has pervasive MWEs, for our experiments.

Parsing models naturally accommodate discontinu-

ous MWEs like phrasal verbs, and provide syntac-

tic subcategorization. By contrast, surface statistics

methods are usually limited to binary judgements for

contiguous n-grams or dependency bigrams.

gories in the FTB (training set). MWEs account for 7.08%

of the bracketings and 13.0% of the tokens in the treebank.

Only 21% of the MWEs occur once (“single”).

We first introduce a new instantiation of the

French Treebank that, unlike previous work, does not

use gold MWE pre-grouping. Consequently, our ex-

perimental results also provide a better baseline for

parsing raw French text.

2 French Treebank Setup

The corpus used in our experiments is the French

Treebank (Abeillé et al. (2003), version from June

2010, hereafter FTB). In French, there is a linguis-

tic tradition of lexicography which compiles lists

of MWEs occurring in the language. For exam-

ple, Gross (1986) shows that dictionaries contain

about 1,500 single-word adverbs but that French con-

tains over 5,000 multiword adverbs. MWEs occur

in every part-of-speech (POS) category (e.g., noun

trousse de secours ‘first-aid kit’; verb faire main-

basse [do hand-low] ‘seize’; adverb comme dans du

beurre [as in butter] ‘easily’; adjective ‘à part en-

tière’ ‘wholly’).

The FTB explicitly annotates MWEs (also called

compounds in prior work). We used the subset of

the corpus with functional annotations, not for those

annotations but because this subset is known to be

more consistently annotated. POS tags for MWEs

are given not only at the MWE level, but also inter-

nally: most tokens that constitute an MWE also have

a POS tag. Table 2 compares this part of the FTB to

the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank.

2.1 Preprocessing

The FTB requires significant pre-processing prior to

parsing.

Tokenization We changed the default tokenization

for numbers by fusing adjacent digit tokens. For ex-

ample, 500 000 is tagged as an MWE composed of

two words 500 and 000. We made this 500000 and

retained the MWE POS, although we did not mark

the new token as an MWE. For consistency, we used

one token for punctuated numbers like “17,9”.

MWE Tagging We marked MWEs with a flat

bracketing in which the phrasal label is the MWE-

level POS tag with an “MW” prefix, and the preter-

minals are the internal POS tags for each terminal.

The resulting POS sequences are not always unique

to MWEs: they appear in abundance elsewhere in

the corpus. However, some MWEs contain normally

ungrammatical POS sequences (e.g., adverb à la va

vite ‘in a hurry’: P D V ADV [at the goes quick]), and

some words appear only as part of an MWE, such as

insu in à l’insu de ‘to the ignorance of’.

Labels We augmented the basic FTB label set—

which contains 14 POS tags and 19 phrasal tags—in

two ways. First, we added 16 finer-grained POS tags

for punctuation.1 Second, we added the 11 MWE

1Punctuation tag clusters—as used in the WSJ—did not im-

prove accuracy. Enriched tag sets like that of Crabbé and Can-

dito (2008) could also be investigated and compared to our re-

sults since Evalb is insensitive to POS tags.

labels shown in Table 3, resulting in 24 total phrasal

categories.

Corrections Historically, the FTB suffered from

annotation errors such as missing POS and phrasal

tags (Arun and Keller, 2005). We found that this

problem has been largely resolved in the current re-

lease. However, 1,949 tokens and 36 MWE spans

still lacked tags. We restored the labels by first as-

signing each token its most frequent POS tag else-

where in the treebank, and then assigning the most

frequent MWE phrasal category for the resulting

POS sequence.2

Split We used the 80/10/10 split described by

Crabbé and Candito (2008). However, they used a

previous release of the treebank with 12,531 trees.

3,391 trees have been added to the present version.

We appended these extra trees to the training set, thus

retaining the same development and test sets.

2.2 Comparison to Prior FTB Representations

Our pre-processing approach is simple and auto-

matic3 unlike the three major instantiations of the

FTB that have been used in previous work:

Arun-Cont and Arun-Exp (Arun and Keller,

2005): Two instantiations of the full 20,000 sentence

treebank that differed principally in their treatment of

MWEs: (1) Cont, in which the tokens of each MWE

were concatenated into a single token (en moyenne

→ en_moyenne); (2) Exp, in which they were marked
with a flat structure. For both representations, they

also gave results in which coordinated phrase struc-

tures were flattened. In the published experiments,

they mistakenly removed half of the corpus, believ-

ing that the multi-terminal (per POS tag) annotations

of MWEs were XML errors (Schluter and Genabith,

2007).

MFT (Schluter and Genabith, 2007): Manual revi-

sion to 3,800 sentences. Major changes included co-

ordination raising, an expanded POS tag set, and the

273 of the unlabeled word types did not appear elsewhere

in the treebank. All but 11 of these were nouns. We manually

assigned the correct tags, but we would not expect a negative

effect by deterministically labeling all of them as nouns.

(Levy and Andrew, 2006). Our pre-processing package is avail-

able at http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml.

correction of annotation errors. Like Arun-Cont,

MFT contains concatenated MWEs.

FTB-UC (Candito and Crabbé, 2009): An in-

stantiation of the functionally annotated section that

makes a distinction between MWEs that are “syn-

tactically regular” and those that are not. Syntacti-

cally regular MWEs were given internal structure,

while all other MWEs were concatenated into sin-

gle tokens. For example, nouns followed by ad-

jectives, such as loi agraire ‘land law’ or Union

monétaire et économique ‘monetary and economic

Union’ were considered syntactically regular. They

are MWEs because the choice of adjective is arbi-

trary (loi agraire and not *loi agricole, similarly to

‘coal black’ but not *‘crow black’ for example), but

their syntactic structure is not intrinsic to MWEs.

In such cases, FTB-UC gives the MWE a conven-

tional analysis of an NP with internal structure. Such

analysis is indeed sufficient to recover the mean-

ing of these semantically compositional MWEs that

are extremely productive. On the other hand, the

FTB-UC loses information about MWEs with non-

compositional semantics.

Almost all work on the FTB has followed Arun-

Cont and used gold MWE pre-grouping. As a result,

most results for French parsing are analogous to early

results for Chinese, which used gold word segmen-

tation, and Arabic, which used gold clitic segmenta-

tion. Candito et al. (2010) were the first to acknowl-

edge and address this issue, but they still used FTB-

UC (with some pre-grouped MWEs). Since the syn-

tax and definition of MWEs is a contentious issue,

we take a more agnostic view—which is consistent

with that of the FTB annotators—and leave them to-

kenized. This permits a data-oriented approach to

MWE identification that is more robust to changes

to the status of specific MWE instances.

To set a baseline prior to grammar development,

we trained the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning,

2003) with no grammar features, achieving 74.2%

labeled F1 on the development set (sentences ≤ 40
words). This is lower than the most recent results ob-

tained by Seddah (2010). However, the results are

not comparable: the data split was different, they

made use of morphological information, and more

importantly they concatenated MWEs. The focus of

727



our work is on models and data representations that

enable MWE identification.

3 MWEs in Lexicon-Grammar

The MWE representation in the FTB is close to

the one proposed in the Lexicon-Grammar (Gross,

1986). In the Lexicon-Grammar, MWEs are classi-

fied according to their global POS tags (noun, verb,

adverb, adjective), and described in terms of the se-

quence of the POS tags of the words that constitute

the MWE (e.g., “N de N” garde d’enfant [guard of

child] ‘daycare’, pied de guerre [foot of war] ‘at the

ready’). In other words, MWEs are represented by a

flat structure. The Lexicon-Grammar distinguishes

between units that are fixed and have to appear as is

(en tout et pour tout [in all and for all] ‘in total’) and

units that accept some syntactic variation such as ad-

mitting the insertion of an adverb or adjective, or the

variation of one of the words in the expression (e.g.,

a possessive as in ‘from the top of one’s hat’). It also

notes whether the MWE displays some selectional

preferences (e.g., it has to be preceded by a verb or

by an adjective).

Our FTB instantiation is largely consistent with

the Lexicon-Grammar. Recall that we defined differ-

ent MWE categories based on the global POS. We

now detail three of the categories.

MWN The MWN category consists of proper

nouns (1a), foreign common nouns (1b), as well as

common nouns. The common nouns appear in sev-

eral syntactically regular sequences of POS tags (2).

Multiword nouns allow inflection (singular vs. plu-

ral) but no insertion.

(1) a. London Sunday Times, Los Angeles

b. week - end, mea culpa, joint - venture

(2) a. N A: corps médical ‘medical staff’, dette

publique ‘public debt’

b. N P N: mode d’emploi ‘instruction man-

ual’

c. N N: numéro deux ‘number two’, mai-

son mère [house mother] ‘headquarters’,

grève surprise ‘sudden strike’

d. N P D N: impôt sur le revenu ‘income

tax’, ministre de l’économie ‘finance

minister’

MWA Multiword adjectives appear with different

POS sequences (3). They include numbers such as

vingt et unième ‘21st’. Some items in (3b) allow in-

ternal variation: some adverbs or adjectives can be

added to both examples given (à très haut risque, de

toute dernière minute).

(3) a. P N: d’antan [from before] ‘old’, en

question ‘under discussion’

b. P A N: à haut risque ‘high-risk’, de

dernière minute [from the last minute]

‘at the eleventh hour’

c. A C A: pur et simple [pure and simple]

‘straightforward’, noir et blanc ‘black

and white’

MWV Multiword verbs also appear in several POS

sequences (4). All verbs allow number and tense in-

flections. Some MWVs containing a noun or an ad-

jective allow the insertion of a modifier (e.g., don-

ner grande satisfication ‘give great satisfaction’),

whereas others do not. When an adverb intervenes

between the main verb and its complement, the FTB

marks the two parts of the MWV discontinuously

(e.g., [MWV [V prennent]] [ADV déjà] [MWV [P en] [N
cause]] ‘already take into account’).

(4) a. V N: avoir lieu ‘take place’, donner sat-

isfaction ‘give satisfaction’

b. V P N: mettre en place ‘put in place’,

entrer en vigueur ‘to come into effect’

c. V P ADV: mettre à mal [put at bad]

‘harm’, être à même [be at same] ‘be

able’

d. V D N P N: tirer la sonnette d’alarme

‘ring the alarm bell’, avoir le vent en

poupe ‘to have the wind astern’

4 Parsing Models

We develop two parsers for French with the goal

of improving MWE identification. The first is a

manually-annotated grammar that we incorporate

into the Stanford parser. Manual annotation results in

human interpretable grammars that can inform future

treebank annotation decisions. Moreover, the gram-

mar can be used as the base distribution in our sec-

ond model, a Probabilistic Tree Substitution Gram-

mar (PTSG) parser. PTSGs learn parameters for tree

fragments larger than basic CFG rules. PTSG rules

may also be lexicalized. This means that commonly

observed collocations—some of which are MWEs—

can be stored in the grammar.

4.1 Stanford Parser

We configure the Stanford parser with settings that

are effective for other languages: selective parent an-

notation, lexicon smoothing, and factored parsing.

We use the head-finding rules of Dybro-Johansen

(2004), which we find to yield an approximately

1.0% F1 development set improvement over those of

Arun (2004). Finally, we include a simple unknown

word model consisting entirely of surface features:

- Nominal, adjectival, verbal, adverbial, and plu-

ral suffixes

- Contains a digit or punctuation

- Is capitalized (except the first word in a sen-

tence)

- Consists entirely of capital letters

- If none of the above, add a one- or two-character

suffix

Combined with the grammar features, this unknown

word model yields 97.3% tagging accuracy on the

development set.

4.1.1 Grammar Development

Table 4 lists the symbol refinements used in our

grammar. Most of the features are POS splits as

many phrasal tag splits did not lead to any improve-

ment. Parent annotation of POS tags (tagPA) cap-

tures information about the external context. mark-

Inf and markPart accomplish a finite/nonfinite dis-

tinction: they respectively specify whether the verb

is an infinitive or a participle based on the type of

the grandparent node. markVN captures the notion

of verbal distance as in Klein and Manning (2003).

We opted to keep the COORD phrasal tag, and

to capture parallelism in coordination, we mark CO-

ORD with the type of its child (NP, AP, VPinf, etc.).

markDe identifies the preposition de and its variants

(du, des, d’) which is very frequent and appears in

several different contexts. markP identifies preposi-

tions which introduce PPs modifying a noun. Mark-

ing other kinds of prepositional modifiers (e.g., verb)

did not help. markMWE adds an annotation to sev-

eral MWE categories for frequently occuring POS

sequences. For example, we mark MWNs that occur

more than 600 times (e.g., “N P N” and “N N”).

4.2 DP-TSG Parser

A shortcoming of CFG-based grammars is that they

do not explicitly capture idiomatic usage. For exam-

ple, consider the two utterances:

(5) a. He [MWV kicked the bucket] .

b. He [VP kicked [NP the pail]] .

The examples in (5) may be equally probable and re-

ceive the same analysis under a PCFG; words are

generated independently. However, recall that in

our representation, (5a) should receive a flat analysis

as MWV, whereas (5b) should have a conventional

analysis of the verb kicked and its two arguments.

An alternate view of parsing is one in which new

utterances are built from previously observed frag-

ments. This is the original motivation for data ori-

ented parsing (DOP) (Bod, 1992), in which “id-

iomaticity is the rule rather than the exception”

(Scha, 1990). If we have seen the collocation kicked

the bucket several times before, we should store that

whole fragment for later use.

We consider a variant of the non-parametric PTSG

model of Cohn et al. (2009) in which tree fragments

are drawn from a Dirichlet process (DP) prior.4

The DP-TSG can be viewed as a DOP model with

Bayesian parameter estimation. A PTSG is a 5-tuple

〈V,Σ, R,♦,θ〉 where c ∈ V are non-terminals;
4Similar models were developed independently by

O’Donnell et al. (2009) and Post and Gildea (2009).

that z = (b,x), and as such z = 〈c, e〉.

t ∈ Σ are terminals; e ∈ R are elementary trees;5
♦ ∈ V is a unique start symbol; and θc,e ∈ θ are
parameters for each tree fragment. A PTSG deriva-

tion is created by successively applying the substitu-

tion operator to the leftmost frontier node (denoted

by c+). All other nodes are internal (denoted by c−).
In the supervised setting, DP-TSG grammar ex-

traction reduces to a segmentation problem. We have

a treebank T that we segment into the set R, a pro-
cess that we model with Bayes’ rule:

p(R | T ) ∝ p(T | R) p(R) (1)
Since the tree fragments completely specify each

tree, p(T | R) is either 0 or 1, so all work is per-
formed by the prior over the set of elementary trees.

The DP-TSG contains a DP prior for each c ∈ V
(Table 5 defines further notation). We generate 〈c, e〉
tuples as follows:

θc|c, αc, P0(·|c) ∼ DP (αc, P0)
e|θc ∼ θc

The data likelihood is given by the latent state z and

the parameters θ: p(z|θ) = ∏z∈z θ

ing out the parameters, we have:

Sites (1) and (2) above have the same type since t(z, s1) =
t(z, s2). However, the two sites conflict since the prob-
abilities of setting bs1 and bs2 both depend on counts for
the tree fragment rooted at NP. Consequently, sites (1) and

(2) are not exchangeable: the probabilities of their assign-

ments depend on the order in which they are sampled.

ford parser.6,7 After applying the manual state splits,

we perform simple right binarization, collapse unary

rules, and replace rare words with their signatures

(Petrov et al., 2006).

For each non-terminal type c, we learn a stop prob-
ability sc ∼ Beta(1, 1). Under P0, the probability of
generating a rule A+ → B− C+ composed of non-
terminals is

P0(A
+ → B− C+) = pMLE(A → B C)sB(1−sC)

(3)

For lexical insertion rules, we add a penalty propor-

tional to the frequency of the lexical item:

P0(c → t) = pMLE(c → t)p(t) (4)
where p(t) is equal to the MLE unigram probabil-
ity of t in the treebank. Lexicalizing a rule makes it
very specific, so we generally want to avoid lexical-

ization with rare words. Empirically, we found that

this penalty reduces overfitting.

Type-based Inference Algorithm To learn the pa-

rameters θ we use the collapsed, block Gibbs sam-
pler of Liang et al. (2010). We sample binary vari-

ables bs associated with each non-terminal node/site
in the treebank. The key idea is to select a block

of exchangeable sites S of the same type that do not
conflict (Figure 1). Since the sites in S are exchange-
able, we can set bS randomly so long as we know m,
the number of sites with bs = 1. Because this algo-
rithm is a not a contribution of this paper, we refer

the reader to Liang et al. (2010).

6The Stanford parser is a product model, so the results in §5.1

include the contribution of a dependency parser.
7Bansal and Klein (2010) also experimented with symbol re-

finement in an all-fragments (parametric) TSG for English.

730



After each Gibbs iteration, we sample each sc di-
rectly using binomial-Beta conjugacy. We re-sample

the DP concentration parameters αc with the auxil-
iary variable procedure of West (1995).

Decoding We compute the rule score of each tree

fragment from a single grammar sample as follows:

θc,e =
nc,e(z) + αcP0(e|c)

nc,·(z) + αc
(5)

To make the grammar more robust, we also include

all CFG rules in P0 with zero counts in n. Scores for
these rules follow from (5) with nc,e(z) = 0.

For decoding, we note that the derivations of a

TSG are a CFG parse forest (Vijay-Shanker and Weir,

1993). As such, we can use a Synchronous Context

Free Grammar (SCFG) to translate the 1-best parse

to its derivation. Consider a unique tree fragment ei
rooted at X with frontier γ, which is a sequence of
terminals and non-terminals. We encode this frag-

ment as an SCFG rule of the form

[X → γ , X → i, Y1, . . . , Yn] (6)

where Y1, . . . , Yn is the sequence of non-terminal
nodes in γ.8 During decoding, the input is re-
written as a sequence of tree fragment (rule) indices

{i, j, k, . . . }. Because the TSG substitution operator
always applies to the leftmost frontier node, we can

deterministically recover the monolingual parse with

top-down re-writes of ♦.
The SCFG formulation has a practical benefit: we

can take advantage of the heavily-optimized SCFG

decoders for machine translation. We use cdec

(Dyer et al., 2010) to recover the Viterbi derivation

under a DP-TSG grammar sample.

5 Experiments

We evaluate parsing accuracy of the Stanford and

DP-TSG models (Table 6). For comparison, we also

include the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006).9

For the DP-TSG, we initialized all bs with fair coin
tosses and ran for 400 iterations, after which likeli-

hood stopped improving.

Table 6: Standard parsing experiments (test set, sentences

Berkeley and DP-TSG results are the average of three in-

dependent runs.

We report two different parsing metrics. Evalb

is the standard labeled precision/recall metric.10

Leaf Ancestor measures the cost of transforming

guess trees to the reference (Sampson and Babar-

czy, 2003). It was developed in response to the non-

terminal/terminal ratio bias of Evalb, which penal-

izes flat treebanks like the FTB. The range of the

score is between 0 and 1 (higher is better). We report

micro-averaged (whole corpus) and macro-averaged

(per sentence) scores.

In terms of parsing accuracy, the Berkeley parser

exceeds both Stanford and DP-TSG. This is consis-

tent with previous experiments for French by Sed-

dah et al. (2009), who show that the Berkeley parser

outperforms other models. It also matches the or-

dering for English (Cohn et al., 2010; Liang et al.,

2010). However, the standard baseline for TSG mod-

els is a simple parent-annotated PCFG (PA-PCFG).

For English, Liang et al. (2010) showed that a similar

DP-TSG improved over PA-PCFG by 4.2% F1. For

French, our gain is a more substantial 8.2% F1.

5.2 MWE Identification Experiments

Table 7 lists overall and per-category MWE identifi-

cation results for the parsing models. Although DP-

TSG is less accurate as a general parsing model, it is

more effective at identifying MWEs.

The predominant approach to MWE identification

is the combination of lexical association measures

(surface statistics) with a binary classifier (Pecina,

2010). A state-of-the-art, language independent

package that implements this approach for higher

order n-grams is mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al.,
2010).11 In Table 8 we compare DP-TSG to both

6 Discussion

Automatic learning methods run the risk of produc-

ing uninterpretable models. However, the DP-TSG

model learns useful generalizations over MWEs. A

sample of the rules is given in Table 9. Some spe-

cific sequences like “[MWN [coup de N]]” are part of

the grammar: such rules can indeed generate quite

a few MWEs, e.g., coup de pied ‘kick’, coup de

coeur, coup de foudre ‘love at first sight’, coup de

main ‘help’, coup d’état, coup de grâce (note that

only some of these MWEs are seen in the training

configuration details.

data). For MWV, “V de N” as in avoir de cesse ‘give

no peace’, perdre de vue [lose from sight] ‘forget’,

prendre de vitesse [take from speed] ‘outpace’), is

learned. For prepositions, the grammar stores full

subtrees of MWPs, but can also generalize the struc-

ture of very frequent sequences: “en N de” occurs in

many multiword prepositions (e.g., en compagnie de,

en face de, en matière de, en terme de, en cours de,

en faveur de, en raison de, en fonction de). The TSG

grammar thus provides a categorization of MWEs

consistent with the Lexicon-Grammar. It also learns

verbal phrases which contain discontinuous MWVs

due to the insertion of an adverb or negation such as

“[VN [MWV va] [MWADV d’ailleurs] [MWV bon train]]”

[go indeed well], “[VN [MWV a] [ADV jamais] [MWV
été question d’]]” [has never been in question].

A significant fraction of errors for MWNs occur

with adjectives that are not recognized as part of the

MWE. For example, since établissements privés ‘pri-

vate corporation’ is unseen in the training data, it is

not found. Sometimes the parser did not recognize

the whole structure of an MWE. Figure 2 shows an

example where the parser only found a subpart of the

MWN tour de passe-passe ‘magic trick’.

Other DP-TSG errors are due to inconsistencies in

the FTB annotation. For example, sous prétexte que

Figure 3: Example of an inconsistent FTB annotation for

sous prétexte que ‘on the pretext of’.

‘on the pretext of’ is tagged as both MWC and as a

regular PP structure (Figure 3). However, the parser

always assigns a MWC structure, which is a better

analysis than the gold annotation. We expect that

more consistent annotation would help the DP-TSG

more than the CFG-based parsers.

The DP-TSG is not immune to false positives: in

Le marché national, fait-on remarquer, est enfin en

régression . . . ‘The national economy, people at last

note, is going down’ the parser tags marché national

as MWN. As noted, the boundary of what should and

should not count as an MWE can be fuzzy, and it is

therefore hard to assess whether or not this should be

an MWE. The FTB does not mark it as one.

There are multiple examples were the DP-TSG

found the MWE whereas Stanford (its base distribu-

tion) did not, such as in Figure 4. Note that the “N

P N” structure is quite frequent for MWNs, but the

TSG correctly identifies the MWADV in emplois à

domicile [jobs at home] ‘homeworking’.

7 Related Work

There is a voluminous literature on MWE identi-

fication. Here we review closely related syntax-

based methods.12 The linguistic and computa-

tional attractiveness of lexicalized grammars for

modeling idiosyncratic constructions in French was

identified by Abeillé (1988) and Abeillé and Sch-

abes (1989). They manually developed a small

Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) of 1,200 elemen-

tary trees and 4,000 lexical items that included

MWEs. The classic statistical approach to MWE

identification, Xtract (Smadja, 1993), used an in-

12See Seretan (2011) for a comprehensive survey of syntax-

based methods for MWE identification. For an overview of n-
gram methods like mwetoolkit, see Pecina (2010).

cremental parser in the third stage of its pipeline

to identify predicate-argument relationships. Lin

(1999) applied information-theoretic measures to

automatically-extracted dependency relations to find

MWEs. To our knowledge, Wehrli (2000) was the

first to use syntactically annotated corpora to im-

prove a parser for MWE identification. He pro-

posed to rank analyses of a symbolic parser based

on the presence of collocations, although details of

the ranking function were not provided.

The most similar work to ours is that of Nivre

and Nilsson (2004), who converted a Swedish cor-

pus into two versions: one in which MWEs were

left as tokens, and one in which they were merged.

On the first version, they showed that a deterministic

dependency parser could identify MWEs at 71.1%

F1, albeit without subcategory information. On

the second version—which simulated perfect MWE

identification—they showed that labeled attachment

improved by about 1%.

Recent statistical parsing work on French has in-

cluded Stochastic Tree Insertion Grammars (STIGs),

which are related to TAGs, but with a restricted ad-

junction operation.13 Seddah et al. (2009) and Sed-

dah (2010) showed that STIGs underperform CFG-

based parsers on the FTB. In their experiments,

MWEs were concatenated.

13TSGs differ from TAGs and STIGs in that they do not in-

clude an adjunction operator.

8 Conclusion

The main result of this paper is that an existing sta-

tistical parser can achieve a 36.4% F1 absolute im-

provement for MWE identification over a state-of-

the-art n-gram surface statistics package. Parsers
also provide syntactic subcategorization, and do not

require pre-filtering of the training data. We have

also demonstrated that TSGs can capture idiomatic

usage better than a PCFG. While the DP-TSG, which

is a relatively new parsing model, still lags state-of-

the-art parsers in terms of overall labeling accuracy,

we have shown that it is already very effective for

other tasks like MWE identification. We plan to im-

prove the DP-TSG by experimenting with alternate

parsing objectives (Cohn et al., 2010), lexical rep-

resentations, and parameterizations of the base dis-

tribution. A particularly promising base distribution

is the latent variable PCFG learned by the Berkeley

parser. However, initial experiments with this distri-

bution were negative, so we leave further develop-

ment to future work.

We chose French for these experiments due to the

pervasiveness of MWEs and the availability of an an-

notated corpus. However, MWE lists and syntactic

treebanks exist for many of the world’s major lan-

guages. We will investigate automatic conversion of

these treebanks (by flattening MWE bracketings) for

MWE identification.

A.1 Notes on the Rising Factorial

The rising factorial—also known as the ascending

factorial or Pochhammer symbol—arises in the con-

text of samples from a Dirichlet process (see Prop.

3 of Antoniak (1974) for details). For a positive in-

teger n and a complex number x, the rising factorial
xn is defined14 by

xn = x(x+ 1) . . . (x+ n− 1)

=

n∏

j=1

(x+ j − 1) (7)

The rising factorial can be generalized to a com-

plex number α with the gamma function:

xα =
Γ(x+ α)

Γ(x)

14We adopt the notation of Knuth (1992).

where x0 ≡ 1.
In our type-based sampler, we computed (7) di-

rectly in a dynamic program. We found that (8) was

prohibitively slow for sampling.

A.2 mwetoolkit Configuration

We configured mwetoolkit15 with the four stan-

dard lexical features: the maximum likelihood esti-

mator, Dice’s coefficient, pointwise mutual informa-

tion (PMI), and Student’s t-score. We added the POS
sequence for each n-gram as a single feature. We re-
moved the web counts features to make the experi-

ments comparable. To compensate for the absence

of web counts, we computed the lexical features us-

ing the gold lemmas from the FTB instead of using

an automatic lemmatizer.

Since MWE n-grams only account for a small
fraction of the n-grams in the corpus, we filtered the
training and test sets by removing all n-grams that
occurred once. To further balance the proportion of

MWEs, we trained on all valid MWEs plus 10x ran-

domly selected non-MWE n-grams. This proportion
matches the fraction of MWE/non-MWE tokens in

the FTB. Since we generated a random training set,

we reported the average of three independent runs.

We created feature vectors for the training n-
grams and trained a binary Support Vector Machine

(SVM) classifier with Weka (Hall et al., 2009). Al-

though mwetoolkit defaults to a linear kernel,

we achieved higher accuracy on the development set

with an RBF kernel.

The FTB is sufficiently large for the corpus-based

methods implemented in mwetoolkit. Ramisch

et al. (2010)’s experiments were on Genia, which

contains 18k sentences and 490k tokens, similar to

the FTB. Their test set had 895 sentences, smaller

than ours. They reported 30.6% F1 for their task

against an Xtract baseline, which only obtained 7.3%

F1. These results are comparable in magnitude to our

FTB results.
