Abstract
We present the DFKI hybrid translation sys-
tem at the WMT workshop 2011. Three SMT
and two RBMT systems are combined at the
level of the final translation output. The trans-
lation results show that our hybrid system sig-
nificantly outperformed individual systems by
exploring strengths of both rule-based and sta-
tistical translations.

1 Introduction

Machine translation (MT), in particular the statisti-
cal approach to it, has undergone incremental im-
provements in recent years. While rule-based ma-
chine translation (RBMT) maintains competitive-
ness in human evaluations. Combining the advan-
tages of both approaches have been investigated by
many researchers such as (Eisele et al., 2008).
Nonetheless, significant improvements over statis-
tical approaches still remain to be shown. In this
paper, we present the DFKI hybrid system in the
WMT workshop 2011. Our system is different from
the system of the last year (Federmann et al., 2010),
which is based on the shallow phrase substitution.
In this work, two rule-based translation systems are
applied. In addition, three statistical machine trans-
lation systems are built, including a phrase-based,
a hierarchical phrase-based and a syntax-based sys-
tem. Instead of combining with rules or post-editing,
we perform system combination on the final transla-
tion hypotheses. We applied the CMU open toolkit
(Heafield and Lavie, 2010) among numerous com-
bination methods such as (Matusov, 2009), (Sim et
al., 2007) and (He et al., 2008). The final transla-
tion output outperforms each individual output sig-
nificantly.

2 Individual translation systems

2.1 Phrase-based system
We use the IBM model 1 and 4 (Brown et al., 1993)
and Hidden-Markov model (HMM) (Vogel et al.,
1996) to train the word alignment using the mgiza
toolkit1. We applied the EMS in Moses (Koehn et
al., 2007) to build up the phrase-based translation
system. Features in the log-linear model include
translation models in two directions, a language
model, a distortion model and a sentence length
penalty. A dynamic programming beam search al-
gorithm is used to generate the translation hypoth-
esis with maximum probability. We applied a 5-
gram mixture language model with each sub-model
trained on one fifth of the monolingual corpus with
Kneser-Ney smoothing using SRILM toolkit (Stol-
cke, 2002). We did not perform any tuning, because
it hurts the evaluation performance in our experi-
ments.

2.2 Syntax-based system
To capture the syntactic structure, we also built a
tree-based system using the same configuration of
EMS in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Tree-based
models operate on so-called grammar rules, which
include variables in the mapping rules. To increase
the diversity of models in combination, the lan-
guage model in each individual translation system
is trained differently. For the tree-based system,
we applied a 4-gram language model with Kneser-
Ney smoothing using SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002)
trained on the whole monolingual corpus. The
test2007 news part is applied to tune the feature
weights using mert, because the tuning on test2007

improves the translation performance more than the
tuning on test2008 in a small-scale experiment for
the tree-based system.

2.3 Hierarchical phrase-based system

For the hierarchical system, we used the open source
hierarchical phrased-based system Jane, developed
at RWTH and free for non-commercial use (Vi-
lar et al., 2010). This approach is an extension
of the phrase-based approach, where the phrases
are allowed to have gaps (Chiang, 2007). In this
way long-range dependencies and reorderings can
be modeled in a consistent statistical framework.

The system uses a fairly standard setup, trained
using the bilingual data provided by the organizers,
word aligned using the mgiza. Two 5-gram language
models were used during decoding: one trained on
the monolingual part of the bilingual training data,
and a larger one trained on the additional news data.
Decoding was carried out using the cube pruning al-
gorithm. The tuning is performed on test2008 with-
out further experiments.

2.4 Rule-based systems

We applied two rule-based translation systems, the
Lucy system (Lucy, 2011) and the Linguatec sys-
tem (Aleksić and Thurmair, 2011). The Lucy sys-
tem is a recent offspring of METAL. The Linguatec
system is a modular system consisting of grammar,
lexicon and morphological analyzers based on logic
programming using slot grammar.

3 Hybrid translation

A hybrid approach combining rule-based and sta-
tistical machine translation is usually investigated
with an in-box integration, such as multi-way trans-
lation (Eisele et al., 2008), post-editing (Ueffing et
al., 2008) or noun phrase substitution (Federmann
et al., 2010). However, significant improvements
over state-of-the-art statistical machine translation
are still expected. In the meanwhile system combi-
nation methods for instance described in (Matusov,
2009), (Sim et al., 2007) and (He et al., 2008) are
mostly evaluated to combine statistical translation
systems, rule-based systems are not considered. In
this work, we integrate the rule-based and statistical
machine translation system on the level of the final

translation hypothesis and treat the rule-based sys-
tem anonymously as an individual system. In this
way an black-box integration is allowed using the
current system combination techniques.

We applied the CMU open toolkit (Heafield
and Lavie, 2010) MEMT, a package by Kenneth
Heafield to combine the translation hypotheses. The
language model is trained on the target side of the
parallel training corpus using SRILM (Stolcke,
2002). We used only the Europarl part to train lan-
guage models for tuning and all target side of paral-
lel data to train language models for decoding. The
beam size is set to 80, and 300 nbest is considered.

4 Translation experiments

4.1 MT Setup

The parallel training corpus consists of 1.8
million German-English parallel sentences from
Europarl-v6 (Koehn, MT Summit 2005) and news-
commentary with 48 million tokenized German
words and 54 million tokenized English words re-
spectively. The monolingual training corpus con-
tains the target side of the parallel training cor-
pus and the additional monolingual language model
training data downloaded from (SMT, 2011). We
did not apply the large-scale Gigaword corpus, be-
cause it does not significantly reduce the perplexity
of our language model but raises the computational
requirement heavily.

4.2 Single systems

For each individual translation system, different
configurations are experimented to achieve a higher
translation quality. We take phrase- and syntax-
based translation system as examples. Table 1

DFKI in 2010. In 2010’s translation system only
Europarl parallel corpus was applied, and the trans-
lation output was evaluated as 18.32% in the BLEU
score. In 2011, we added the News Commentary
parallel corpus and trained the language model on all
monolingual data provided by (SMT, 2011) except
for Gigaword. As shown in Table 1, if we increase
the maximum sentence length of the training cor-
pus from 80 to 100, the BLEU score increases from
20.65% to 20.78%. In the error analysis, we found
that many OOVs come from the compound words
in German. Therefore, we applied the compound
splitting for both German and English by activating
the corrensponding settings in the EMS in Moses.
This leads to a further improvement of nearly 1%
in the BLEU score. As we add the new parallel
corpus provided on the homepage of SMT work-
shop in 2011 (SMT, 2011) to the corpus in 2010,
a slight improvement can be achieved. Within one
year, the score for the DFKI PBT system DE-EN has
improved by nearly 3.5% absolute and 20% relative
BLEU score points, as shown in Table 1.

In the phrase-based translation, the tuning was not
applied, because it improves the results on the held-
out data but hurts the results on the evaluation set.
In our observation, the decrease is in the range of
0.01% to 1% in the BLEU score. However tun-
ing does help for the Tree-based system. Therefore
we applied the test2007 to optimize the parameters,
which enhanced the BLEU score from 17.52% to
21.10%. The compound splitting also improves the
syntax system, with about 1% in the BLEU score.
We did not add the new parallel corpus into the train-
ing for syntax system due to its larger computational
requirement than that of the phrase-based system.

4.3 Hybrid system

We applied test10 as the held-out data to tune
the German-English and English-German transla-
tion systems. For experiments, we applied a small-
scaled 4-gram language model trained only on the
target side of the Europarl parallel training data. As
shown in Table 2, different combinations are per-
formed on the hypotheses generated from single sys-
tems. We first combined the PBT with syntax sys-
tem, then together with the HPBT system. The
translation result in the BLEU score performs best
when we combine all three statistical machine trans-
lation systems and two rule-based systems together.

4.4 Evaluation results

For the decoding during the WMT evaluation, we
applied a larger 4-gram language model trained on
the target side of all parallel training corpus. As
shown in Table 3, in last year’s evaluation the DFKI
hybrid translation result was evaluated as 17.34% in
the BLEU score. In 2011, among all the transla-
tion systems, the syntax system performs the best
on test10 and test11, while the PBT performs the

best on test08. The rule-based sytems, Linguatec
and Lucy are expected to have a higher score in the
human evaluation than in the automatic evaluation.
Furthermore, as we can see from Table 3, there is
still room to improve the Jane system, with better
modeling, configurations or even higher-order lan-
guage model. Using the hybrid system we success-
fully improved the translation result to 23.88% on
test10. The hybrid system outperforms the best sin-
gle system by 0.43% and 0.76% in the BLEU score
on the test08 and test11, respectively.

For the translation from English to German, the
translation result of last year’s submission was eval-
uated as 14.42% in the BLEU score, as shown in Ta-
ble 4. In this year, the phrase-based translation result
is 15.46% in the BLEU score. We only set up one
statistical translation system due to time limitation.
With the respect of the BLEU score, phrase-based
translation outperforms rule-based translations. Be-
tween rule-based translation systems, Linguatec per-
forms better on the test10 (14.92%) and Lucy per-
forms better on the test11 (13.0%). Combining three
translation hypotheses leads to a smaller improve-
ment (from 15.46% to 15.55%) on the test10 and a
greater improvement (from 14.05% to 15.83%) on
the test11 in the BLEU score over the single best
translation system. Comparing to last year’s trans-
lation output, the improvement is over one percent
absolutely (from 14.42% to 15.55%) in the BLEU
score on the test10.

4.5 Output examples
Table 5 shows two translation examples from the
MT output of the test2011. We list the source sen-
tence in German and its reference translation as
well as the translation results generated by different
translation systems. As can be seen from Table 5,
the translation quality of source sentences is greatly
improved using the hybrid system over the single in-
dividual systems. Translations of words and word
orderings are more appropriate by the hybrid sys-
tem.

5 Conclusion and future work

We presented the DFKI hybrid translation system
submitted in the WMT workshop 2011. The hy-
brid translation is performed on the final translation
output by individual systems, including a phrase-
based system, a syntax-based system, a hierarchical
phrase-based system and two rule-based systems.
Combining the results from statistical and rule-
based systems significantly improved the translation
performance over the single-best system, which is
shown by the automatic evaluation scores and the
output examples. Despite of the encouraging results,
there is still room to improve our system, such as the
tuning in the phrase-based translation and a better
language model in the combination.
