Abstract

We propose methods for estimating the prob-
ability that an entity from an entity database
is associated with a web search query. Asso-
ciation is modeled using a query entity click
graph, blending general query click logs with
vertical query click logs. Smoothing tech-
niques are proposed to address the inherent
data sparsity in such graphs, including inter-
polation using a query synonymy model. A
large-scale empirical analysis of the smooth-
ing techniques, over a 2-year click graph
collected from a commercial search engine,
shows significant reductions in modeling er-
ror. The association models are then applied
to the task of recommending products to web
queries, by annotating queries with products
from a large catalog and then mining query-
product associations through web search ses-
sion analysis. Experimental analysis shows
that our smoothing techniques improve cover-
age while keeping precision stable, and over-
all, that our top-performing model affects 9%
of general web queries with 94% precision.

1 Introduction

Commercial search engines use query associations
in a variety of ways, including the recommendation
of related queries in Bing, ‘something different’ in
Google, and ‘also try’ and related concepts in Ya-
hoo. Mining techniques to extract such query asso-
ciations generally fall into four categories: (a) clus-
tering queries by their co-clicked url patterns (Wen
et al., 2001; Baeza-Yates et al., 2004); (b) leveraging
co-occurrences of sequential queries in web search

query sessions (Zhang and Nasraoui, 2006; Boldi et
al., 2009); (c) pattern-based extraction over lexico-
syntactic structures of individual queries (Paşca and
Durme, 2008; Jain and Pantel, 2009); and (d) distri-
butional similarity techniques over news or web cor-
pora (Agirre et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 2009). These
techniques operate at the surface level, associating
one surface context (e.g., queries) to another.

In this paper, we focus instead on associating sur-
face contexts with entities that refer to a particu-
lar entry in a knowledge base such as Freebase,
IMDB, Amazon’s product catalog, or The Library
of Congress. Whereas the former models might as-
sociate the string “Ronaldinho” with the strings “AC
Milan” or “Lionel Messi”, our goal is to associate
“Ronaldinho” with, for example, the Wikipedia en-
tity page “wiki/AC Milan” or the Freebase entity
“en/lionel mess”. Or for the query string “ice fish-
ing”, we aim to recommend products in a commer-
cial catalog, such as jigs or lures.

The benefits and potential applications are large.
By knowing the entity identifiers associated with a
query (instead of strings), one can greatly improve
both the presentation of search results as well as
the click-through experience. For example, consider
when the associated entity is a product. Not only
can we present the product name to the web user,
but we can also display the image, price, and re-
views associated with the entity identifier. Once the
entity is clicked, instead of issuing a simple web
search query, we can now directly show a product
page for the exact product; or we can even perform
actions directly on the entity, such as buying the en-
tity on Amazon.com, retrieving the product’s oper-

83



ating manual, or even polling your social network
for friends that own the product. This is a big step
towards a richer semantic search experience.

In this paper, we define the association between a
query string q and an entity id e as the probability
that e is relevant given the query q, P (e|q). Fol-
lowing Baeza-Yates et al. (2004), we model rele-
vance as the likelihood that a user would click on
e given q, events which can be observed in large
query-click graphs. Due to the extreme sparsity
of query click graphs (Baeza-Yates, 2004), we pro-
pose several smoothing models that extend the click
graph with query synonyms and then use the syn-
onym click probabilities as a background model.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our smoothing
models, via a large-scale empirical study over real-
world data, which significantly reduce model errors.
We further apply our models to the task of query-
product recommendation. Queries in session logs
are annotated using our association probabilities and
recommendations are obtained by modeling session-
level query-product co-occurrences in the annotated
sessions. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
affect 9% of general web queries with 94% recom-
mendation precision.

2 Related Work

We introduce a novel application of significant com-
mercial value: entity recommendations for general
Web queries. This is different from the vast body
of work on query suggestions (Baeza-Yates et al.,
2004; Fuxman et al., 2008; Mei et al., 2008b; Zhang
and Nasraoui, 2006; Craswell and Szummer, 2007;
Jagabathula et al., 2011), because our suggestions
are actual entities (as opposed to queries or docu-
ments). There is also a rich literature on recom-
mendation systems (Sarwar et al., 2001), including
successful commercial systems such as the Ama-
zon product recommendation system (Linden et al.,
2003) and the Netflix movie recommendation sys-
tem (Bell et al., 2007). However, these are entity-
to-entity recommendations systems. For example,
Netflix recommends movies based on previously
seen movies (i.e., entities). Furthermore, these sys-
tems have access to previous transactions (i.e., ac-
tual movie rentals or product purchases), whereas
our recommendation system leverages a different re-

source, namely query sessions.
In principle, one could consider vertical search

engines (Nie et al., 2007) as a mechanism for as-
sociating queries to entities. For example, if we type
the query “canon eos digital camera” on a commerce
search engine such as Bing Shopping or Google
Products, we get a listing of digital camera entities
that satisfy our query. However, vertical search en-
gines are essentially rankers that given a query, re-
turn a sorted list of (pointers to) entities that are re-
lated to the query. That is, they do not expose actual
association scores, which is a key contribution of our
work, nor do they operate on general search queries.

Our smoothing methods for estimating associ-
ation probabilities are related to techniques de-
veloped by the NLP and speech communities to
smooth n-gram probabilities in language model-
ing. The simplest are discounting methods, such
as additive smoothing (Lidstone, 1920) and Good-
Turing (Good, 1953). Other methods leverage
lower-order background models for low-frequency
events, such as Katz’ backoff smoothing (Katz,
1987), Witten-Bell discounting (Witten and Bell,
1991), Jelinek-Mercer interpolation (Jelinek and
Mercer, 1980), and Kneser-Ney (Kneser and Ney,
1995).

In the information retrieval community, Ponte and
Croft (1998) are credited for accelerating the use
of language models. Initial proposals were based
on learning global smoothing models, where the
smoothing of a word would be independent of the
document that the word belongs to (Zhai and Laf-
ferty, 2001). More recently, a number of local
smoothing models have been proposed (Liu and
Croft, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2004; Tao et al.,
2006). Unlike global models, local models leverage
relationships between documents in a corpus. In par-
ticular, they rely on a graph structure that represents
document similarity. Intuitively, the smoothing of a
word in a document is influenced by the smoothing
of the word in similar documents. For a complete
survey of these methods and a general optimization
framework that encompasses all previous proposals,
please see the work of Mei, Zhang et al. (2008a).
All the work on local smoothing models has been
applied to the prediction of priors for words in docu-
ments. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to establish that query-click graphs can be used to

84



create accurate models of query-entity associations.

3 Association Model

Task Definition: Consider a collection of entities
E. Given a search query q, our task is to compute
P (e|q), the probability that an entity e is relevant to
q, for all e ∈ E.

We limit our model to sets of entities that can
be accessed through urls on the web, such as Ama-
zon.com products, IMDB movies, Wikipedia enti-
ties, and Yelp points of interest.

Following Baeza-Yates et al. (2004), we model
relevance as the click probability of an entity given
a query, which we can observe from click logs of
vertical search engines, i.e., domain-specific search
engines such as the product search engine at Ama-
zon, the local search engine at Yelp, or the travel
search engine at Bing Travel. Clicked results in a
vertical search engine are edges between queries and
entities e in the vertical’s knowledge base. General
search query click logs, which capture direct user
intent signals, have shown significant improvements
when used for web search ranking (Agichtein et al.,
2006). Unlike for general search engines, vertical
search engines have typically much less traffic re-
sulting in extremely sparse click logs.

In this section, we define a graph structure for
recording click information and we propose several
models for estimating P (e|q) using the graph.

3.1 Query Entity Click Graph

We define a query entity click graph, QEC(Q∪U ∪
E,Cu ∪ Ce), as a tripartite graph consisting of a set
of query nodes Q, url nodes U , entity nodes E, and
weighted edges Cu exclusively between nodes of Q
and nodes of U , as well as weighted edges Ce ex-
clusively between nodes of Q and nodes of E. Each
edge in Cu and Ce represents the number of clicks
observed between query-url pairs and query-entity
pairs, respectively. Let wu(q, u) be the click weight
of the edges in Cu, and we(q, e) be the click weight
of the edges in Ce.

IfCe is very large, then we can model the associa-
tion probability, P (e|q), as the maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) of observing clicks on e given the
query q:

P̂mle(e|q) = we(q,e)∑
e′∈E we(q,e

′) (3.1)

Figure 1 illustrates an example query entity
graph linking general web queries to entities in a
large commercial product catalog. Figure 1a illus-
trates eight queries in Q with their observed clicks
(solid lines) with products in E1. Some probabil-
ity estimates, assigned by Equation 3.1, include:
P̂mle(panfish jigs, e1) = 0, P̂mle(ice jigs, e1) = 1,
and P̂mle(ice auger, e4) =

ce(ice auger,e4)
ce(ice auger,e3)+ce(ice auger,e4)

.
Even for the largest search engines, query click

logs are extremely sparse, and smoothing techniques
are necessary (Craswell and Szummer, 2007; Gao et
al., 2009). By considering only Ce, those clicked
urls that map to our entity collection E, the sparsity
situation is even more dire. The sparsity of the graph
comes in two forms: a) there are many queries for
which an entity is relevant that will never be seen
in the click logs (e.g., “panfish jig” in Figure 1a);
and b) the query-click distribution is Zipfian and
most observed edges will have very low click counts
yielding unreliable statistics. In the following sub-
sections, we present a method to expand QEC with
unseen queries that are associated with entities in E.
Then we propose smoothing methods for leveraging
a background model over the expanded click graph.

Throughout our models, we make the simplifying
assumption that the knowledge base E is complete.

3.2 Graph Expansion
Following Gao et al. (2009), we address the spar-
sity of edges in Ce by inferring new edges through
traversing the query-url click subgraph, UC(Q ∪
U,Cu), which contains many more edges than Ce.
If two queries qi and qj are synonyms or near syn-
onyms2, then we expect their click patterns to be
similar.

We define the synonymy similarity, s(qi, qj) as
the cosine of the angle between qi and qj, the click
pattern vectors of qi and qj , respectively:

cosine(qi,qj) =
qi·qj√

qi·qi·
√

qj·qj

where q is an nu dimensional vector consisting of
the pointwise mutual information between q and
each url u in U , pmi(q, u):

1Clicks are collected from a commerce vertical search en-
gine described in Section 5.1.

2A query qi is a near synonym of a query qj if most relevant
results of qi are also relevant to qj . Section 5.2.1 describes our
adopted metric for near synonymy.

Enrichment: We enrich the original QEC graph
by creating a new edge {q′,e}, where q′ ∈ Q and e ∈
E, if there exists a query q where s(q, q′) > ρ and
we(q, e) > 0. ρ is set experimentally, as described
in Section 5.2.

Figure 1b illustrates similarity edges created be-
tween query “ice auger” and both “power auger”
and “d rock”. Since “ice auger” was connected to
entities e3 and e4 in the original QEC, our expan-
sion model creates new edges in Ce between {power
auger, e3}, {power auger, e4}, and {d rock, e3}.

For each newly added edge {q,e}, P̂mle = 0 ac-
cording to our model from Equation 3.1 since we
have never observed any clicks between q and e. In-
stead, we define a new model that uses P̂mle when
clicks are observed and otherwise assigns uniform
probability mass, as:

P̂hybr(e|q) =

 P̂mle(e|q) if ∃e
′|we(q,e′)>0

1∑
e′∈E φ(q,e

′) otherwise
(3.3)

where φ(q, e) is an indicator variable which is 1 if
there is an edge between {q, e} in Ce.

This model does not leverage the local synonymy
graph in order to transfer edge weight to unseen
edges. In the next section, we investigate smooth-
ing techniques for achieving this.

3.3 Smoothing
Smoothing techniques can be useful to alleviate data
sparsity problems common in statistical models. In
practice, methods that leverage a background model
(e.g., a lower-order n-gram model) have shown most
promise (Katz, 1987; Witten and Bell, 1991; Je-
linek and Mercer, 1980; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In
this section, we present two smoothing methods, de-
rived from Jelinek-Mercer interpolation (Jelinek and
Mercer, 1980), for estimating the target association
probability P (e|q).

Figure 1c highlights two edges, illustrated with
dashed lines, inserted into Ce during the graph ex-
pansion phase of Section 3.2. ŵe(q, e) represents
the weight of our background model, which can be
viewed as smoothed click counts, and are obtained

where Nsq =

the smoothed weights, we obtain our background
model, P̂bsim:

P̂bsim(e|q) = ŵe(q,e)∑
e′∈E ŵe(q,e

′) (3.5)

Below we propose two models for interpolating our
foreground model from Equation 3.1 with the back-
ground model from Equation 3.5.

Basic Interpolation: This smoothing model,
P̂intu(e|q), linearly combines our foreground and
background models using a model parameter α:

P̂intu(e|q)=αP̂mle(e|q)+(1−α)P̂bsim(e|q) (3.6)

Bucket Interpolation: Intuitively, edges {q, e} ∈
Ce with higher observed clicks, we(q, e), should be
trusted more than those with low or no clicks. A
limitation of P̂intu(e|q) is that it weighs the fore-
ground and background models in the same way ir-
respective of the observed foreground clicks. Our
final model, P̂intp(e|q) parameterizes the interpola-
tion by the number of observed clicks:

P̂intp(e|q)=α[we(q, e)]P̂mle(e|q)
+ (1− α[we(q, e)])P̂bsim(e|q)

(3.7)

In practice, we bucket the observed click parame-
ter, we(q, e), into eleven buckets: {1-click, 2-clicks,
..., 10-clicks, more than 10 clicks}.

Section 5.2 outlines our procedure for learn-
ing the model parameters for both P̂intu(e|q) and
P̂intp(e|q).

3.4 Summary
Table 1 summarizes the association models pre-
sented in this section as well as a strawman that as-
signs uniform probability to all edges in QEC:

P̂unif (e|q) =
1∑

e′∈E φ(q, e
′)

(3.8)

In the following section, we apply these models
to the task of extracting product recommendations
for general web search queries. A large-scale exper-
imental study is presented in Section 5 supporting
the effectiveness of our models.

4 Entity Recommendation

Query recommendations are pervasive in commer-
cial search engines. Many systems extract recom-
mendations by mining temporal query chains from
search sessions and clickthrough patterns (Zhang
and Nasraoui, 2006). We adopt a similar strategy,
except instead of mining query-query associations,
we propose to mine query-entity associations, where
entities come from an entity database as described in
Section 1. Our technical challenge lies in annotating
sessions with entities that are relevant to the session.

4.1 Product Entity Domain

Although our model generalizes to any entity do-
main, we focus now on a product domain. Specifi-
cally, our universe of entities,E, consists of the enti-
ties in a large commercial product catalog, for which
we observe query-click-product clicks, Ce, from the
vertical search logs. Our QEC graph is completed
by extracting query-click-urls from a search engine’s
general search logs, Cu. These datasets are de-
scribed in Section 5.1.

4.2 Recommendation Algorithm

We hypothesize that if an entity is relevant to a
query, then it is relevant to all other queries co-
occurring in the same session. Key to our method
are the models from Section 3.

Step 1 – Query Annotation: For each query q in a
session s, we annotate it with a set Eq, consisting of
every pair {e, P̂ (e|q)}, where e ∈ E such that there
exists an edge {q, e} ∈ Ce with probability P̂ (e|q).
Note that Eq will be empty for many queries.

Step 2 – Session Analysis: We build a query-
entity frequency co-occurrence matrix, A, consist-
ing of n|Q| rows and n|E| columns, where each row
corresponds to a query and each column to an entity.

87



The value of the cell Aqe is the sum over each ses-
sion s, of the maximum edge weight between any
query q′ ∈ s and e3:

Aqe =
∑

s∈S ψ(s, e)

where S consists of all observed search sessions and:

ψ(s, e) = arg max
P̂ (e|q′)

({e, P̂ (e|q′)} ∈ Eq′),∀q′ ∈ s

Step 3 – Ranking: We compute ranking scores
between each query q and entity e using pointwise
mutual information over the frequencies in A, simi-
larly to Eq. 3.2.

The final recommendations for a query q are ob-
tained by returning the top-k entities e according to
Step 3. Filters may be applied on: f the frequency
Aqe; and p the pointwise mutual information rank-
ing score between q and e.

5 Experimental Results

5.1 Datasets
We instantiate our models from Sections 3 and 4 us-
ing search query logs and a large catalog of prod-
ucts from a commercial search engine. We form
our QEC graphs by first collecting in Ce aggregate
query-click-entity counts observed over two years
in a commerce vertical search engine. Similarly,
Cu is formed by collecting aggregate query-click-url
counts observed over six months in a web search en-
gine, where each query must have frequency at least
10. Three final QEC graphs are sampled by taking
various snapshots of the above graph as follows: a)
TRAIN consists of 50% of the graph; b) TEST con-
sists of 25% of the graph; c) DEV consists of 25%
of the graph.

5.2 Association Models
5.2.1 Model Parameters
We tune the α parameters for P̂intu and P̂intp against
the DEV QEC graph. There are twelve parameters
to be tuned: α for P̂intu and α(1), α(2), ..., α(10),
α(> 10) for P̂intp, where α(x) is the observed
click bucket as described in Section 3.3. For each,
we choose the parameter value that minimizes the
mean-squared error (MSE) of the DEV set, where

tated with entity e in the same session as q occurred.

tion 3.2 on the DEV set and hand-annotated 100 ran-
dom synonymy pairs according to whether or not the
pairs were synonyms 2. Setting ρ = 0.4 results in a
precision > 0.9.

5.2.2 Analysis
We evaluate the quality of our models in Table 1 by
evaluating their mean-squared error (MSE) against
the target P (e|q) computed on the TEST set:

MSE(P̂ )=
∑
{q,e}∈CTe

(PT (e|q)−P̂ (e|q))2

MSEW (P̂ )=
∑
{q,e}∈CTe

wTe (q,e)·(PT (e|q)−P̂ (e|q))2

where CTe are the edges in the TEST QEC graph
with weight wTe (q, e), P

T (e|q) is the target proba-
bility computed over the TEST QEC graph, and P̂
is one of our models trained on the TRAIN QEC
graph. MSE measures against each edge type,
which makes it sensitive to the long tail of the
click graph. Conversely, MSEW measures against
each edge instance, which makes it a good mea-
sure against the head of the click graph. We expect
our smoothing models to have much more impact
on MSE (i.e., the tail) than on MSEW since head
queries do not suffer from data sparsity.

Table 2 lists the MSE and MSEW results for
each model. We consider P̂unif as a strawman and
P̂mle as a strong baseline (i.e., without any graph
expansion nor any smoothing against a background

model). P̂unif performs generally very poorly, how-
ever P̂mle is much better, with an expected estima-
tion error of 0.16 accounting for an MSE of 0.0261.
As expected, our smoothing models have little im-
provement on the head-sensitive metric (MSEW )
relative to P̂mle. In particular, P̂hybr performs nearly
identically to P̂mle on the head. On the tail, all three
smoothing models significantly outperform P̂mle
with P̂intp reducing the error by 18.4%. Table 3 lists
query-product associations for five randomly sam-
pled products along with their model scores from
P̂mle with P̂intp.

Figure 3 provides an intrinsic view into MSE as
a function of the number of observed clicks in the
TEST set. As expected, for larger observed click
counts (>4), all models perform roughly the same,
indicating that smoothing is not necessary. However,
for low click counts, which in our dataset accounts
for over 20% of the overall click instances, we see
a large reduction in MSE with P̂intp outperforming
P̂intu, which in turn outperforms P̂hybr. P̂unif per-
forms very poorly. The reason it does worse as the
observed click count rises is that head queries tend to
result in more distinct urls with high-variance clicks,
which in turn makes a uniform model susceptible to
more error.

Figure 3 illustrates that the benefit of the smooth-
ing models is in the tail of the click graph, which
supports the larger error reductions seen in MSE in
Table 2. For associations only observed once, P̂intp
reduces the error by 29% relative to P̂mle.

We also performed an editorial evaluation of the
query-entity associations obtained with bucket inter-
polation. We created two samples from the TEST
dataset: one randomly sampled by taking click
weights into account, and the other sampled uni-
formly at random. Each set contains results for

100 queries. The former consists of 203 query-
product associations, and the latter of 159 associa-
tions. The evaluation was done using Amazon Me-
chanical Turk4. We created a Mechanical Turk HIT5

where we show to the Mechanical Turk workers the
query and the actual Web page in a Product search
engine. For each query-entity association, we gath-
ered seven labels and considered an association to be
correct if five Mechanical Turk workers gave a pos-
itive label. An association was considered to be in-
correct if at least five workers gave a negative label.
Borderline cases where no label got five votes were
discarded (14% of items were borderline for the uni-
form sample; 11% for the weighted sample). To en-
sure the quality of the results, we introduced 30%
of incorrect associations as honeypots. We blocked
workers who responded incorrectly on the honey-
pots so that the precision on honeypots is 1. The
result of the evaluation is that the precision of the as-
sociations is 0.88 on the weighted sample and 0.90
on the uniform sample.

5.3 Related Product Recommendation

We now present an experimental evaluation of our
product recommendation system using the baseline
model P̂mle and our best-performing model P̂intp.
The goals of this evaluation are to (1) determine
the quality of our product recommendations; and (2)
assess the impact of our association models on the
product recommendations.

5.3.1 Experimental Setup
We instantiate our recommendation algorithm from
Section 4.2 using session co-occurrence frequencies

from a one-month snapshot of user query sessions at
a Web search engine, where session boundaries oc-
cur when 60 seconds elapse in between user queries.
We experiment with the recommendation parame-
ters defined at the end of Section 4.2 as follows: k =
10, f ranging from 10 to 100, and p ranging from 3
to 10.

For each configuration, we report coverage as the
total number of queries in the output (i.e., the queries
for which there is some recommendation) divided by
the total number of queries in the log. For our per-
formance metrics, we sampled two sets of queries:
(a) Query Set Sample: uniform random sam-
ple of 100 queries from the unique queries in the
one-month log; and (b) Query Bag Sample:
weighted random sample, by query frequency, of
100 queries from the query instances in the one-
month log. For each sample query, we pooled to-
gether and randomly shuffled all recommendations
by our algorithm using both P̂mle and P̂intp on each
parameter configuration. We then manually anno-
tated each {query, product} pair as relevant, mildly
relevant or non-relevant. In total, 1127 pairs were
annotated. Interannotator agreement between two
judges on this task yielded a Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen,
1960) of 0.56. We therefore collapsed the mildly
relevant and non-relevant classes yielding two final
classes: relevant and non-relevant. Cohen’s Kappa
on this binary classification is 0.71.

Let CM be the number of relevant (i.e., correct)
suggestions recommended by a configurationM and
let |M | be the number of recommendations returned
by M . Then we define the (micro-) precision of M
as: PM = CMC . We define relative recall (Pantel et
al., 2004) between two configurations M1 and M2
as RM1,M2 =

PM1×|M1|
PM2×|M2|

Table 5: Sample product recommendations.

markable is the {f = 10, p = 10} configuration
where the P̂intp model affected 9.4% of all query
instances posed by the millions of users of a major
search engine, with a precision of 94%. Although
this model covers 0.8% of the unique queries, the
fact that it covers many head queries such as wal-
mart and iphone accounts for the large query in-
stance coverage. Also since there may be many gen-
eral web queries for which there is no appropriate
product in the database, a coverage of 100% is not
attainable (nor desirable); in fact the upper bound
for the coverage is likely to be much lower.

Turning to the impact of the association models
on product recommendations, we note that precision
is stable in our P̂intp model relative to our baseline
P̂mle model. However, a large lift in relative recall
is observed, up to a 19% increase for the {f = 100,
p = 10} configuration. These results are consistent
with those of Section 5.2, which compared the asso-
ciation models independently of the application and
showed that P̂intp outperforms P̂mle.

Table 5 shows sample product recommendations
discovered by our P̂intp model. Manual inspection
revealed two main sources of errors. First, ambiguity
is introduced both by the click model and the graph
expansion algorithm of Section 3.2. In many cases,
the ambiguity is resolved by user click patterns (i.e.,
users disambiguate queries through their browsing
behavior), but one such error was seen for the query
“shark attack videos” where several Shark-branded
vacuum cleaners are recommended. This is because
of the ambiguous query “shark” that is found in the
click logs and in query sessions co-occurring with
the query “shark attack videos”. The second source
of errors is caused by systematic user errors com-
monly found in session logs such as a user acciden-
tally submitting a query while typing. An example

90



session is: {“speedo”, “speedometer”}where the in-
tended session was just the second query and the un-
intended first query is associated with products such
as Speedo swimsuits. This ultimately causes our sys-
tem to recommend various swimsuits for the query
“speedometer”.

6 Conclusion
Learning associations between web queries and
entities has many possible applications, including
query-entity recommendation, personalization by
associating entity vectors to users, and direct adver-
tising. Although many techniques have been devel-
oped for associating queries to queries or queries
to documents, to the best of our knowledge this is
the first that aims to associate queries to entities
by leveraging click graphs from both general search
logs and vertical search logs.

We developed several models for estimating the
probability that an entity is relevant given a user
query. The sparsity of query entity graphs is ad-
dressed by first expanding the graph with query
synonyms, and then smoothing query-entity click
counts over these unseen queries. Our best per-
forming model, which interpolates between a fore-
ground click model and a smoothed background
model, significantly reduces testing error when com-
pared against a strong baseline, by 18%. On associ-
ations observed only once in our test collection, the
modeling error is reduced by 29% over the baseline.

We applied our best performing model to the
task of query-entity recommendation, by analyz-
ing session co-occurrences between queries and an-
notated entities. Experimental analysis shows that
our smoothing techniques improve coverage while
keeping precision stable, and overall, that our top-
performing model affects 9% of general web queries
with 94% precision.
