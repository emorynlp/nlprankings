Abstract

Responding to the need for semantic lexical
resources in natural language processing ap-
plications, we examine methods to acquire
noun compounds (NCs), e.g., orange juice, to-
gether with suitable fine-grained semantic in-
terpretations, e.g., squeezed from, which are
directly usable as paraphrases. We employ
bootstrapping and web statistics, and utilize
the relationship between NCs and paraphras-
ing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such
patterns in multiple alternating iterations. In
evaluation, we found that having one com-
pound noun fixed yields both a higher number
of semantically interpreted NCs and improved
accuracy due to stronger semantic restrictions.

1 Introduction

Noun compounds (NCs) such as malaria mosquito
and colon cancer tumor suppressor protein are chal-
lenging for text processing since the relationship
between the nouns they are composed of is im-
plicit. NCs are abundant in English and understand-
ing their semantics is important in many natural lan-
guage processing (NLP) applications. For example,
a question answering system might need to know
whether protein acting as a tumor suppressor is a
good paraphrase for tumor suppressor protein. Sim-
ilarly, a machine translation system facing the un-
known noun compound Geneva headquarters might
translate it better if it could first paraphrase it as
Geneva headquarters of the WTO. Given a query
for “migraine treatment”, an information retrieval
system could use paraphrasing verbs like relieve and
prevent for query expansion and result ranking.

Most work on noun compound interpretation has
focused on two-word NCs. There have been two
general lines of research: the first one derives the NC
semantics from the semantics of the nouns it is made
of (Rosario and Hearst, 2002; Moldovan et al., 2004;
Kim and Baldwin, 2005; Girju, 2007; Séaghdha,
2009; Tratz and Hovy, 2010), while the second one
models the relationship between the nouns directly
(Vanderwende, 1994; Lapata, 2002; Kim and Bald-
win, 2006; Nakov and Hearst, 2006; Nakov and
Hearst, 2008; Butnariu and Veale, 2008).

In either case, the semantics of an NC is typi-
cally expressed by an abstract relation like CAUSE
(e.g., malaria mosquito), SOURCE (e.g., olive oil),
or PURPOSE (e.g., migraine drug), coming from a
small fixed inventory. Some researchers however,
have argued for a more fine-grained, even infinite,
inventory (Finin, 1980). Verbs are particularly use-
ful in this respect and can capture elements of the
semantics that the abstract relations cannot. For ex-
ample, while most NCs expressing MAKE, can be
paraphrased by common patterns like be made of
and be composed of, some NCs allow more specific
patterns, e.g., be squeezed from for orange juice, and
be topped with for bacon pizza.

Recently, the idea of using fine-grained para-
phrasing verbs for NC semantics has been gain-
ing popularity (Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov,
2008b); there has also been a related shared task at
SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al., 2010). This interest
is partly driven by practicality: verbs are directly us-
able as paraphrases. Still, abstract relations remain
dominant since they offer a more natural generaliza-
tion, which is useful for many NLP applications.

One good contribution to this debate would be a
direct study of the relationship between fine-grained
and coarse-grained relations for NC interpretation.
Unfortunately, the existing datasets do not allow
this since they are tied to one particular granular-
ity; moreover, they only contain a few hundred NCs.
Thus, our objective is to build a large-scale dataset
of hundreds of thousands of NCs, each interpreted
(1) by an abstract semantic relation and (2) by a set
of paraphrasing verbs. Having such a large dataset
would also help the overall advancement of the field.

Since there is no universally accepted abstract re-
lation inventory in NLP, and since we are interested
in NC semantics from both a theoretical and a prac-
tical viewpoint, we chose the set of abstract relations
proposed in the theory of Levi (1978), which is dom-
inant in theoretical linguistics and has been also used
in NLP (Nakov and Hearst, 2008).

We use a two-step algorithm to jointly harvest
NCs and patterns (verbs and prepositions) that in-
terpret them for a given abstract relation. First,
we extract NCs using a small number of seed pat-
terns from a given abstract relation. Then, using
the extracted NCs, we harvest more patterns. This
is repeated until no new NCs and patterns can be
extracted or for a pre-specified number of itera-
tions. Our approach combines pattern-based extrac-
tion and bootstrapping, which is novel for NC in-
terpretation; however, such combinations have been
used in other areas, e.g., named entity recognition
(Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002;
Curran et al., 2007; McIntosh and Curran, 2009).

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 gives an overview of related work,
Section 3 motivates our semantic representation,
Sections 4, 5, and 6 explain our method, dataset and
experiments, respectively, Section 7 discusses the
results, Section 8 provides error analysis, and Sec-
tion 9 concludes with suggestions for future work.

2 Related Work

As we mentioned above, the implicit relation be-
tween the two nouns forming a noun compound can
often be expressed overtly using verbal and prepo-
sitional paraphrases. For example, student loan is
“loan given to a student”, while morning tea can be
paraphrased as “tea in the morning”.

Thus, many NLP approaches to NC semantics
have used verbs and prepositions as a fine-grained
semantic representation or as features when pre-
dicting coarse-grained abstract relations. For ex-
ample, Vanderwende (1994) associated verbs ex-
tracted from definitions in an online dictionary with
abstract relations. Lauer (1995) expressed NC se-
mantics using eight prepositions. Kim and Baldwin
(2006) predicted abstract relations using verbs as
features. Nakov and Hearst (2008) proposed a fine-
grained NC interpretation using a distribution over
Web-derived verbs, prepositions and coordinating
conjunctions; they also used this distribution to pre-
dict coarse-grained abstract relations. Butnariu and
Veale (2008) adopted a similar fine-grained verb-
centered approach to NC semantics. Using a dis-
tribution over verbs as a semantic interpretation was
also carried out in a recent challenge: SemEval-2010
Task 9 (Butnariu et al., 2009; Butnariu et al., 2010).

In noun compound interpretation, verbs and
prepositions can be seen as patterns connecting the
two nouns in a paraphrase. Similar pattern-based ap-
proaches have been popular in information extrac-
tion and ontology learning. For example, Hearst
(1992) extracted hyponyms using patterns such as
X, Y, and/or other Zs, where Z is a hypernym of
X and Y. Berland and Charniak (1999) used sim-
ilar patterns to extract meronymy (part-whole) re-
lations, e.g., parts/NNS of/IN wholes/NNS matches
basements of buildings. Unfortunately, matches are
rare, which makes it difficult to build large semantic
inventories. In order to overcome data sparseness,
pattern-based approaches are often combined with
bootstrapping. For example, Riloff and Jones (1999)
used a multi-level bootstrapping algorithm to learn
both a semantic lexicon and extraction patterns, e.g.,
owned by X extracts COMPANY and facilities in X
extracts LOCATION. That is, they learned seman-
tic lexicons using extraction patterns, and then, al-
ternatively, they extracted new patterns using these
lexicons. They also introduced a second level of
bootstrapping to retain the most reliable examples
only. While the method enables the extraction of
large lexicons, its quality degrades rapidly, which
makes it impossible to run for too many iterations.
Recently, Curran et al. (2007) and McIntosh and
Curran (2009) proposed ways to control degradation
using simultaneous learning and weighting.

649



Bootstrapping has been applied to noun com-
pound extraction as well. For example, Kim and
Baldwin (2007) used it to produce a large number
of semantically interpreted noun compounds from
a small number of seeds. In each iteration, the
method replaced one component of an NC with its
synonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms to generate a
new NC. These new NCs were further filtered based
on their semantic similarity with the original NC.
While the method acquired a large number of noun
compounds without significant semantic drifting, its
accuracy degraded rapidly after each iteration. More
importantly, the variation of the sense pairs was lim-
ited since new NCs had to be semantically similar to
the original NCs.

Recently, Kozareva and Hovy (2010) combined
patterns and bootstrapping to learn the selectional
restrictions for various semantic relations. They
used patterns involving the coordinating conjunction
and, e.g., “* and John fly to *”, and learned argu-
ments such as Mary/Tom and France/New York. Un-
like in NC interpretation, it is not necessary for their
arguments to form an NC, e.g., Mary France and
France Mary are not NCs. Rather, they were in-
terested in building a semantic ontology with a pre-
defined set of semantic relations, similar to YAGO
(Suchanek et al., 2007), where the pattern work for
would have arguments like a company/UNICEF.

3 Semantic Representation

Inspired by (Finin, 1980), Nakov and Hearst (2006)
and (Nakov, 2008b) proposed that NC semantics is
best expressible using paraphrases involving verbs
and/or prepositions. For example, bronze statue is
a statue that is made of, is composed of, consists of,
contains, is of, is, is handcrafted from, is dipped in,
looks like bronze. They further proposed that se-
lecting one such paraphrase is not enough and that
multiple paraphrases are needed for a fine-grained
representation. Finally, they observed that not all
paraphrases are equally good (e.g., is made of is
arguably better than looks like or is dipped in for
MAKE), and thus proposed that the semantics of a
noun compound should be expressed as a distribu-
tion over multiple possible paraphrases. This line of
research was later adopted by SemEval-2010 Task 9
(Butnariu et al., 2010).

It easily follows that the semantics of abstract re-
lations such as MAKE that can hold between the
nouns in an NC can be represented in the same way:
as a distribution over paraphrasing verbs and prepo-
sitions. Note, however, that some NCs are para-
phrasable by more specific verbs that do not nec-
essarily support the target abstract relation. For ex-
ample, malaria mosquito, which expresses CAUSE,
can be paraphrased using verbs like carry, which do
not imply direct causation. Thus, while we will be
focusing on extracting NCs for a particular abstract
relation, we are interested in building semantic rep-
resentations that are specific for these NCs and do
not necessarily apply to all instances of that relation.

Traditionally, the semantics of a noun compound
have been represented as an abstract relation drawn
from a small closed set. Unfortunately, no such set is
universally accepted, and mapping between sets has
proven challenging (Girju et al., 2005). Moreover,
being both abstract and limited, such sets capture
only part of the semantics; often multiple meanings
are possible, and sometimes none of the pre-defined
ones suits a given example. Finally, it is unclear
how useful these sets are since researchers have of-
ten fallen short of demonstrating practical uses.

Arguably, verbs have more expressive power and
are more suitable for semantic representation: there
is an infinite number of them (Downing, 1977), and
they can capture fine-grained aspects of the mean-
ing. For example, while both wrinkle treatment and
migraine treatment express the same abstract rela-
tion TREATMENT-FOR-DISEASE, fine-grained dif-
ferences can be revealed using verbs, e.g., smooth
can paraphrase the former, but not the latter.

In many theories, verbs play an important role in
NC derivation (Levi, 1978). Moreover, speakers of-
ten use verbs to make the hidden relation between
the noun in a noun compound overt. This allows for
simple extraction and for straightforward use in NLP
tasks like textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan,
2005) and machine translation (Nakov, 2008a).

Finally, a single verb is often not enough, and
the meaning is better approximated by a collection
of verbs. For example, while malaria mosquito ex-
presses CAUSE (and is paraphrasable using cause),
further aspects of the meaning can be captured with
more verbs, e.g., carry, spread, be responsible for,
be infected with, transmit, pass on, etc.

4 Method

We harvest noun compounds expressing some target
abstract semantic relation (in the experiments below,
this is Levi’s MAKE2), starting from a small number
of initial seed patterns: paraphrasing verbs and/or
prepositions. Optionally, we might also be given
a small number of noun compounds that instanti-
ate the target abstract relation. We then learn more
noun compounds and patterns for the relation by al-
ternating between the following two bootstrapping
steps, using the Web as a corpus. First, we extract
more noun compounds that are paraphrasable with
the available patterns (see Section 4.1). We then
look for new patterns that can paraphrase the newly-
extracted noun compounds (see Section 4.2). These
two steps are repeated until no new noun compounds
can be extracted or until a pre-determined number of
iterations has been reached. A schematic description
of the algorithm is shown in Figure 1.

4.1 Bootstrapping Step 1: Noun Compound
Extraction

Given a list of patterns (verbs and/or prepositions),
we mine the Web to extract noun compounds that
match these patterns. We experiment with the fol-
lowing three bootstrapping strategies for this step:

• Loose bootstrapping uses the available pat-
terns and imposes no further restrictions.

• Strict bootstrapping requires that, in addition
to the patterns themselves, some noun com-
pounds matching each pattern be made avail-
able as well. A pattern is only instantiated in
the context of either the head or the modifier of
a noun compound that is known to match it.

• NC-only strict bootstrapping is a stricter ver-
sion of strict bootstrapping, where the list of
patterns is limited to the initial seeds.

Below we describe each of the sub-steps of the NC
extraction process: query generation, snippet har-
vesting, and noun compound acquisition & filtering.

4.1.1 Query Generation
We generate generalized exact-phrase queries to

be used in a Web search engine (we use Yahoo!):
"* that PATTERN *" (loose)

"HEAD that PATTERN *" (strict)
"* that PATTERN MOD" (strict)

where PATTERN is an inflected form of a verb, MOD
and HEAD are inflected forms the modifier and the
head of a noun compound that is paraphrasable by
the pattern, that is the word that, and * is the
search engine’s star operator.

We use the first pattern for loose bootstrapping
and the other two for both strict bootstrapping and
NC-only strict bootstrapping.

Note that the above queries are generalizations of
the actual queries we use against the search engine.
In order to instantiate these generalizations, we fur-
ther generate the possible inflections for the verbs
and the nouns involved. For nouns, we produce sin-
gular and plural forms, while for verbs, we vary not
only the number (singular and plural), but also the
tense (we allow present, past, and present perfect).
When inflecting verbs, we distinguish between ac-
tive verb forms like consist of and passive ones like
be made from and we treat them accordingly. Over-
all, in the case of loose bootstrapping, we generate
about 14 and 20 queries per pattern for active and
passive patterns, respectively, while for strict boot-
strapping and NC-only strict bootstrapping, the in-
stantiations yield about 28 and 40 queries for active
and passive patterns, respectively.

651



For example, given the seed be made of, we could
generate "* that were made of *". If we
are further given the NC orange juice, we could also
produce "juice that was made of *" and
"* that is made of oranges".

4.1.2 Snippet Extraction
We execute the above-described instantiations of

the generalized queries against a search engine as
exact phrase queries, and, for each one, we collect
the snippets for the top 1,000 returned results.

4.1.3 NC Extraction and Filtering
Next, we process the snippets returned by the

search engine and we acquire potential noun com-
pounds from them. Then, in each snippet, we look
for an instantiation of the pattern used in the query
and we try to extract suitable noun(s) that occupy the
position(s) of the *.

For loose bootstrapping, we extract two nouns,
one from each end of the matched pattern, while
for strict bootstrapping and for NC-only strict boot-
strapping, we only extract one noun, either preced-
ing or following the pattern, since the other noun
is already fixed. We then lemmatize the extracted
noun(s) and we form NC candidates from the two
arguments of the instantiated pattern, taking into ac-
count whether the pattern is active or passive.

Due to the vast number of snippets we have to
process, we decided not to use a syntactic parser or a
part-of-speech (POS) tagger1; thus, we use heuristic
rules instead. We extract “phrases” using simple in-
dicators such as punctuation (e.g., comma, period),
coordinating conjunctions2 (e.g., and, or), preposi-
tions (e.g., at, of, from), subordinating conjunctions
(e.g., because, since, although), and relative pro-
nouns (e.g., that, which, who). We then extract the
nouns from these phrases, we lemmatize them using
WordNet, and we form a list of NC candidates.

While the above heuristics work reasonably well
in practice, we perform some further filtering, re-
moving all NC candidates for which one or more of
the following conditions are met:

1In fact, POS taggers and parsers are unreliable for Web-
derived snippets, which often represent parts of sentences and
contain errors in spelling, capitalization and punctuation.

2Note that filtering the arguments using such indicators indi-
rectly subsumes the pattern "X PATTERN Y and" proposed
in (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010).

1. the candidate NC is one of the seed examples
or has been extracted on a previous iteration;

2. the head and the modifier are the same;

3. the head or the modifier are not both listed as
nouns in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998);

4. the candidate NC occurs less than 100 times in
the Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus3;

5. the NC is extracted less than N times (we tried
5 and 10) in the context of the pattern for all
instantiations of the pattern.

4.2 Bootstrapping Step 2: Pattern Extraction

This is the second step of our bootstrapping algo-
rithm as shown on Figure 1. Given a list of noun
compounds, we mine the Web to extract patterns:
verbs and/or prepositions that can paraphrase each
NC. The idea is to turn the NC’s pre-modifier into
a post-modifying relative clause and to collect the
verbs and prepositions that are used in such clauses.
Below we describe each of the sub-steps of the NC
extraction process: query generation, snippet har-
vesting, and NC extraction & filtering.

4.2.1 Query Generation

The process of extraction starts with exact-phrase
queries issued against a Web search engine (again
Yahoo!) using the following generalized pattern:

"HEAD THAT? * MOD"

where MOD and HEAD are inflected forms of NC’s
modifier and head, respectively, THAT? stands for
that, which, who or the empty string, and * stands
for 1-6 instances of search engine’s star operator.

For example, given orange juice, we could gen-
erate queries like "juice that * oranges",
"juices which * * * * * * oranges",
and "juices * * * orange".

4.2.2 Snippet Extraction

The same as in Section 4.1.2 above.

4.2.3 Pattern Extraction and Filtering
We split the extracted snippets into sentences, and

filter out all incomplete ones and those that do not
contain (a possibly inflected version of) the target
nouns. We further make sure that the word sequence
following the second mentioned target noun is non-
empty and contains at least one non-noun, thus en-
suring the snippet includes the entire noun phrase.
We then perform shallow parsing, and we extract all
verb forms, and the following preposition, between
the target nouns. We allow for adjectives and partici-
ples to fall between the verb and the preposition but
not nouns; we further ignore modal verbs and aux-
iliaries, but we retain the passive be, and we make
sure there is exactly one verb phrase between the tar-
get nouns. Finally, we lemmatize the verbs to form
the patterns candidates, and we apply the following
pattern selection rules:

1. we filter out all patterns that were provided as
initial seeds or were extracted previously;

2. we select the top 20 most frequent patterns;

3. we filter out all patterns that were extracted less
than N times (we tried 5 and 10) and with less
than M NCs per pattern (we tried 20 and 50).

5 Target Relation and Seed Examples

As we mentioned above, we use the inventory of
abstract relations proposed in the popular theoreti-
cal linguistics theory of Levi (1978). In this theory,
noun compounds are derived from underlying rel-
ative clauses or noun phrase complement construc-
tions by means of two general processes: predicate
deletion and predicate nominalization. Given a two-
argument predicate, predicate deletion removes that
predicate, but retains its arguments to form an NC,
e.g., pie made of apples → apple pie. In contrast,
predicate nominalization creates an NC whose head
is a nominalization of the underlying predicate and
whose modifier is either the subject or the object of
that predicate, e.g., The President refused General
MacArthur’s request. → presidential refusal.

According to Levi, predicate deletion can be ap-
plied to abstract predicates, whose semantics can be
roughly approximated using five paraphrasing verbs
(CAUSE, HAVE, MAKE, USE, and BE) and four
prepositions (IN, FOR, FROM, and ABOUT).

Typically, in predicate deletion, the modifier is
derived from the object of the underlying relative
clause; however, the first three verbs also allow for
it to be derived from the subject. Levi expresses the
distinction using indexes. For example, music box is
MAKE1 (object-derived), i.e., the box makes music,
while chocolate bar is MAKE2 (subject-derived),
i.e., the bar is made of chocolate (note the passive).

Due to time constraints, we focused on one re-
lation of Levi’s, MAKE2, which is among the most
frequent relations an NC can express and is present
in some form in many relation inventories (Warren,
1978; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and
Hearst, 2001; Nastase and Szpakowicz, 2003; Girju
et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2007; Girju et al., 2009;
Hendrickx et al., 2010; Tratz and Hovy, 2010).

In Levi’s theory, MAKE2 means that the head of
the noun compound is made up of or is a product of
its modifier. There are three subtypes of this relation
(we do not attempt to distinguish between them):

(a) the modifier is a unit and the head is a configu-
ration, e.g., root system;

(b) the modifier represents a material and the head
is a mass or an artefact, e.g., chocolate bar;

(c) the head represents human collectives and
the modifier specifies their membership, e.g.,
worker teams.

There are 20 instances of MAKE2 in the appendix
of (Levi, 1978), and we use them all as seed NCs.
As seed patterns, we use a subset of the human-
proposed paraphrasing verbs and prepositions cor-
responding to these 20 NCs in the dataset in (Nakov,
2008b), where each NC is paraphrased by 25-30 an-
notators. For example, for chocolate bar, we find
the following list of verbs (the number of annotators
who proposed each verb is shown in parentheses):

be made of (16), contain (16), be made from
(10), be composed of (7), taste like (7), con-
sist of (5), be (3), have (2), melt into (2), be
manufactured from (2), be formed from (2),
smell of (2), be flavored with (1), sell (1), taste
of (1), be constituted by (1), incorporate (1),
serve (1), contain (1), store (1), be made with
(1), be solidified from (1), be created from (1),
be flavoured with (1), be comprised of (1).

Seed NCs: bronze statue, cable network, candy cigarette, chocolate bar, concrete desert, copper coin, daisy chain, glass eye,
immigrant minority, mountain range, paper money, plastic toy, sand dune, steel helmet, stone tool, student committee,
sugar cube, warrior castle, water drop, worker team
Seed patterns: be composed of, be comprised of, be inhabited by, be lived in by, be made from, be made of, be made up of,
be manufactured from, be printed on, consist of, contain, have, house, include, involve, look like, resemble, taste like

Table 1: Our seed examples: 20 noun compounds and 18 verb patterns.

As we can see, the most frequent patterns are of
highest quality, e.g., be made of (16), while the less
frequent ones can be wrong, e.g., serve (1). There-
fore, we filtered out all verbs that were proposed less
than five times with the 20 seed NCs. We further re-
moved the verb be, which is too general, thus ending
up with 18 seed patterns. Note that some patterns
can paraphrase multiple NCs: the total number of
seed NC-pattern pairs is 84.

The seed NCs and patterns are shown in Table 1.
While some patterns, e.g., taste like do not express
the target relation MAKE2, we kept them anyway
since they were proposed by several human anno-
tators and since they do express the fine-grained se-
mantics of some particular instances of that relation;
thus, we thought they might be useful, even for the
general relation. For example, taste like has been
proposed 8 times for candy cigarette, 7 times for
chocolate bar, and 2 times for sugar cube, and thus
it clearly correlates well with some seed examples,
even if it does not express MAKE2 in general.

6 Experiments and Evaluation

Using the NCs and patterns in Table 1 as initial
seeds, we ran our algorithm for three iterations of
loose bootstrapping and strict bootstrapping, and
for two iterations of NC-only strict bootstrapping.
We only performed up to three iterations because
of the huge number of noun compounds extracted
for NC-only strict bootstrapping (which we only ran
for two iterations) and because of the low number of
new NCs extracted by loose bootstrapping on itera-
tion 3. While we could have run strict bootstrapping
for more iterations, we opted for a comparable num-
ber of iterations for all three methods.

Examples of noun compounds that we have ex-
tracted are bronze bell (be made of, be made from)
and child team (be composed of, include). Exam-
ple patterns are be filled with (cotton bag, water cup)
and use (water sculpture, wood statue).

terns and NC-pattern pairs extracted and retained for each
of the three methods over all iterations.

Tables 2 and 3 show the overall results. As we
mentioned in section 4.2.3, at each iteration, we fil-
tered out all patterns that were extracted less than N
times or with less than M NCs. Note that we only
used the 10 most frequent NCs per pattern as NC
seeds for NC extraction in the next iteration of strict
bootstrapping and NC-only strict bootstrapping. Ta-
ble 3 shows the results for two value combinations
of (N ;M ): (5;50) and (10;20). Note also that if
some NC was extracted by several different patterns,
it was only counted once. Patterns are subject to
particular NCs, and thus we show (1) the number
of patterns extracted with all NCs, i.e., unique NC-
pattern pairs, (2) the accuracy of these pairs,4 and
(3) the number of unique patterns retained after fil-
tering, which will be used to extract new noun com-
pounds on the second step of the current iteration.

4One of the reviewers suggested that evaluating the accuracy
of NC-pattern pairs could potentially conceal some of the drift
of our algorithm. For example, while water cup / be filled with
is a correct NC-pattern pair, water cup is incorrect for MAKE2;
it is probably an instance of Levi’s FOR. Thus, the same boot-
strapping technique evaluated against a fixed set of semantic re-
lations (which is the more traditional approach) could arguably
show bootstrapping going “off the rails” more quickly than what
we observe here. However, our goal, as stated in Section 3, is to
find NC-specific paraphrases, and our evaluation methodology
is more adequate with respect to this goal.

Table 3: Evaluation results for up to three iterations. For NCs, we show the number of unique NCs extracted and
their accuracy in %. For patterns, we show the number of unique NC-pattern pairs extracted, their accuracy in %, and
the number of unique patterns retained and used to extract NCs on the second step of the current iteration. The first
column shows the pattern filtering thresholds used (see Section 4.2.3 for details).

The above accuracies were calculated based on
human judgments by an experienced, well-trained
annotator. We also hired a second annotator for a
small subset of the examples.

For NCs, the first annotator judged whether each
NC is an instance of MAKE2. All NCs were judged,
except for iteration 2 of NC-only strict bootstrap-
ping, where their number was prohibitively high and
only the most frequent noun compounds extracted
for each modifier and for each head were checked:
9,004 NCs for N=5 and 4,262 NCs for N=10.

For patterns, our first annotator judged the cor-
rectness of the unique NC-pattern pairs, i.e., whether
the NC is paraphrasable with the target pattern.
Given the large number of NC-pattern pairs, the an-
notator only judged patterns with their top 10 most
frequent NCs. For example, if there were 5 patterns
extracted, then the NC-pattern pairs to be judged
would be no more than 5 × 10 = 50.

Our second annotator judged 340 random exam-
ples: 100 NCs and 20 patterns with their top 10 NCs
for each iteration. The Cohen’s kappa (Cohen, 1960)
between the two annotators is .66 (85% initial agree-
ment), which corresponds to substantial agreement
(Landis and Koch, 1977).

7 Discussion

Tables 2 and 3 show that fixing one of the two nouns
in the pattern, as in strict bootstrapping and NC-only
strict bootstrapping, yields significantly higher ac-
curacy (χ2 test) for both NC and NC-pattern pair
extraction compared to loose bootstrapping.

The accuracy for NC-only strict bootstrapping is
a bit higher than for strict bootstrapping, but the ac-
tual differences are probably smaller since the eval-
uation of the former on iteration 2 was done for the
most frequent NCs, which are more accurate.

Note that the number of extracted NCs is much
higher with the strict methods because of the higher
number of possible instantiations of the generalized
query patterns. For NC-only strict bootstrapping,
the number of extracted NCs grows exponentially
since the number of patterns does not diminish as
in the other two methods. The number of extracted
patterns is similar for the different methods since we
select no more than 20 of them per iteration.

Overall, the accuracy for all methods decreases
from one iteration to the next since errors accumu-
late; still, the degradation is slow. Note also the ex-
ception of loose bootstrapping on iteration 3.

Comparing the results for N=5 and N=10, we
can see that, for all three methods, using the latter
yields a sizable drop in the number of extracted NCs
and NC-pattern pairs; it also tends to yield a slightly
improved accuracy. Note, however, the exception
of loose bootstrapping for the first two iterations,
where the less restrictive N=5 is more accurate.

As a comparison, we implemented the method
of Kim and Baldwin (2007), which generates new
semantically interpreted NCs by replacing either
the head or the modifier of a seed NC with suit-
able synonyms, hypernyms and sister words from
WordNet, followed by similarity filtering using
WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al., 2004).

The abbreviations Syn., Hyp., and Sis. indicate using syn-
onyms, hypernyms, and sister words, respectively.

The results for three bootstrapping iterations us-
ing the same list of 20 initial seed NCs as in our pre-
vious experiments, are shown in Table 4. We can see
that the overall accuracy of their method is slightly
better than ours. Note, however, that our method ac-
quired a much larger number of NCs, while allow-
ing more variety in the NC semantics. Moreover, for
each extracted noun compound, we also generated a
list of fine-grained paraphrasing verbs.

8 Error Analysis

Below we analyze the errors of our method.
Many problems were due to wrong POS assign-

ment. For example, on Step 2, because of the omis-
sion of that in “the statue has such high quality gold
(that) demand is ...”, demand was tagged as a noun
and thus extracted as an NC modifier instead of gold.
The problem also arose on Step 1, where we used
WordNet to check whether the NC candidates were
composed of two nouns. Since words like clear,
friendly, and single are listed in WordNet as nouns
(which is possible in some contexts), we extracted
wrong NCs such as clear cube, friendly team, and
single chain. There were similar issues with verb-
particle constructions since some particles can be
used as nouns as well, e.g., give back, break down.

Some errors were due to semantic transparency
issues, where the syntactic and the semantic head of
a target NP were mismatched (Fillmore et al., 2002;
Fontenelle, 1999). For example, from the sentence
“This wine is made from a range of white grapes.”,
we would extract range rather than grapes as the po-
tential modifier of wine.

In some cases, the NC-pattern pair was correct,
but the NC did not express the target relation, e.g.,
while contain is a good paraphrase for toy box, the
noun compound itself is not an instance of MAKE2.

There were also cases where the pair of extracted
nouns did not make a good NC, e.g., worker work or
year toy. Note that this is despite our checking that
the candidate NC occurred at least 100 times in the
Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus (see Section 4.1.3).
We hypothesized that such bad NCs would tend to
have a low collocation strength. We tested this hy-
pothesis using the Dice coefficient, calculated using
the Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus. Figure 2 shows a
plot of the NC accuracy vs. collocation strength for
strict bootstrapping with N=5, M=50 for all three
iterations (the results for the other experiments show
a similar trend). We can see that the accuracy im-
proves slightly as the collocation strength increases:
compare the left and the right ends of the graph (the
results are mixed in the middle though).

9 Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a framework for building a very
large dataset of noun compounds expressing a given
target abstract semantic relation. For each extracted
noun compound, we generated a corresponding fine-
grained semantic interpretation: a frequency distri-
bution over suitable paraphrasing verbs.

In future work, we plan to apply our frame-
work to the remaining relations in the inventory of
Levi (1978), and to release the resulting dataset to
the research community. We believe that having a
large-scale dataset of noun compounds interpreted
with both fine- and coarse-grained semantic rela-
tions would be an important contribution to the de-
bate about which representation is preferable for dif-
ferent tasks. It should also help the overall advance-
ment of the field of noun compound interpretation.
