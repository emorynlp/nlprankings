Abstract

Among the application domains of information extraction, the biomedical domain is one of the
most important ones. This is due to the large amount of biomedical text sources including the vast
scientific literature and collections of patient reports written in natural language. These sources
contain a wealth of crucial knowledge that needs to be mined. Typical mining tasks regard entity
recognition, entity-relation extraction, and event and event participant recognition. Recently we
witness an interest in the recognition of spatial relationships between entities and of temporal
relationships between events. One of the most important problems in information extraction
regards dealing with a limited amount of examples that are manually annotated by experts and
that can be used for training the extraction models.

In this talk we discuss how we can leverage knowledge contained in unlabelled texts and onto-
logical knowledge about known relationships between the output labels used for the extractions.
The former aspect especially focuses on how to automatically create novel training examples
from the unlabelled data, the latter on how to integrate the relationships in models for structured
machine learning during training and testing of the extraction models in the most efficient way.
We show promising results and point to directions of future research.
