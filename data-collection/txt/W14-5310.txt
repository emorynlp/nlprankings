Abstract

Swiss German is a dialect continuum whose dialects are very different from Standard German,
the official language of the German part of Switzerland. However, dealing with Swiss German in
natural language processing, usually the detour through Standard German is taken. As writing in
Swiss German has become more and more popular in recent years, we would like to provide data
to serve as a stepping stone to automatically process the dialects. We compiled NOAH’s Corpus
of Swiss German Dialects consisting of various text genres, manually annotated with Part-of-
Speech tags. Furthermore, we applied this corpus as training set to a statistical Part-of-Speech
tagger and achieved an accuracy of 90.62%.

1 Introduction

Swiss German is not an official language of Switzerland, rather it includes dialects of Standard German,
which is one of the four official languages. However, it is different from Standard German in terms of
phonetics, lexicon, morphology and syntax. Swiss German is not dividable into a few dialects, in fact it is
a dialect continuum with a huge variety. Swiss German is not only a spoken dialect but increasingly used
in written form, especially in less formal text types. Often, Swiss German speakers write text messages,
emails and blogs in Swiss German. However, in recent years it has become more and more popular and
authors are publishing in their own dialect. Nonetheless, there is neither a writing standard nor an official
orthography, which increases the variations dramatically due to the fact that people write as they please
with their own style.

So far, there are almost no natural language processing (NLP) tools for Swiss German (Scherrer and
Owen, 2010). Considering the fact that the major part of communication between Swiss people of the
German part is in dialect, we would like to start building NLP tools for Swiss German dialects.

Furthermore, it is an attempt to deal with dialect varieties directly instead of taking the detour through
the standard of a language. Speakers of various dialects increasingly communicate through social media
in their own varieties. These interactions are relatively easily accessible and could be used as a source
of data. However, there is a lack of natural language processing tools for dialects, which need to be
developed first in order to process these data automatically.

We start with training a model for a Swiss German Part-of-Speech tagger, which is one of the first steps
dealing with the automatic processing of natural language. Based on a part-of-speech tagged corpus, fur-
ther processes like semantical analysis, syntactical parsing or even applications like machine translation
can be conducted.

In order to train a PoS tagger we need a corpus annotated with parts-of-speech. As such data does not
exist yet, we compiled NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects containing Swiss German texts of dif-
ferent genres, and annotated it manually. This is an iterative process alternating between running/training
a PoS tagger and manually annotating/correcting the output. The corpus we present in this paper consists
of 73,616 manually annotated tokens covering many dialect variations of the German-speaking part of
Switzerland.

In the next section, we will mention some related work before we will have a closer look at the Swiss
German dialects and its differences to Standard German in section 3. In section 4 we introduce our
corpus including the adapted tagset before we present the application of our corpus to the Part-of-Speech
tagging task in section 5.

2 Related Work

Most natural language processing applications focus on standardised, written language varieties, but
from a methodological as well as a practical point of view, it is interesting to develop NLP methods for
variational linguistics. Even though there are no other resources of this size and no studies on PoS tagging
for written Swiss German, there have been a few approaches which share some common aspects with our
work. While there are some corpora of spoken texts, such as the Archimob project (Dejung et al., 1999)
which comprises transcribed interviews, it is difficult to find resources to build a written Swiss German
corpus. One of the rare written resources is the sms4science project (Dürscheid and Stark, 2011), a
collection of text messages in all official languages of Switzerland as well as Swiss German dialects.

Concerning Part-of-Speech tagging for non-standard dialects, there are some approaches addressing
linguistic varieties in historical texts, Hinrichs and Zastrow (2012) and Rayson et al. (2007) for German
and English respectively. Furthermore, Diab (2009), Habash and Rambow (2009) and Duh and Kirchhoff
(2005) worked on PoS tagging for Arabic dialects. The latter developed a minimally supervised PoS
tagger for an Egyptian Arabic dialect, which does not have a standard orthography either, without using
any dialect-specific tools.

As far as Swiss German NLP goes, there are approaches to dialect identification (Scherrer and Owen,
2010), dialect machine translation (Scherrer, 2012) and morphology generation (Scherrer, 2013).

3 Swiss German

Swiss German belongs to the Alemannic group of dialects, a branch of the Germanic language family.
This group can be split into three linguistic divisions; Low, High and Highest Alemannic, each of which
contains a few regions of Switzerland. There is no strict border between the Swiss German dialects and
the other Alemannic dialects, rather it is referred to as a dialect continuum. Unlike the continuum among
Swiss German dialects, there is a strict separation between Swiss German and Standard German. When
it comes to the dialects of Swiss German, one can find the concept of diglossia. Diglossia is defined
as a situation in which two languages (or two varieties of the same language) are used under different
conditions within a language community. In the case of the German language, Standard German is used
in Switzerland nearly exclusively in written context while Swiss German is in daily use, mostly in spoken
form but also in informal written contexts (Siebenhaar and Wyler, 1997). However, this distinction is
becoming more and more blurred. Schools are one of a few environments where Standard German
is expected to be used in spoken language. Unlike the situation in other languages, it is standard in
Switzerland to use dialect even in formal situations. In Swiss media, both TV and radio, Swiss German
is well represented and commonly used.

With the introduction of emails, text messages, blogs and chats, Swiss German is taking over more
and more space in written contexts. Nowadays, especially for the younger generations, it is completely
normal to write in Swiss German. However, it is not limited to the private communication. In fact, it
is even becoming a cult status to write and publish in Swiss German. Many authors, among them for
example Lenz (2013), Schobinger (2014) and Kaiser (2012) write books in their dialect, and newspaper
agencies publish newspapers in Swiss German, e.g. Blick am Abend (Ringier AG, 2013, 2014). Even the
Swiss company Swatch has published their annual report 2012 in addition to Standard German, French
and English also Swiss German (The Swatch Group AG, 2012). This hype does not seem to cease, in
the contrary. Speaking a certain dialect is part of the identification. Swiss are proud of their dialect,
which makes it possible to identify their home region if they move to another canton. Despite the big
differences, speakers of various dialects usually understand each other, except a few German varieties of
the canton Valais which others usually have troubles understanding (Keller, 1961).

3.1 Differences to Standard German

Swiss German differs from Standard German in many aspects such as phonetics, lexicon, morphology
and syntax. One of the most significant differences is the vocabulary, which even introduces a new word
class not in use in Standard German (see section 4.2). In Swiss German, the Standard German words
are sometimes used in a different manner. For instance, in some cases the genus may change: the word
Radio (radio) as a masculine word (in Swiss German) instead of neutral (in Standard German). However,
there are not merely differences between Swiss and Standard German, but also between the different
dialectal regions. Scherrer (2011) differs between variations which apply for the whole Swiss German
speaking area and differences which appear only in certain dialects and not outside of Allemanic dialects.
The differences between the dialects are partly due to the influence from other languages. For instance
dialects closer to the French speaking part of Switzerland use different grammatical constructions than
Eastern Swiss dialects. In this section we describe some examples of disparities between the Swiss
German dialects and Standard German.

In Swiss German there is no preterite tense (“Präteritum”) and the pluperfect (“Plusquamperfekt”)
is used extremely rarely. Both of them are expressed using the present perfect (“Perfekt”) or rather a
duplication of it (for an example see table 1). Another difference exists with regards to verb tenses
and the use of the auxiliary verbs sein (to be) and haben (to have). For instance, if you are cold, in
Switzerland you would say Ich ha chalt., where ha is the first person singular of “to have”. However, to
express yourself in this situation in Standard German, the auxilary verb “to be” is used: Mir ist kalt.

Furthermore, there is more freedom in the order of words of a sentence, especially concerning verbs
(for an example see table 1) as well as more possibilities to correctly arrange phrases. The overt specifi-
cation of the subject is another difference. In Swiss German the subject can be dropped in many cases,
the information about the person is then usually given in the conjugation of the verb. In the question
Chunnsch au? (Swiss German) vs. Kommst du auch? (Standard German) (Are you coming too?), the
subject du is not explicitly expressed in the Swiss German version but only in the second person singular
conjugation of the verb.

Regarding nouns, the four cases of Standard German (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) are
not all in use in the dialects (Siebenhaar and Voegeli, 1997). Swiss German speakers generally neither
speak nor write in the genitive case, apart from a few exceptions e.g. in the dialect of the canton Valais.
The genitive is replaced by a possessive dative or a phrase using prepositions. This means, in order to
express the German phrase die Ohren des Hasen (the bunny’s ears), either the possessive dative am Haas
sini Ohrä or a preposition d Ohrä vom Haas (where vom is a fusion of an preposition von and an article
dem) is used. Moreover, nominative and accusative forms only differ in personal pronouns, whereas the
dative case, if used, is marked with its own determiner and endings for adjectives and nouns.

There are many phenomena, which are treated differently not only in regards to Standard German
but also in different dialects. First of all, the lexicon varies a lot. The variations do not only include
different pronunciation but also completely different words. For instance in some regions of Switzerland,
the Standard German word Butter (butter) is used (even though with a masculine article instead of the
feminine one, which is correct in Standard German). In other regions, however, different words such as
Anke are used instead. Another variation concerns the order of verbs if there is more than one of them in
a sentence. It is often inverted compared to Standard German, but this varies according to the dialect. To
express a final clause with um . . . zu (in order to) for instance, people in eastern Switzerland would use
the concatenation zum. Closer to the French speaking part though, the construction für . . . z is commonly
used, which marks the similarity to the French pour . . . .

The following sentences in table 1 contain examples of both kinds of differences. On the one hand,
there are the Standard German preterite forms liess and hatte, which are expressed in the perfect tense
across dialects: hat . . . (gehen) lassen and hat gehabt. On the other hand, the order of the verbs in the
perfect construction (het gha vs. gha hät) as well as the final clause with um . . . zu differs from dialect to
dialect.

Considering the way people write in Swiss German reveals another characteristic. The aforementioned
lack of a spelling standard causes variations not only between different authors but also within texts of

the same author. As people write how they speak, they are not consistent and may spell the same word
differently in the same sentence. They are also free to merge any words, which is quite common. Joining
words into compounds is not an unseen phenomena in Standard German either. However, a compound
is a word consisting of more than one stem, which can act as one word with one corresponding part-of-
speech (usually the one of the last part), e.g. Skilift (ski lift). In Swiss German, the process of merging
words rather resembles the phenomena of clitics, i.e. phonologically bound to another word (Loos et al.,
2004). For example gömmer is Swiss German for gehen wir (we go). Gömmer can not be split into
verb and pronoun, as the separate occurrences would be gönd (first person plural of to go) and mir (we).
Thus, such merged words are grammatically different words which, however, are phonologically bound
and can not stand alone. One phonological word (realised as one alphabetic string limited by white
spaces) can even contain the subject, an object and the finite verb of the sentence (see section 4.2 for an
example). This means it can not be assigned to one part-of-speech. In section 4.2 we present how we
deal with them in the part-of-speech tagging task.

To strengthen our argumentation for the necessity of a Swiss German PoS tagger we compare our
results of the training with our corpus with the performance of a Standard German tagger. We run the
German model of the most common tagger for Standard German, the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), on our
Swiss German test set. The tagger reaches an accuracy of 50.8%, which is significantly lower than the
result after the training with our corpus.

As we have shown in this section, the dialects of Swiss German differ in many aspects from Standard
German. It is not only a different pronounciation or spelling with some variations in the vocabulary.
It also involves syntactic differences and constructions which are ungrammatical when transferred to
German. Therefore we argue against a normalisation of Swiss German as a mapping to Standard German,
a frequently proposed approach dealing with varieties.

4 Corpus Creation

We compiled a Swiss German dialect corpus in order to provide resources to work with Swiss German.
Furthermore, we applied the corpus to the basic natural language processing task of Part-of-Speech
tagging as a first application. Therefore, we specified a tagset for Swiss German and annotated the
corpus according to this tagset.

4.1 NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects
We present NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects, a unique resource for Swiss German. We com-
piled a Swiss German corpus containing manually annotated part-of-speech tags of 73,616 tokens. As
the first annotated resource for written texts in Swiss German dialects, the goal is to cover various text
genres as well as different dialects from all regions of Switzerland. NOAH’s Corpus is freely available
for research.1

In NOAH’s Corpus, we include articles from the Alemannic Wikipedia (Wikipedia, The Free Encyclo-
pedia, 2011) in five major dialects (Aarau, Basel, Bern, Zurich and the Eastern part of Switzerland) and a
Swiss German special edition of the newspaper “Blick am Abend” (Ringier AG, 2013), which was pub-
lished in 2013. In addition, we added sections of the Swiss German dialect version of the official annual
report of the Swatch company from 2012 (The Swatch Group AG, 2012). Furthermore, we incorporated
extracts of novels from the Swiss author Viktor Schobinger (Viktor Schobinger, 2013) which are written
exclusively in the Zurich dialect. Finally, we also included three blogs from BlogSpot in various dialects
as a web resource. The detailed token quantities for each text source are shown in table 2.

Table 2: Corpus composition

Manning (2011) suggests that the largest opportunities for improvement in part-of-speech tagging lies
in improving the tagset and the accuracy of annotation, even though a perfect annotation of words into
discrete lexical categories is not possible because some words do not fall clearly into one category. Thus,
since the consistency of annotations in natural language corpora is of great importance for PoS tagging
performance, we put great emphasis on the manual annotations. After the annotation of the corpus by
native speakers, various consistency checks were conducted. For instance, we checked words with low
probabilities in the tagging model and we also conducted random checks for cases of difficult tags.

4.2 Tagset

As the basic tagset we use the Stuttgart-Tübingen-TagSet (STTS), which is the standard for German
(Schiller et al., 1999). Because of the differences between German and the Swiss German dialects we
additionally introduced the tag PTKINF as well as the adding of a “+”-sign to any PoS tag.

The newly introduced tag PTKINF represents an infinitive particle suggested by Glaser (2003). It
is a commonly used and therefore widely analysed phenomenon for Swiss German dialects with no
corresponding word or construction in German. In Swiss German people say Ich go go poschte. (I’m
going shopping.). The second go corresponds to the finite verb gehen (to go) in the according Standard
German sentence Ich gehe einkaufen. The first go, however, does not exist in the Standard German
version. This particle is probably originally derived from gehen. However, as a particle it exceeds the
use in gehen (Glaser, 2003). This infinitive particle go (derived from gehen; to go) also comes in other
forms like for instance cho (derived from kommen; to come) and afa (probably derived from anfangen;
to begin). In our corpus we found 37 occurrences of this tag.

Furthermore, we introduce special tags for merged words. Since Swiss German does not have official
spelling rules, words can be freely joined. Splitting these words in a pre-processing step would be one
approach to deal with them. However, it is not always clear where to split them and would result in
strange words as the words phonologically assimilate when merged with others (see section 3.1). Also
Manning (2011) suggests that splitting tags seems to be largely a waste of time for the goal of improving
PoS tagging numbers.

Instead of splitting, we identify these merged words by using the corresponding STTS-tag for the first
part and add a plus sign to show that a given word consists of more than one simple word. There are
sequences of words that are commonly joined, but also less common combinations can appear as it de-
pends on the preferences of the writer. A commonly joined sequence is, for instance, VAFIN+PPER,
a personal pronoun attached to a finite auxiliary verb, e.g. hets for German hat es (there is). An ex-
ample for a less commonly joined sequence would be a concatenation of three different parts of speech
VVFIN+PIS+PPER such as bruchtmese for the German words braucht man sie (one uses/needs it). Fig-
ure 3 shows some more examples of the most frequent combinations (e.g. a verb, a conjunction or a
particle followed by a pronoun). We found 1008 occurrences of merged words, which represent 1.37%
of all tokens in the corpus.

The STTS-tagset already contains one tag that is a combination of two, namely the APPRART, con-
sisting of a preposition APPR and an article ART. This is used for words like beim, which is composed of
bei and dem. However, these are “normal” Standard German prepositions. This is not the case with the
word combinations in Swiss German writing habits, where any words of completely different parts-of-
speech can be merged together. Using the approach of simply joining the corresponding part-of-speech
tags of the words like the APPRART-case, we would end up with an infinite tagset. Thus, the approach

VMFIN+ chame kann man can one

Table 3: PoS tags for compound words

of adding a plus sign allows us to have a clearly defined tagset. Another advantage is that it is possible
to identify all the concatenated words easily, looking for PoS tags with a “+”-sign attached. Once the list
of all occurrences is given, the corresponding tags can still be modified according to one’s requirements
for further processing in a text or corpus. Moreover, there is not a huge loss of information due to the
omitted part-of-speech information for the other word part(s). For many combinations it is very clear
which part of speech follows. Coming across a PTKZU+ for example, the only possibility for the second
part is a verb in the infinitive, a fact that can be inferred from the grammar.

5 Evaluation of PoS Tagging

In order to achieve the best results we trained different statistical, open source PoS taggers: TreeTagger
(Schmid, 1995), hunpos tagger (Halácsy et al., 2007), RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008), Wapiti CRF
Tagger (Lavergne et al., 2010), TnT (Trigrams’n’Tags) tagger (Brants, 2000) and BTagger (Gesmundo
and Samardz̆ić, 2012). The BTagger and the TnT tagger reach the best results for our corpus, therefore
we did a more detailed evaluation of the tagging results based on these two taggers.

5.1 Results

We evaluated the performance of the BTagger and the TnT tagger over our corpus with 10-fold cross
validation. The folds we created are non-stratified, i.e. not contiguous sentences. This is because our
corpus consists of diverse kinds of text. If we train the tagger on the whole corpus with diverse kinds
of text and then evaluate only on blogs for instance, we will not get a fair result. Thus, in order to get
balanced test sets, we chose the sentence for the 10 folds randomly. With the whole corpus as training
set, we reach an accuracy of 90.62% with the BTagger and 90.14% with the TnT tagger (see table 4).
Considering the 26.36% unknown tokens in average over all test sets, the accuracy for the unknown
tokens is surprisingly high.

Accuracy BTagger TnT tagger
Unknown tokens 77.99% 72.39%
Known tokens 93.34% 93.26%
Overall 90.62% 90.14%

Table 4: Accuracy of taggers over the whole corpus

As stated in section 4.1, our corpus contains texts from different genres. Therefore we additionally
evaluated the different text genres individually. The results are shown in table 5. The Wikipedia articles
score best with 90.92% accuracy. This is due to the fact that it is the biggest part of the corpus with
20,135 tokens (one third). In addition, the amount of unknown words is not as high as in other texts
because the variety of different words is limited to one topic per article. The literary texts are on the
second place. This corpus part is only half of the size of the Wikipedia articles. However, the texts are all
extracted from the criminal novels of Viktor Schobinger. This means, they are written in one dialect by
one person, which reduces the number of orthographic varieties and thus the number of unknown tokens.
As table 5 shows, the novels have only 16% of unknown tokens, less than all the other parts.

Furthermore, we analysed the relation between the size of the corpus and the accuracy we achieved
(see figure 1). In the case of Swiss German we found that the accuracy increases significantly until
approximately 40,000 tokens. Increasing the size of the corpus beyond this amount of tokens is helpful

90



Accuracy Accuracy Accuracy Number of
Text type overall unknown tokens known tokens unknown tokens
Wikipedia articles 90.92% 75.64% 94.60% 22.7%
Literary texts (novels) 89.37% 70.41% 92.89% 16.0%
Annual report 88.82% 76.95% 92.72% 24.7%
Blogs 88.10% 71.69% 91.73% 18.2%
Newspaper articles 87.17% 71.19% 93.15% 27.4%

Table 5: Results for the different text genres with the BTagger

to cover a larger amount of orthographic varieties and reducing the number of unknown words, but does
not considerably improve the accuracy of known tokens.

Another fact that stands out in figure 1 is the difference of the tagger performances for a training set
of 10,000 tokens. This is due to the fact that that the BTagger makes use of context information and
thus emphasises the transition probability by learning sequences of tags. Therefore, not a huge amount
of data is needed to get a comparably good performance (Gesmundo and Samardz̆ić, 2012). The TnT
tagger, on the other hand, emphasises the emission probability and does not generalise as well.

Figure 1: Relation between PoS tagging accuracy and corpus size for the TnT tagger (grey line) and the
slightly better results from the BTagger (black line).

In section 3.1, discussing the differences between Standard German and Swiss German, we argue
that Standard German tools are not capable of dealing with Swiss German dialects. As an additional
experiment we extend our Swiss German corpus with a Standard German corpus to see if the addition of
information of Standard German data improves the result. We combined our Swiss German corpus with
the TüBa-D/Z German Treebank (Telljohann et al., 2006), which contains more than 1,300,000 tokens.
The results on a 10-fold cross validation reached an accuracy of 87.6% which is lower than the results
for the Swiss German corpus by itself. This implies that the addition of Standard German training data
to our Swiss German corpus is not helpful for the training of a Swiss German PoS tagger.

91



5.2 Error Analysis

The most frequent errors were the confusion of nouns (NN) and proper names (NE), which represent
ca. 15% of all errors. This is also a common problem for Standard German due to the capitalisation of
nouns. The different kinds of adjectives and the adverbs as well as various types of verbs are also often
mistaken, but these are confusions inside one part-of-speech category. Furthermore, there are many
mistakes between articles and some types of pronouns, especially personal and demonstrative. However,
this is not surprising as they often have the same form. For example the German indefinite article ein is
often realised as es in Swiss German, the definite article das as s. The Swiss German es also stands for
the German neutral personal pronoun es if it is not abbreviated to s. This issue is exemplified in table 6.

PoS tag Swiss German example Standard German English
ART (definite) es Buech ein Buch a book
ART (indefinite) s Buech das Buch the book
PPER Es isch rot. Es ist rot. It is red.
PPER S rägnet. Es regnet. It is raining.

Table 6: Example of the same types with different PoS tags and meanings

5.3 Discussion & Future Work

We achieved reasonable PoS tagging results for the Swiss German dialects considering the low amount
of available resources. As stated in section 3, we are dealing with a dialect continuum missing an orthog-
raphy standard. We neither select one specific dialect (or region) of Switzerland nor do we normalise the
data in any way. Thus, our data contains a high amount of hapax legomena, i.e. words which only appear
once. This fact explains the considerably lower accuracy for unknown tokens compared to taggers for
standardised languages. Furthermore, we include different sources and different text genres in one cor-
pus, which does not simplify the work for a statistical PoS tagger. Thus, it is conceivable that accuracy
improvements may be achieved by concentrating on one particular dialect.

In future work we will enlarge NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects by including more texts
per dialect in order to reduce the number of unknown tokens. Another approach we are pursuing is
to develop a procedure based on lexical distance measures and syntactical patterns in order to map the
different orthographic version of a token, so that the tagger can benefit from these mappings. This
procedure may also serve as a starting point towards the lemmatisation of Swiss German texts.

The goal of improving Part-of-Speech tagging for Swiss German as well as extending the corpus is to
enable and facilitate the development of further NLP tasks, such as dependency parsing, opinion mining
or deeper dialectology studies.

6 Conclusion

We have presented our work on compiling a corpus of Swiss German dialects and its application to the
training of a Part-of-Speech tagger. As a first resource, our corpus is a stepping stone for natural language
processing for the Swiss German dialect area. Training the BTagger on our corpus results in an accuracy
of 90.62%. With little post processing effort on the tagger output, a PoS-annotated corpus for Swiss
German can be obtained and thus resources extended.

NOAH’s Corpus of Swiss German Dialects contains 73,616 tokens from texts of different genres in
different dialects, manually annotated with PoS tags. We are happy to share it with interested parties.
The corpus including the PoS tags can be downloaded in XML format.
