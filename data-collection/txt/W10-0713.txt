Abstract

We describe our experience using both Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and Crowd-
Flower to collect simple named entity anno-
tations for Twitter status updates. Unlike most
genres that have traditionally been the focus of
named entity experiments, Twitter is far more
informal and abbreviated. The collected anno-
tations and annotation techniques will provide
a first step towards the full study of named en-
tity recognition in domains like Facebook and
Twitter. We also briefly describe how to use
MTurk to collect judgements on the quality of
“word clouds.”

1 Introduction and Dataset Description

Information extraction researchers commonly work
on popular formal domains, such as news arti-
cles. More diverse studies have included broadcast
news transcripts, blogs and emails (Strassel et al.,
2008). However, extremely informal domains, such
as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Flickr are start-
ing to receive more attention. Any effort aimed at
studying these informal genres will require at least a
minimal amount of labeled data for evaluation pur-
poses.

This work details how to efficiently annotate large
volumes of data, for information extraction tasks, at
low cost using MTurk (Snow et al., 2008; Callison-
Burch, 2009). This paper describes a case study for
information extraction tasks involving short, infor-
mal messages from Twitter. Twitter is a large multi-
user site for broadcasting short informal messages.
Twitter is an extreme example of an informal genre

(Java et al., 2007) as users frequently abbreviate
their posts to fit within the specified limit. Twitter
is a good choice because it is very popular: Twitter
users generate a tremendous number of status up-
dates (tweets) every day1. This is a good genre to
work on named entity extraction since many tweets
refer to and contain updates about named entities.

Our Twitter data set has over 150 million tweets
from 1.5 million users collected over a period of
three years. Tweets are unlike formal text. They are
limited to a maximum of 140 characters, a limit orig-
inally set to allow them to fit into an SMS message.
Consequently, the use of acronyms and both stan-
dard and non-standard abbreviations (e.g., b4 for be-
fore and ur for your) are very common. Tweets tend
to be telegraphic and often consist of sentence frag-
ments or other ungrammatical sequences. Normal
capitalization rules (e.g., for proper names, book ti-
tles, etc.) are commonly ignored.

Furthermore, users have adopted numerous con-
ventions including hashtags, user mentions, and
retweet markers. A hashtag (e.g., #earthquake) is
a token beginning with a ’#’ character that denotes
one of the topic of a status. Hashtags can be used as
pure metadata or serve both as a word and as meta-
data, as the following two examples show.

• EvanEcullen: #chile #earthquake #tsunami They
heard nothing of a tsunami until it slammed into
their house with an unearthly http://tl.gd/d798d

• LarsVonD: Know how to help #Chile after the
#Earthquake

1Pingdom estimated that there were nearly 40 million tweets
a day in January 2010 (pingdom.com, 2010).

of a devastating earthquake and makes plans for re-
covery. http://bit.ly/dwoQMD
Note: “the economist” was not recognized as an
ORG.
(2) how come when george bush wanted to take out
millions for the war congress had no problem...but
whe obama wants money for healthcare the ...
Note: Both “george bush” and “obama” were missed
as PERs.
(3) RT @woodmuffin: jay leno interviewing sarah
palin: the seventh seal starts to show a few cracks
Note: RT (code for a re-tweet) was mistaken as a po-
sition and sarah palin missed as a person.

Table 1: Standard named entity systems trained on text from
newswire articles and other well formed documents lose accu-
racy when applied to short status updates.

The Twitter community also has a convention where
user names preceded by an @ character (known as
“mentions”) at the beginning of a status indicate that
it is a message directed at that user. A user mention
in the middle of a message is interpreted as a general
reference to that user. Both uses are shown in this
status:

• paulasword: @obama quit calling @johnboener a
liar, you liar

The token RT is used as a marker that a person is for-
warding a tweet originally sent by another user. Nor-
mally the re-tweet symbol begins the message and
is immediately followed by the user mention of the
original author or sometimes a chain of re-tweeters
ending with the original author, as in

• politicsiswar: RT @KatyinIndy @SamiShamieh:
Ghost towns on rise under Obama
http://j.mp/cwJSUg #tcot #gop (Deindustrial-
ization of U.S.- Generation Zero)

Finally, “smileys” are common in Twitter statuses to
signal the users’ sentiment, as in the following.

• sallytherose: Just wrote a 4-page paper in an hour
and a half. BOiiiiii I’m getting good at this. :) Left-
over Noodles for dinner as a reward. :D

The Twitter search service also uses these to retrieve
tweets matching a query with positive or negative
sentiment.

Typical named entity recognition systems have
been trained on formal documents, such as news

Figure 1: Our Twitter collection is stored in a relational
database and also in the Lucene information retrieval system.

wire articles. Their performance on text from very
different sources, especially informal genres such as
Twitter tweets or Facebook status updates, is poor.
In fact, “Systems analyzing correctly about 90% of
the sequences from a journalistic corpus can have a
decrease of performance of up to 50% on more in-
formal texts.” (Poibeau and Kosseim, 2001) How-
ever, many large scale information extraction sys-
tems require extracting and integrating useful in-
formation from online social networking sources
that are informal such as Twitter, Facebook, Blogs,
YouTube and Flickr.

To illustrate the problem we applied both the
NLTK (Bird et al., 2009) and the Stanford named
entity recognizers (Finkel et al., 2005) without re-
training to a sample Twitter dataset with mixed re-
sults. We have observed many failures, both false
positives and false negatives. Table 1 shows some
examples of these.

2 Task design

We developed separate tasks on CrowdFlower and
MTurk using a common collection of Twitter sta-
tuses and asked workers to perform the same anno-
tation task in order to fully understand the features
that each provides, and to determine the total amount
of work necessary to produce a result on each ser-
vice. MTurk has the advantage of using standard
HTML and Javascript instead of CrowdFlower’s
CML. However MTurk has inferior data verifica-
tion, in that the service only provides a threshold
on worker agreement as a form of quality control.

81



This is quite poor when tasks are more complicated
than a single boolean judgment, as with the case at
hand. CrowdFlower works across multiple services
and does verification against gold standard data, and
can get more judgements to improve quality in cases
where it’s necessary.

3 Annotation guidelines

The task asked workers to look at Twitter individ-
ual status messages (tweets) and use a toggle but-
ton to tag each word with person (PER), organiza-
tion (ORG), location (LOC), or “none of the above”
(NONE). Each word also had a check box (labeled
???) to indicate that uncertainty. We provided the
workers with annotation guidelines adapted from the
those developed by the Linguistic Data Consortium
(Linguistic Data Consortium – LCTL Team, 2006)
which were in turn based on guidelines used for
MUC-7 (Chinchor and Robinson, 1997).

We deliberately kept our annotation goals simple:
We only asked workers to identify three basic types
of named entities.

Our guidelines read:

An entity is a object in the world like a place
or person and a named entity is a phrase that
uniquely refers to an object by its proper name
(Hillary Clinton), acronym (IBM), nickname
(Opra) or abbreviation (Minn.).

Person (PER) entities are limited to humans
(living, deceased, fictional, deities, ...) iden-
tified by name, nickname or alias. Don’t in-
clude titles or roles (Ms., President, coach).
Include suffix that are part of a name (e.g., Jr.,
Sr. or III).

Organization (ORG) entities are limited to
corporations, institutions, government agen-
cies and other groups of people defined by
an established organizational structure. Some
examples are businesses (Bridgestone Sports
Co.), stock ticker symbols (NASDAQ), multi-
national organizations (European Union), po-
litical parties (GOP) non-generic government
entities (the State Department), sports teams
(the Yankees), and military groups (the Tamil
Tigers). Do not tag ‘generic’ entities like “the
government” since these are not unique proper
names referring to a specific ORG.

Location (LOC) entities include names of
politically or geographically defined places

(cities, provinces, countries, international re-
gions, bodies of water, mountains, etc.). Lo-
cations also include man-made structures like
airports, highways, streets, factories and mon-
uments.

We instructed annotators to ignore other types of
named entities, e.g., events (World War II), products
(iPhone), animals (Cheetah), inanimate objects and
monetary units (the Euro) and gave them four prin-
ciples to follow when tagging:

• Tag words according to their meaning in the
context of the tweet.

• Only tag names, i.e., words that directly and
uniquely refer to entities.

• Only tag names of the types PER,ORG, and
LOC.

• Use the ??? checkbox to indicate uncertainty
in your tag.

3.1 Data selection

We created a “gold standard” data set of about 400
tweets to train and screen workers on MTurk, to salt
the MTurk data with worker evaluation data, for use
on CrowdFlower, and to evaluate the performance
of the final NER system after training on the crowd-
sourced annotations. We preselected tweets to an-
notate using the NLTK named entity recognizer to
select statuses that were thought to contain named
entities of the desired types (PER, ORG, LOC).

Initial experiments suggested that a worker can
annotate about 400 tweets an hour. Based on this, we
loaded each MTurk Human Intelligence Tasks (HIT)
with five tweets, and paid workers five cents per HIT.
Thus, if we require that each tweet be annotated by
two workers, we would be able to produce about
4,400 raw annotated tweets with the $100 grant from
Amazon, accounting for their 10% overhead price.

3.2 CrowdFlower

We also experimented with CrowdFlower, a crowd-
sourcing service that uses various worker channels
like MTurk and SamaSource2 and provides an en-
hanced set of management and analytic tools. We
were interested in understanding the advantages and
disadvantages compared to using MTurk directly.

2http://www.samasource.org/

82



Figure 2: CrowdFlower is an enhanced service that feeds into
MTurk and other crowdsourcing systems. It provides conve-
nient management tools that show the performance of workers
for a task.

We prepared a basic front-end for our job using the
CrowdFlower Markup Language (CML) and custom
JavaScript. We used the CrowdFlower interface to
calibrate our job and to decide the pay rate. It con-
siders various parameters like amount of time re-
quired to complete a sample task and the desired ac-
curacy level to come up with a pay rate.

One attractive feature lets one provide a set of
“gold standard” tasks that pair data items with cor-
rect responses. These are automatically mixed into
the stream of regular tasks that workers process. If
a worker makes errors in one of these gold stan-
dard tasks, she gets immediate feedback about her
error and the correct answer is shown. CrowdFlower
claims that error rates are reduced by a factor of
two when gold standards are used(crowdflower.com,
2010). The interface shown in Figure 2 shows the
number of gold tasks the user has seen, and how
many they have gotten correct.

CrowdFlower’s management tools provides a de-
tailed analysis of the workers for a job, including
the trust level, accuracy and past accuracy history
associated with each worker. In addition, the output
records include the geographical region associated
with each worker, information that may be useful
for some tasks.

3.3 MTurk

The current iteration of our MTurk interface is
shown in Figure 3. Each tweet is shown at the top
of the HIT interface so that it can easily be read for
context. Then a table is displayed with each word
of the tweet down the side, and radio buttons to pick

Figure 3: In the MTurk interface a tweet is shown in its entirety
at the top, then a set of radio buttons and a checkbox is shown
for each word of the tweet. These allow the user to pick the
annotation for each word, and indicate uncertainty in labeling.

what kind of entity each word is. Every ten rows,
the header is repeated, to allow the worker to scroll
down the page and still see the column labels. The
interface also provides a checkbox allows the worker
to indicate uncertainty in labeling a word.

We expect that our data will include some tricky
cases where an annotator, even an experienced one,
may be unsure whether a word is part of a named
entity and/or what type it is. For example, is ’Bal-
timore Visionary Art Museum’ a LOC followed by
a three word ORG, or a four-word ORG? We con-
sidered and rejected using hierarchical named enti-
ties in order to keep the annotation task simple. An-
other example that might give an annotator pause is
a phrase like ’White House’ can be used as a LOC
or ORG, depending on the context.

This measure can act as a measure of a worker’s
quality: if they label many things as “uncertain”,
we might guess that they are not producing good
results in general. Also, the uncertainty allows for
a finer-grained measure of how closely the results
from two workers for the same tweet match: if the
workers disagree on the tagging of a particular word,
but agree that it is not certain, we could decide that
this word is a bad example and not use it as training
data.

Finally, a help screen is available. When the user
mouses over the word “Help” in the upper right, the
guidelines discussed in Section 3 are displayed. The
screenshot in Figure 3 shows the help dialog ex-
panded.

The MTurk interface uses hand-written Javascript
to produce the table of words, radio buttons, and

our data.

checkboxes. The form elements have automatically
generated names, which MTurk handles neatly. Ad-
ditional Javascript code collects location informa-
tion from the workers, based on their IP address. A
service provided by Geobytes3 provides the location
data.

4 Results from MTurk

Our dataset was broken into HITs of four previ-
ously unlabeled tweets, and one previously labeled
tweet (analogous to the “gold” data used by Crowd-
Flower). We submitted 251 HITs, each of which was
to be completed twice, and the job took about 15
hours. Total cost for this job was $27.61, for a total
cost per tweet of about 2.75 cents each (although we
also paid to have the gold tweets annotated again).
42 workers participated, mostly from the US and
India, with Australia in a distant third place. Most
workers did only a single HIT, but most HITs were
done by a single worker. Figure 4 shows more detail.

After collecting results from MTurk, we had to
come up with a strategy for determining which
of the results (if any) were filled randomly. To
do this, we implemented an algorithm much like
Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) to judge
the amount of inter-worker agreement. Pseudocode
for our algorithm is presented in Figure 5.

This algorithm doesn’t strictly measure worker
quality, but rather worker agreement, so it’s impor-

Figure 5: Intra-worker agreement algorithm. MTurk results are
stored in an associative array, with worker IDs as keys and lists
of HIT results as values, and worker scores are floating point
values. Worker IDs are mapped to integers to allow standard
matrix notation. The Similarity function in line four just returns
the fraction of HITs done by two workers where their annota-
tions agreed.

tant to ensure that the workers it judges as having
high agreement values are actually making high-
quality judgements. Figure 6 shows the worker
agreement values plotted against the number of re-
sults a particular worker completed. The slope of
this plot (more results returned tends to give higher
scores) is interpreted to be because practice makes
perfect: the more HITs a worker completes, the
more experience they have with the task, and the
more accurate their results will be.

So, with this agreement metric established, we set
out to find out how well it agreed with our expecta-
tion that it would also function as a quality metric.
Consider those workers that completed only a sin-
gle HIT (there are 18 of them): how well did they
do their jobs, and where did they end up ranked as a
result? Since each HIT is composed of five tweets,

84



Figure 6: This log-log plot of worker agreement scores versus
the number of results clearly shows that workers who have done
more HITs have better inter-annotator agreement scores.

even such a small sample can contain a lot of data.
Figure 7 shows a sample annotation for three

tweets, each from a worker who did only one HIT,
and the ranking that the worker received for doing
that annotation. The worst scoring one is apparently
a random fill: there’s no correlation at all between
the answers and the correct ones. The middle tweet
is improved: “Newbie” isn’t a person in this con-
text, but it’s a mistake a non-native speaker might
make, and everything else is right, and the score is
higher. The last tweet is correctly labeled within our
parameters, and scores the highest. This experiment
shows that our agreement metric functions well as a
correctness metric.

Also of interest is the raw effectiveness of MTurk
workers; did they manage to tag tweets as well as
our experts? After investigating the data, our verdict
is that the answer is not quite—but by carefully com-
bining the tags that two people give the same tweet
it is possible to get good answers nevertheless, at
much lower cost than employing a single expert.

5 Results from CrowdFlower

Our CrowdFlower task involved 30 tweets. Each
tweet was further split into tokens resulting in 506
units as interpreted by CrowdFlower’s system. We
required a total 986 judgments. In addition, we were

Figure 7: These sample annotations represent the range of
worker quality for three workers who did only one HIT. The
first is an apparently random annotation, the second a plausible
but incorrect one, and the third a correct annotation. Our algo-
rithm assigned these workers scores aligned with their product

required to generate thirteen “gold” data, which is
the minimum required by the service. Every gold
answer has an optional text with it to inform work-
ers why we believe our answer is the correct one and
theirs is incorrect. This facilitates gradually train-
ing workers up to the point where they can provide
reliably correct results. Figure 8 shows the inter-
face CrowdFlower provides to monitor the number
of judgements in each category.

We used the calibration interface that Crowd-
Flower provides to fix the price for our task (Fig-
ure 9). It considers various parameters like the time
required per unit and desired accuracy level, and also
adds a flat 33% markup on the actual labor costs. We
divided the task into a set of assignments where each
assignment had three tweets and was paid five cents.
We set the time per unit as 30 seconds, so, based on
the desired accuracy level and markup overhead, our
job’s cost was $2.19. This comes to $2 hourly pay
per worker, assuming they take the whole 30 sec-

onds to complete the task.

6 Cloud Comparison

MTurk can also be used to efficiently evaluate re-
sults requiring human judgments. We implemented
an additional HIT to evaluate a new technique we
developed to generate “word clouds.” In this task
workers choose which of two word clouds generated
from query results by two different algorithms pro-
vides a more useful high level description that can
highlight important features and opinions about the
query topic.

Evaluating how well a set of words describes
and highlights the important features and opinions
pertaining to the subject of the query is subjec-
tive, which necessitates human evaluations. MTurk
workers were given two word clouds, one from our
technique and the other from a baseline relevance
feedback technique (Rocchio (Rocchio, 1971)), for
each query. Queries were shown with a short de-
scriptive blurb to disambiguate it from possible al-
ternatives, reveal the intent of the user who created
the query, and provide a short description of it for
workers who were unfamiliar with the query subject.
Wikipedia links were provided, when applicable, for
anyone needing further information about the query
subject. Workers were asked to use a slider to de-
termine which cloud better represented the key con-
cepts related to the query. The slider would snap
into one of eleven positions, which were labeled
with value judgments they represented. The cen-
ter value indicates that the two clouds were equally
good. Figure 10 shows the final query interface.

Figure 10: MTurk workers were asked which word cloud they
thought best represented returned the results of a query, in this
case “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”.

6.1 Results

Since MTurk workers are paid per task they com-
plete, there is an incentive to do low quality work
and even to randomly guess to get tasks done as
fast as possible. To ensure a high quality evaluation
we included in every batch of five queries a qual-
ity control question. Quality control questions were
designed to look exactly like the regular cloud com-
parisons, but only one of the two clouds displayed
was actually from the query in the description. The
other word cloud was generated from a different
query with no relation to the real query, and hand
checked to make sure that anyone who was doing a
respectable job would agree that the off-topic word
cloud was a poor result for the query. If a worker’s
response indicated that the off topic cloud was as
good as or better than the real cloud then they failed
that control question, otherwise they passed.

86



We asked that twelve workers label each set of
questions. We only used results from workers that
answered at least seven control questions with an
average accuracy rating of at least 75%. This left
us with a pool of eight reliable workers with an av-
erage accuracy on control questions of about 91%.
Every question was labeled by at least five different
workers with a mode of seven.

Workers were not told which technique produced
which cloud. Techniques were randomly assigned to
either cloud A or B to prevent people from entering
into a “cloud A is always better” mentality. The po-
sition of the quality control questions were randomly
assigned in each set of five cloud comparisons. The
links to the cloud images were anonymized to ran-
dom numbers followed by the letter A or B for their
position to prevent workers from guessing anything
about either the query or the technique that gener-
ated the cloud.

We applied a filter to remove the query words
from all word clouds. First of all, it would be a
dead giveaway on the control questions. Second,
the query words are already known and thus pro-
vide no extra information about the query to the user
while simultaneously taking up the space that could
be used to represent other more interesting words.
Third, their presence and relative size compared to
the baseline could cause users to ignore other fea-
tures especially when doing a quick scan.

The slider scores were converted into numerical
scores ranging from -5 to +5, with zero represent-
ing that the two clouds were equal. We averaged
the score for each cloud comparison, and determined
that for 44 out of 55 clouds workers found our tech-
nique to be better than the baseline approach.

6.2 Issues
We faced some issues with the CrowdFlower sys-
tem. These included incorrect calibration for jobs,
errors downloading results from completed jobs,
price displayed on MTurk being different that what
was set through CrowdFlower and gold standard
data not getting stored on CrowdFlower system. An-
other problem was with the system’s 10-token limit
on gold standards, which is not yet resolved at the
time of this writing. On the whole, the CrowdFlower
team has been very quick to respond to our problems
and able to correct the problems we encountered.

Figure 11: Statistics for worker #181799. The interface has an
option to “forgive” the worker for missing gold and an option
to “flag” the worker so that the answers are excluded while re-
turning the final set of judgments. It also displays workers ID,
past accuracy and source, e.g. MTurk.

6.3 Live Analytics

CrowdFlower’a analytics panel facilitates viewing
the live responses. The trust associated with each
worker can be seen under the workers panel. Work-
ers who do a large amount of work with low trust are
likely scammers or automated bots. Good gold data
ensures that their work is rejected. The system auto-
matically pauses a job when the ratio of untrusted to
trusted judgments exceeds a certain mark. This was
particularly helpful for us to rectify some of our gold
data. Currently, the job is being completed with 61%
accuracy for gold data. This could be due to the cur-
rent issue we are facing as described above. It’s also
possible to view statistics for individual workers, as
shown in Figure 11.

7 Conclusion

Crowdsourcing is an effective way to collect annota-
tions for natural language and information retrieval
research. We found both MTurk and CrowdFlower
to be flexible, relatively easy to use, capable of pro-
ducing usable data, and very cost effective.

Some of the extra features and interface options
that CrowdFlower provided were very useful, but
did their were problems with their “gold standard”
agreement evaluation tools. Their support staff was
very responsive and helpful, mitigating some of
these problems. We were able to duplicate some of
the “gold standard” functionality on MTurk directly
by generating our own mix of regular and quality
control queries. We did not attempt to provide im-

87



mediate feedback to workers who enter a wrong an-
swer for the “gold standard” queries, however.

With these labeled tweets, we plan to train an en-
tity recognizer using the Stanford named entity rec-
ognizer4, and run it on our dataset. After using this
trained entity recognizer to find the entities in our
data, we will compare its accuracy to the existing
recognized entities, which were recognized by an
ER trained on newswire articles. We will also at-
tempt to do named entity linking and entity resolu-
tion on the entire corpus.

We look forward to making use of the data we
collected in our research and expect that we will use
these services in the future when we need human
judgements.
