Abstract

We present a data-driven approach to generat-
ing responses to Twitter status posts, based on
phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation.
We find that mapping conversational stimuli
onto responses is more difficult than translat-
ing between languages, due to the wider range
of possible responses, the larger fraction of
unaligned words/phrases, and the presence of
large phrase pairs whose alignment cannot be
further decomposed. After addressing these
challenges, we compare approaches based on
SMT and Information Retrieval in a human
evaluation. We show that SMT outperforms
IR on this task, and its output is preferred over
actual human responses in 15% of cases. As
far as we are aware, this is the first work to
investigate the use of phrase-based SMT to di-
rectly translate a linguistic stimulus into an ap-
propriate response.

1 Introduction

Recently there has been an explosion in the number
of people having informal, public conversations on
social media websites such as Facebook and Twit-
ter. This presents a unique opportunity to build
collections of naturally occurring conversations that
are orders of magnitude larger than those previously
available. These corpora, in turn, present new op-
portunities to apply data-driven techniques to con-
versational tasks.

We investigate the problem of response genera-
tion: given a conversational stimulus, generate an
appropriate response. Specifically, we employ a

large corpus of status-response pairs found on Twit-
ter to create a system that responds to Twitter status
posts. Note that we make no mention of context, in-
tent or dialogue state; our goal is to generate any re-
sponse that fits the provided stimulus; however, we
do so without employing rules or templates, with the
hope of creating a system that is both flexible and
extensible when operating in an open domain.

Success in open domain response generation
could be immediately useful to social media plat-
forms, providing a list of suggested responses to a
target status, or providing conversation-aware auto-
complete for responses in progress. These features
are especially important on hand-held devices (Has-
selgren et al., 2003). Response generation should
also be beneficial in building “chatterbots” (Weizen-
baum, 1966) for entertainment purposes or compan-
ionship (Wilks, 2006). However, we are most ex-
cited by the future potential of data-driven response
generation when used inside larger dialogue sys-
tems, where direct consideration of the user’s utter-
ance could be combined with dialogue state (Wong
and Mooney, 2007; Langner et al., 2010) to generate
locally coherent, purposeful dialogue.

In this work, we investigate statistical machine
translation as an approach for response generation.
We are motivated by the following observation: In
naturally occurring discourse, there is often a strong
structural relationship between adjacent utterances
(Hobbs, 1985). For example, consider the stimulus-
response pair from the data:

Stimulus: I’m slowly making this soup
...... and it smells gorgeous!

583



Response: I’ll bet it looks delicious too!
Haha

Here “it” in the response refers to “this soup” in
the status by co-reference; however, there is also a
more subtle relationship between the “smells” and
“looks”, as well as “gorgeous” and “delicious”. Par-
allelisms such as these are frequent in naturally oc-
curring conversations, leading us to ask whether it
might be possible to translate a stimulus into an ap-
propriate response. We apply SMT to this problem,
treating Twitter as our parallel corpus, with status
posts as our source language and their responses as
our target language. However, the established SMT
pipeline cannot simply be applied out of the box.

We identify two key challenges in adapting SMT
to the response generation task. First, unlike bilin-
gual text, stimulus-response pairs are not semanti-
cally equivalent, leading to a wider range of possible
responses for a given stimulus phrase. Furthermore,
both sides of our parallel text are written in the same
language. Thus, the most strongly associated word
or phrase pairs found by off-the-shelf word align-
ment and phrase extraction tools are identical pairs.
We address this issue with constraints and features to
limit lexical overlap. Secondly, in stimulus-response
pairs, there are far more unaligned words than in
bilingual pairs; it is often the case that large portions
of the stimulus are not referenced in the response
and vice versa. Also, there are more large phrase-
pairs that cannot be easily decomposed (for example
see figure 2). These difficult cases confuse the IBM
word alignment models. Instead of relying on these
alignments to extract phrase-pairs, we consider all
possible phrase-pairs in our parallel text, and apply
an association-based filter.

We compare our approach to response genera-
tion against two Information Retrieval or nearest
neighbour approaches, which use the input stimu-
lus to select a response directly from the training
data. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages
of each approach, and perform an evaluation using
human annotators from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.
Along the way, we investigate the utility of SMT’s
BLEU evaluation metric when applied to this do-
main. We show that SMT-based solutions outper-
form IR-based solutions, and are chosen over actual
human responses in our data in 15% of cases. As far

as we are aware, this is the first work to investigate
the feasibility of SMT’s application to generating re-
sponses to open-domain linguistic stimuli.

2 Related Work

There has been a long history of “chatterbots”
(Weizenbaum, 1966; Isbell et al., 2000; Shaikh et
al., 2010), which attempt to engage users, typically
leading the topic of conversation. They usually limit
interactions to a specific scenario (e.g. a Rogerian
psychotherapist), and use a set of template rules for
generating responses. In contrast, we focus on the
simpler task of generating an appropriate response
to a single utterance. We leverage large amounts of
conversational training data to scale to our Social
Media domain, where conversations can be on just
about any topic.

Additionally, there has been work on generat-
ing more natural utterances in goal-directed dia-
logue systems (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Rambow et al.,
2001). Currently, most dialogue systems rely on ei-
ther canned responses or templates for generation,
which can result in utterances which sound very
unnatural in context (Chambers and Allen, 2004).
Recent work has investigated the use of SMT in
translating internal dialogue state into natural lan-
guage (Langner et al., 2010). In addition to dialogue
state, we believe it may be beneficial to consider
the user’s utterance when generating responses in or-
der to generate locally coherent discourse (Barzilay
and Lapata, 2005). Data-driven generation based on
users’ utterances might also be a useful way to fill in
knowledge gaps in the system (Galley et al., 2001;
Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995).

Statistical machine translation has been applied to
a smörgåsbord of NLP problems, including question
answering (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003), semantic
parsing and generation (Wong and Mooney, 2006;
Wong and Mooney, 2007), summarization (Daumé
III and Marcu, 2009), generating bid-phrases in on-
line advertising (Ravi et al., 2010), spelling correc-
tion (Sun et al., 2010), paraphrase (Dolan et al.,
2004; Quirk et al., 2004) and query expansion (Rie-
zler et al., 2007). Most relevant to our efforts is the
work by Soricut and Marcu (2006), who applied the
IBM word alignment models to a discourse order-
ing task, exploiting the same intuition investigated

584



in this paper: certain words (or phrases) tend to trig-
ger the usage of other words in subsequent discourse
units. As far as we are aware, ours is the first work
to explore the use of phrase-based translation in gen-
erating responses to open-domain linguistic stimuli,
although the analogy between translation and dia-
logue has been drawn (Leuski and Traum, 2010).

3 Data

For learning response-generation models, we use
a corpus of roughly 1.3 million conversations
scraped from Twitter (Ritter et al., 2010; Danescu-
Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011). Twitter conversations
don’t occur in real-time as in IRC; rather as in email,
users typically take turns responding to each other.
Twitter’s 140 character limit, however, keeps con-
versations chat-like. In addition, the Twitter API
maintains a reference from each reply to the post
it responds to, so unlike IRC, there is no need for
conversation disentanglement (Elsner and Charniak,
2008; Wang and Oard, 2009). The first message of a
conversation is typically unique, not directed at any
particular user but instead broadcast to the author’s
followers (a status message). For the purposes of
this paper, we limit the data set to only the first two
utterances from each conversation. As a result of
this constraint, any system trained with this data will
be specialized for responding to Twitter status posts.

4 Response Generation as Translation

When applied to conversations, SMT models the
probability of a response r given the input status-
post s using a log-linear combination of feature
functions. Most prominent among these features
are the conditional phrase-translation probabilities
in both directions, P (s|r) and P (r|s), which ensure
r is an appropriate response to s, and the language
model P (r), which ensures r is a well-formed re-
sponse. As in translation, the response models are
estimated from counts of phrase pairs observed in
the training bitext, and the language model is built
using n-gram statistics from a large set of observed
responses. To find the best response to a given input
status-post, we employ the Moses phrase-based de-
coder (Koehn et al., 2007), which conducts a beam
search for the best response given the input, accord-
ing to the log-linear model.

is easy. There is a clear correspondence between words
in the status and the response.

4.1 Challenge: Lexical Repetition
When applied directly to conversation data, off-the-
shelf MT systems simply learn to parrot back the
input, sometimes with slight modification. For ex-
ample, directly applying Moses with default settings
to the conversation data produces a system which
yields the following (typical) output on the above
example:

Stimulus: I’m slowly making this soup
...... and it smells gorgeous!

Response: i’m slowly making this soup
...... and you smell gorgeous!

This “paraphrasing” phenomenon occurs because
identical word pairs are frequently observed together
in the training data. Because there is a wide range
of acceptable responses to any status, these identical
pairs have the strongest associations in the data, and
therefore dominate the phrase table. In order to dis-
courage lexically similar translations, we filter out
all phrase-pairs where one phrase is a substring of
the other, and introduce a novel feature to penalize
lexical similarity:

φlex(s, t) = J(s, t)

Where J(s, t) is the Jaccard similarity between the
set of words in s and t.

4.2 Challenge: Word Alignment
Alignment is more difficult in conversational data
than bilingual data (Brown et al., 1990), or textual
entailment data (Brockett, 2006; MacCartney et al.,
2008). In conversational data, there are some cases
in which there is a decomposable alignment between

words, as seen in figure 1, and some difficult cases
where alignment between large phrases is required,
for example figure 2. These difficult sentence pairs
confuse the IBM word alignment models which have
no way to distinguish between the easy and hard
cases.

We aligned words in our parallel data using the
widely used tool GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003);
however, the standard growing heuristic resulted in
very noisy alignments. Precision could be improved
considerably by using the intersection of GIZA++
trained in two directions (s→ r, and r → s), but the
alignment also became extremely sparse. The aver-
age number of alignments-per status/response pair
in our data was only 1.7, as compared to a dataset
of aligned French-English sentence pairs (the WMT
08 news commentary data) where the average num-
ber of intersection alignments is 14.

Direct Phrase Pair Extraction

Because word alignment in status/response pairs is
a difficult problem, instead of relying on local align-
ments for extracting phrase pairs, we exploit infor-
mation from all occurrences of the pair in determin-

C(s, t) C(s,¬t) C(s)
C(¬s, t) C(¬s,¬t) N − C(s)
C(t) N − C(t) N

ing whether its phrases form a valid mapping.
We consider all possible phrase-pairs in the train-

ing data,1 then use Fisher’s Exact Test to filter out
pairs with low correlation (Johnson et al., 2007).
Given a source and target phrase s and t, we consider
the contingency table illustrated in figure 3, which
includes co-occurrence counts for s and t, the num-
ber of sentence-pairs containing s, but not t and vice
versa, in addition to the number of pairs containing
neither s nor t. Fisher’s Exact Test provides us with
an estimate of the probability of observing this table,
or one more extreme, assuming s and t are indepen-
dent; in other words it gives us a measure of how
strongly associated they are. In contrast to statistical
tests such as χ2, or the G2 Log Likelihood Ratio,
Fisher’s Exact Test produces accurate p-values even
when the expected counts are small (as is extremely
common in our case).

In Fisher’s Exact Test, the hypergeometric proba-
bility distribution is used to compute the exact prob-
ability of a particular joint frequency assuming a
model of independence:

C(s)!C(¬s)!C(t)!C(¬t)!
N !C(s, t)!C(¬s, t)!C(s,¬t)!C(¬s,¬t)!

The statistic is computed by summing the prob-
ability for the joint frequency in Table 3, and ev-
ery more extreme joint frequency consistent with the
marginal frequencies. Moore (2004) illustrates sev-
eral tricks which make this computation feasible in
practice.

We found that this approach generates phrase-
table entries which appear quite reasonable upon
manual inspection. The top 20 phrase-pairs (after fil-
tering out identical source/target phrases, substrings,

1We define a possible phrase-pair as any pair of phrases
found in a sentence-pair from our training corpus, where both
phrases consist of 4 tokens or fewer. The total number of phrase
pairs in a sentence pair (s, r) is O(|s| × |r|).

and symmetric pairs) are listed in Table 1.2 Our ex-
periments in §6 show that using the phrase table pro-
duced by Fisher’s Exact Test outperforms one gen-
erated based on the poor quality IBM word align-
ments.

4.3 System Details

For the phrase-table used in the experiments (§6) we
used the 5M phrases with highest association ac-
cording the Fisher Exact Test statistic.3 To build
the language model, we used all of the 1.3M re-
sponses from the training data, along with roughly
1M replies collected using Twitter’s streaming API.

2See the supplementary materials for the top 10k (unfiltered)
phrase pairs.

3Note that this includes an arbitrary subset of the (1,1,1)
pairs (phrase pairs where both phrases were only observed once
in the data). Excluding these (1,1,1) pairs yields a rather small
phrase table, 201K phrase-pairs after filtering, while including
all of them led to a table which was too large for the memory of
the machine used to conduct the experiments.

We do not use any form of SMT reordering
model, as the position of the phrase in the response
does not seem to be very correlated with the corre-
sponding position in the status. Instead we let the
language model drive reordering.

We used the default feature weights provided by
Moses.4 Because automatic evaluation of response
generation is an open problem, we avoided the use of
discriminative training algorithms such as Minimum
Error-Rate Training (Och, 2003).

5 Information Retrieval

One straightforward data-driven approach to re-
sponse generation is nearest neighbour, or informa-
tion retrieval. This general approach has been ap-
plied previously by several authors (Isbell et al.,
2000; Swanson and Gordon, 2008; Jafarpour and
Burges, 2010), and is used as a point of compari-
son in our experiments. Given a novel status s and a
training corpus of status/response pairs, two retrieval
strategies can be used to return a best response r′:

IR-STATUS [rargmaxi sim(s,si)] Retrieve the re-
sponse ri whose associated status message si
is most similar to the user’s input s.

IR-RESPONSE [rargmaxi sim(s,ri)] Retrieve the re-
sponse ri which has highest similarity when di-
rectly compared to s.

At first glance, IR-STATUS may appear to be the
most promising option; intuitively, if an input status
is very similar to a training status, we might expect
the corresponding training response to pair well with
the input. However, as we describe in §6, it turns
out that directly retrieving the most similar response
(IR-RESPONSE) tends to return acceptable replies
more reliably, as judged by human annotators. To
implement our two IR response generators, we rely
on the default similarity measure implemented in the
Lucene5 Information Retrieval Library, which is an
IDF-weighted Vector-Space similarity.

6 Experiments

In order to compare various approaches to auto-
mated response generation, we used human evalu-

ators from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Snow et al.,
2008). Human evaluation also provides us with data
for a preliminary investigation into the feasibility
of automatic evaluation metrics. While automated
evaluation has been investigated in the area of spo-
ken dialogue systems (Jung et al., 2009), it is unclear
how well it will correlate with human judgment in
open-domain conversations where the range of pos-
sible responses is very large.

6.1 Experimental Conditions
We performed pairwise comparisons of several
response-generation systems. Similar work on eval-
uating MT output (Bloodgood and Callison-Burch,
2010) has asked Turkers to rank more than two
choices, but in order to keep our evaluation as
straightforward as possible, we limited our experi-
ments to pairwise comparisons.

For each experiment comparing 2 systems (a and
b), we built a test set by selecting a random sam-
ple of 200 tweets which had received responses,
and which had a length between 4 and 20 words.
These tweets were selected from conversations col-
lected from a later, non-overlapping time-period
from those used in training. Each experiment used
a different random sample of 200 tweets. For each
of the 200 statuses, we generated a response using
method a and b, then showed the status and both re-
sponses to the Turkers, asking them to choose the
best response. The order of the systems used to
generate a response was randomized, and each of
the 200 HITs was submitted to 3 different Turkers.
Turkers were paid 1¢ per judgment.

The Turkers were instructed that an appropriate
response should be on the same topic as the sta-
tus, and should also “make sense” in response to it.
While this is an inherently subjective task, from in-
specting the results, we found Turkers to be quite
competent in judging between two responses.

The systems used in these pairwise comparisons
are summarized in table 2, and example output gen-
erated by each system is presented in Table 3.

6.2 Results
The results of the experiments are summarized in
Table 4. For each experiment we show the fraction
of HITs where the majority of annotators agreed sys-
tem a was better. We also show the p-value from an

ferences are significant with above 95% confidence.
Table 4 also shows the S coefficient (Bennett et al.,
1954) as a measure of agreement between annotators
for each experiment. S is equivalent the commonly
used Kappa, except it assumes the uniform distribu-
tion when computing expected or chance agreement
(Artstein and Poesio, 2008). The uniform distribu-
tion is appropriate in our setup, since annotators are
not told which system generated each output, and the
order of choices is randomized. If annotators were
indeed choosing randomly, they would be expected
to agree in 50% of cases. In most comparisons the
value of S is in the range of 0.2 to 0.4, which can
be considered “Fair agreement” (Landis and Koch,
1977).

Note that agreement between annotators is lower
than typically reported in corpus annotation tasks.
When annotating which of two automatically gen-
erated outputs is better, there is not always a clear
answer; both responses might be good or bad. We
can expect strong agreement only in cases where
one response is clearly better. Strong agreement is
not required, however, as we are using many anno-
tations to compare each pair of systems, and the hu-
man judgments are not intended to be used as train-
ing data. Similar agreement was reported in an eval-
uation of automatically generated MT output as part

of the WMT09 shared tasks (Callison-Burch et al.,
2009).6

The results of the paired evaluations provide a
clear ordering on the automatic systems: IR-STATUS
is outperformed by IR-RESPONSE, which is in turn
outperformed by MT-CHAT. These results are
somewhat surprising. We had expected that match-
ing status to status would create a more natural and
effective IR system, but in practice, it appears that
the additional level of indirection employed by IR-
STATUS created only more opportunity for confu-
sion and error. Also, we did not necessarily expect
MT-CHAT’s output to be preferred by human anno-
tators: the SMT system is the only one that generates
a completely novel response, and is therefore the
system most likely to make fluency errors. We had
expected human annotators to pick up on these flu-
ency errors, giving the the advantage to the IR sys-
tems. However, it appears that MT-CHAT’s ability
to tailor its response to the status on a fine-grained
scale overcame the disadvantage of occasionally in-
troducing fluency errors.7

Given MT-CHAT’s success over the IR systems,
we conducted further experiments to validate its out-
put. In order to test how close MT-CHAT’s responses
come to human-level abilities, we compared its out-
put to actual human responses from our dataset. In
some cases the human responses change the topic of
conversation, and completely ignore the initial sta-
tus. For instance, one frequent type of response we
noticed in the data was a greeting: “How have you
been? I haven’t talked to you in a while.” For the
purposes of this evaluation, we manually filtered out
cases where the human response was completely off-
topic from the status, selecting 200 pairs at random
that met our criteria and using the actual responses
as the HUMAN output.

When compared to the actual human-generated
response, MT-CHAT loses. However, its output is
preferred over the human responses 15% of the time,
a fact that is particularly surprising given the very
small – by MT standards – amount of data used to
train the model. A few examples where MT-CHAT’s
output were selected over the human response are

ble 3, fluency errors are rampant across all systems, including
the gold-standard human responses.

listed in Table 5.
We also evaluated the effect of filtering all possi-

ble phrase pairs using Fisher’s Exact Test, which we
did instead of conducting phrase extraction accord-
ing to the very noisy word alignments. We altered
our MT-CHAT system to use the standard Moses
phrase-extraction pipeline, creating the system de-
noted as MT-BASELINE. We compared this to the
complete MT-CHAT system. Note that both systems
account for lexical repetition as described in §4.1.
MT-CHAT’s output is preferred 58% of the time over
MT-BASELINE, indicating that direct phrase extrac-
tion is useful in this conversational setting.

Finally, as an additional baseline, we compared
MT-CHAT’s output to random responses selected
from those observed 2 or more times in the train-
ing data. One might argue that short, common re-
sponses are very general, and that a reply like “lol”
could be considered a good response to almost any
status. However, the human evaluation shows a clear
preference for MT-CHAT’s output: raters favour re-
sponses that are tailored to the stimulus.

6.3 Automatic Evaluation

The field of SMT has benefited greatly from
the existence of an automatic evaluation metric,
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which grades an out-
put candidate according to n-gram matches to one or
more reference outputs. To evaluate whether BLEU
is an appropriate automatic evaluation measure for
response generation, we attempted to measure its
agreement with the human judgments. We calcu-
late BLEU using a single reference derived from our
parallel corpus. We show the smoothed BLEU 1-4
scores for each system on each dataset evaluated in
Table 4. Although these scores are extremely low,
the overall BLEU scores agree with overall annota-
tor judgments in all cases except when comparing
MT-CHAT and IR-RESPONSE. It would seem that
BLEU has some agreement with human judgments
on this task, but perhaps not enough to be immedi-
ately useful.

7 Conclusions

We have presented several data-driven approaches,
based on information retrial and phrase-based SMT,
to the task of automatically responding to open-

Our experiments show that SMT techniques are

better-suited than IR approaches on the task of re-
sponse generation. Our system, MT-CHAT, pro-
duced responses which were preferred by human an-
notators over actual human responses 15% of the
time. Although this is still far from human-level
performance, we believe there is much room for
improvement: from designing appropriate word-
alignment and decoding algorithms that account for
the selective nature of response in dialogue, to sim-
ply adding more training data.

We described the many challenges posed by
adapting phrase-based SMT to dialogue, and pre-
sented initial solutions to several, including direct
phrasal alignment, and phrase-table scores discour-
aging responses that are lexically similar to the sta-
tus. Finally, we have provided results from an initial
experiment to evaluate the BLEU metric when ap-
plied to response generation, showing that though
the metric as is does not work well, there is suffi-
cient correlation to suggest that a similar, dialogue-
focused approach may be feasible.

By generating responses to Tweets out of context,
we have demonstrated that the models underlying
phrase-based SMT are capable of guiding the con-
struction of appropriate responses. In the future, we
are excited about the role these models could po-
tentially play in guiding response construction for
conversationally-aware chat input schemes, as well
as goal-directed dialogue systems.
