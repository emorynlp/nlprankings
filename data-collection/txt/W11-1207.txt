Abstract

In this paper, we present two methods to use
a noisy parallel news corpus to improve sta-
tistical machine translation (SMT) systems.
Taking full advantage of the characteristics of
our corpus and of existing resources, we use
a bootstrapping strategy, whereby an existing
SMT engine is used both to detect parallel sen-
tences in comparable data and to provide an
adaptation corpus for translation models. MT
experiments demonstrate the benefits of vari-
ous combinations of these strategies.

1 Introduction

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), systems
are created from parallel corpora consisting of a set
of source language texts aligned with its translation
in the target language. Such corpora however only
exist (at least are publicly documented and avail-
able) for a limited number of domains, genres, reg-
isters, and language pairs. In fact, there are a few
language pairs for which parallel corpora can be ac-
cessed, except for very narrow domains such as po-
litical debates or international regulatory texts. An-
other very valuable resource for SMT studies, espe-
cially for under-resource languages, are comparable
corpora, made of pairs of monolingual corpora that
contain texts of similar genres, from similar periods,
and/or about similar topics.

The potential of comparable corpora has long
been established as a useful source from which to
extract bilingual word dictionaries (see eg. (Rapp,
1995; Fung and Yee, 1998)) or to learn multilingual
terms (see e.g. (Langé, 1995; Smadja et al., 1996)).

More recently, the relative corpus has caused the
usefulness of comparable corpora be reevaluated as
a potential source of parallel fragments, be they
paragraphs, sentences, phrases, terms, chunks, or
isolated words. This tendency is illustrated by the
work of e.g. (Resnik and Smith, 2003; Munteanu
and Marcu, 2005), which combines Information Re-
trieval techniques (to identify parallel documents)
and sentence similarity detection to detect parallel
sentences.

There are many other ways to improve SMT mod-
els with comparable or monolingual data. For in-
stance, the work reported in (Schwenk, 2008) draws
inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised
training of acoustic models for speech recognition
and proposes to use self-training on in-domain data
to adapt and improve a baseline system trained
mostly with out-of-domain data.

As discussed e.g. in (Fung and Cheung, 2004),
comparable corpora are of various nature: there ex-
ists a continuum between truly parallel and com-
pletely unrelated texts. Algorithms for exploiting
comparable corpora should thus be tailored to the
peculiarities of the data on which they are applied.

In this paper, we report on experiments aimed at
using a noisy parallel corpus made out of news sto-
ries in French and Arabic in two different ways: first,
to extract new, in-domain, parallel sentences; sec-
ond, to adapt our translation and language models.
This approach is made possible due to the specifici-
ties of our corpus. In fact, our work is part of a
project aiming at developing a platform for process-
ing multimedia news documents (texts, interviews,
images and videos) in Arabic, so as to streamline the

work of a major international news agency. As part
as the standard daily work flow, a significant por-
tion of the French news are translated (or adapted)
in Arabic by journalists. Having access to one full
year of the French and Arabic corpus (consisting, to
date, of approximately one million stories (150 mil-
lion words)), we have in our hands an ideal compa-
rable resource to perform large scale experiments.

These experiments aim at comparing various
ways to build an accurate machine translation sys-
tem for the news domain using (i) a baseline system
trained mostly with out-of-domain data (ii) the com-
parable dataset. As will be discussed, given the very
large number of parallel news in the data, our best
option seems to reconstruct an in-domain training
corpus of automatically detected parallel sentences.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we relate our work to some exist-
ing approaches for using comparable corpora. Sec-
tion 3 presents our methodology for extracting par-
allel sentences, while our phrase-table adaptation
strategies are described in Section 4. In Section 5,
we describe our experiments and contrast the results
obtained with several adaptation strategies. Finally,
Section 6 concludes the paper.

2 Related work

From a bird’s eye view, attempts to use comparable
corpora in SMT fall into two main categories: first,
approaches aimed at extracting parallel fragments;
second, approaches aimed at adapting existing re-
sources to a new domain.

2.1 Extracting parallel fragments

Most attempts at automatically extracting parallel
fragments use a two step process (see (Tillmann and
Xu, 2009) for a counter-example): a set of candidate
parallel texts is first identified; within this short list
of possibly paired texts, parallel sentences are then
identified based on some similarity score.

The work reported in (Zhao and Vogel, 2002) con-
centrates on finding parallel sentences in a set of
comparable stories pairs in Chinese/English. Sen-
tence similarity derives from a probabilistic align-
ment model for documents, which enables to recog-
nize parallel sentences based on their length ratio,
as well as on the IBM 1 model score of their word-

to-word alignment. To account for various levels of
parallelism, the model allows some sentences in the
source or target language to remain unaligned.

The work of (Resnik and Smith, 2003) considers
mining a much larger ”corpora” consisting of docu-
ments collected on the Internet. Matched documents
and sentences are primarily detected based on sur-
face and/or formal similarity of the web addresses
or of the page internal structure.

This line of work is developed notably in
(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005): candidate parallel
texts are found using Cross-Lingual Information Re-
trieval (CLIR) techniques; sentence similarity is in-
directly computed using a logistic regression model
aimed at detecting parallel sentences. This formal-
ism allows to enrich baseline features such as the
length ratio, the word-to-word (IBM 1) alignment
scores with supplementary scores aimed at reward-
ing sentences containing identical words, etc. More
recently, (Smith et al., 2010) reported significant im-
provements mining parallel Wikipedia articles us-
ing more sophisticated indicators of sentence par-
allelism, incorporating a richer set of features and
cross-sentence dependencies within a Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) model. For lack of find
enough parallel sentences, (Munteanu and Marcu,
2006; Kumano and Tokunaga, 2007) consider the
more difficult issue of mining parallel phrases.

In (Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009), the authors,
rather than computing a similarity score between a
source and a target sentence, propose to use an ex-
isting translation engine to process the source side
of the corpus, thus enabling sentence comparison to
be performed in the target language, using the edit
distance or variants thereof (WER or TER). This
approach is generalized to much larger collections
in (Uszkoreit et al., 2010), which draw advantage
of working in one language to adopt efficient paral-
lelism detection techniques (Broder, 2000).

2.2 Comparable corpora for adaptation
Another very productive use of comparable corpora
is to adapt or specialize existing resources (dictio-
naries, translation models, language models) to spe-
cific domains and/or genres. We will only focus here
on adapting the translation model; a review of the
literature on language model adaptation is in (Bella-
garda, 2001) and the references cited therein.

Figure 1: Extraction of parallel corpora

The work in (Snover et al., 2008) is a first step
towards augmenting the translation model with new
translation rules: these rules associate, with a tiny
probability, every phrase in a source document with
the most frequent target phrases found in a compa-
rable corpus specifically built for this document.

The study in (Schwenk, 2008) considers self-
training, which allows to adapt an existing system
to new domains using monolingual (source) data.
The idea is to automatically translate the source side
of an in-domain corpus using a reference translation
system. Then, according to some confidence score,
the best translations are selected to form an adap-
tation corpus, which can serve to retrain the trans-
lation model. The authors of (Cettolo et al., 2010)
follow similar goals with different means: here, the
baseline translation model is used to obtain a phrase
alignment between source and target sentences in
a comparable corpus. These phrase alignments are
further refined, before new phrases not in the origi-
nal phrase-table, can be collected.

The approaches developed below borrow from
both traditions: given (i) the supposed high degree
of parallelism in our data and (ii) the size of the
available comparable data, we are in a position to
apply any of the above described technique. This
is all the easier to do as all stories are timestamped,
which enables to easily spot candidate parallel texts.
In both cases, we will apply a bootstrapping strat-
egy using as baseline a system trained with out-of-
domain data.

3 Extracting Parallel Corpora

This section presents our approach for extracting a
parallel corpus from a comparable in-domain cor-

pora so as to adapt a SMT system to a specific do-
main. Our methodology assumes that both a base-
line out-of-domain translation system and a compa-
rable in-domain corpus are available, two require-
ments that are often met in practice.

As shown in Figure 1, our approach for extracting
an in-domain parallel corpus from the in-domain
comparable corpus consists in 3 steps and closely
follows (Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009):
translation: translating the source side of the
comparable corpora;
document pairs selection : selecting, in the com-
parable corpus, documents that are similar to the
translated output;
sentence pairs selection : selecting parallel sen-
tences among the selected documents.

The main intuition is that computing document
similarities in one language enables to use simple
and effective comparison procedures, instead of hav-
ing to define ad hoc similarities measures based on
complex underlying alignment models.

The translation step consists here in translating
the source (Arabic) side of the comparable corpus
using a baseline out-of-domain system, which has
been trained on parallel out-of-domain data.

The document selection step consists in trying
to match the automatic translations (source:target)
with the original documents in the target language.
For each (source:target) document, a similarity score
with all the target documents is computed. We con-
tend here with a simple association score, namely
the Dice coefficient, computed as the number of
words in common in both documents, normalized by
the length of the (source:target) document.

A priori knowledge, such as the publication dates

46



of the documents, are used to limit the number of
document pairs to be compared. For each source
document, the target document that has the best
score is then selected as a potential parallel docu-
ment. The resulting pairs of documents are then fil-
tered depending on a threshold Td, so as to avoid
false matches (in the experiments described below,
the threshold has been set so as to favor precision
over recall).

At the end of this step, a set of similar source
and target document pairs has been selected. These
pairs may consist in documents that are exact trans-
lations of each other. In most cases, the documents
are noisy translation and only a subset of their sen-
tences are mutual translation.

The sentence selection step then consists in per-
forming a sentence level alignment of each pair of
documents to select a set of parallel sentences. Sen-
tence alignment is then performed with the hunalign
sentence alignment tool (Varga et al., 2005), which
also provides alignment confidence measures. As
for the document selection step, only sentence pairs
that obtain an alignment score greater than a prede-
fined threshold Ts are selected, where Ts is again
chosen to favor prevision of alignments of recall.
From these, 1 : 1 alignments are retained, yielding
a small, adapted, parallel corpus. This method is
quite different from (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005)’s
work where the sentence selection step is done by a
Maximum Entropy classifier.

4 Domain Adaptation

In the course of mining our comparable corpus, we
have produced a translation into French for all the
source language news stories. This means that we
have three parallel corpora at our disposal:

• The baseline training corpus, which is large
(a hundred million words), delivering a reason-
able translation performance quality of transla-
tion, but out-of-domain;

• The extracted in-domain corpus, which is
much smaller, and potentially noisy;

• The translated in-domain corpus, which is of
medium-size, and much worse in quality than
the others.

Considering these three corpora, different adapta-
tion methods of the translation models are explored.
The first approach is to concatenate the baseline and
in-domain training data (either extracted or trans-
lated) to train a new translation model. Given the
difference in size between the two corpus, this ap-
proach may introduce a bias in the translation model
in favor of out-of-domain.

The second approach is to train separate transla-
tion models with baseline on the one hand, and with
in-domain on the other data and to weight their com-
bination with MERT (Och, 2003). This alleviates
the former problem but increases the number of fea-
tures that need to be trained, running the risk to make
MERT less stable.

A last approach is also considered, which consists
in using only the in-domain data to train the trans-
lation model. In that case, the question is the small
size of the in-domain data.

The comparative experiments on the three ap-
proaches, using the three corpora are described in
next section.

5 Experiments and results

5.1 Context and data

The experiments have been carried out in the con-
text of the Cap Digital SAMAR1 project which aims
at developping a platform for processing multimedia
news in Arabic. Every day, about 250 news in Ara-
bic, 800 in French and in English2 are produced and
accumulated on our disks. News collected from De-
cember 2009 to December 2010 constitute the com-
parable corpora, containing a set of 75,975 news for
the Arabic part and 288,934 news for the French part
(about 1M sentences for Arabic and 5M sentences
for French).

The specificity of this comparable corpus is that
many Arabic stories are known to be translation of
news that were first written in French. The transla-
tions may not be entirely faithful: when translating
a story, the journalist is in fact free to rearrange the
structure, and to some extend, the content of a doc-
ument (see example Figure 2).

In our experiments, the in-domain comparable
corpus then consists in a set of Arabic and French

5.2 Baseline translation system

The baseline out-of-domain translation system was
trained on a corpus of 7.6 million of parallel sen-
tences (see Table 1), that was harvested from pub-
licly available sources on the web: the United Na-
tions (UN) document database, the website of the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Project
Syndicate Web site. The “UN” data constitutes by
far the largest portion of this corpus, from which
only the Project Syndicate documents can be con-
sidered as appropriate for the task at hand.

A 4-gram backoff French language model was
built on 2.4 billion words of running texts, taken
from the parallel data, as well as notably the Giga-
word French corpus.

Table 1: Corpus statistics: total number of tokens
in the French and Arabic sides, Arabic and French
vocabulary size. Numbers are given on the prepro-
cessed data.

Arabic is a rich and morphologically complex lan-
guage, and therefore data preprocessing is necessary
to deal with data scarcity. All Arabic data were pre-
processed by first transliterating the Arabic text with
the BAMA (Buckwalter, 2002) transliteration tool.
Then, the Arabic data are segmented into sentences.
A CRF-based sentence segmenter for Arabic was
built with the Wapiti3 (Lavergne et al., 2010) pack-
age. A morphological analysis of the Arabic text is
then done using the Arabic morphological analyzer
and disambiguation tool MADA (Nizar Habash and
Roth, 2009), with the MADA-D2 since it seems to
be the most efficient scheme for large data (Habash
and Sadat, 2006).

The preprocessed Arabic and French data were
aligned using MGiza++4 (Gao and Vogel, 2008).
The Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) is then used
to make the alignments symmetric using the grow-
diag-final-and heuristic and to extract phrases with
maximum length of 7 words. A distortion model
lexically conditioned on both the Arabic phrases and
French phrases is then trained. Feature weights were
set by running MERT (Och, 2003) on the develop-
ment set.

5.3 Extraction of the in-domain parallel corpus
We follow the method described in Section 3: Ara-
bic documents are first translated into French using
the baseline SMT system. For the document selec-
tion step each translated (ar:fr) document is com-
pared only to the French documents of the same day.
The thresholds for document selection and sentence
selection were respectively set to 0.5 and 0.7. For a
pair of similar documents, the average percentage of
selected sentences is about 43%.

The document selection step allows to select doc-
uments containing around 35% of the total number
of sentences from the initial Arabic part of the com-
parable corpus, a percentage that goes down to 15%
after the sentence alignment step. The resulting in-
domain parallel corpus thus consists in a set of 156K
pairs of parallel sentences. Data collected during the
last month of the period was isolated from the re-
sulting corpus, and was used to randomly extract a
development and a test set of approximately 1,000

checked to evaluate the precision of the approach,
and we found that 97.2% of the sentences were cor-
rectly paired. Table 1 compares the main character-
istics of the three corpora used for training.

5.4 Translation Results
Translation results obtained on the test set are re-
ported in terms of BLEU scores in Table 2, along
with the corresponding phrase table sizes. The dif-
ferent adaptation approaches described in Section 4
were experimented with both extracted and trans-
lated corpora as adaptation corpus (see Section 3).

news domain is very effective. Compared to the
baseline system, all adapted systems obtain much
better results (from 2 to 6 BLEU points). The ex-
tracted system outperforms the baseline system by
5 BLEU points, even though the training set is much
smaller (3.6M compared to 162M tokens). This re-
sult indirectly validates the precision of our method-
ology.

Concatenating the baseline and extracted data to
train a single translation model does not improve
the smaller extracted system, thus maybe reflect-
ing the fact that the large out-of-domain corpus
overwhelms the contribution of the in-domain data.
However, a log-linear combination of the corre-
sponding phrase tables brings a small improvement
(0.8 BLEU point).

Another interesting result comes from the perfor-
mance of the system trained only on the translated
corpus. Without using any filtering of the automatic
translations, this artificial dataset enables to build
another system which outperforms the baseline sys-
tem by 2.5 BLEU points. This is another illustration
of the greater importance of having matched domain
data, even of a poorer quality, than good parallel out-
of-domain sentences (Cettolo et al., 2010).

In the last experiment, all the available in-domain
data (extracted and translated) are used in conjunc-
tion, with a separate phrase-table trained on each
corpus. However, this did not enable to match the
results of the extracted system, a paradoxical result
that remains to be analyzed more carefully. Filtering
automatic translations may be an issue.

A rapid observation of the translations provided
by both the baseline system and the extracted sys-
tem shows that the produced output are quite dif-
ferent. Figure 3 displays two typical examples: the
first one illustrates the different styles in Arabic
(“News” style often put subject “Le ministre russe
des affaires étrangères” before verb “ a prévenu”
or “a averti” — which are semantically equiva-
lent — whereas “UN” style is more classical, with
the verb “Pronostiquait” followed by the subject
“ministre russe des Affaires étrangères”). The sec-
ond one shows how adaptation fixes the transla-

49



tion of words (here “Philip Crowley”) that were not
(correctly) translated by the baseline system (“ukun
FILIP Cruau”).

6 Conclusion

We have presented an empirical study of various
methodologies for (i) extracting a parallel corpus
from a comparable corpus (the so-called “Noisy
Corpus”) and (ii) using in-domain data to adapt a
baseline SMT system. Experimental results, ob-
tained using a large 150 million word Arabic/French
comparable corpus, allow to jointly validate the ex-
traction of the in-domain parallel corpus and the pro-
posed adaptation methods. The best adapted sys-
tem, trained on a combination of the baseline and
the extracted data, improves the baseline by 6 BLEU
points. Preliminary experiments with self-training
also demonstrate the potential of this technique.

As a follow-up, we intend to investigate the evo-
lution of the translation results as a function of the
precision/recall quality of the extracted corpus, and
of the quality of the automatically translated data.
We have also only focused here on the adaptation
of the translation model. We expect to achieve fur-
ther gains when combining these techniques with
LM adaptation techniques.

FUI/SAMAR project funded by the Cap Digi-
tal competitivity cluster.
