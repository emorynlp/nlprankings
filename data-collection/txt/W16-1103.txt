Abstract 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for 

supervised classification of linguistic metaphors in an 

open domain text using Conditional Random Fields 

(CRF). We analyze CRF based classification model 

for metaphor detection using syntactic, conceptual, 

affective, and word embeddings based features which 

are extracted from MRC Psycholinguistic Database 

(MRCPD) and WordNet-Affect. We use word 

embeddings given by Huang et al. to capture 

information such as coherence and analogy between 

words. To tackle the bottleneck of limited coverage of 

psychological features in MRCPD, we employ 

synonymy relations from WordNet
®

.  A comparison 

of our approach with previous approaches shows the 

efficacy of CRF classifier in detecting metaphors. The 

experiments conducted on VU Amsterdam metaphor 

corpus provides an accuracy of more than 92% and F-

measure of approximately 78%. Results shows that 

inclusion of conceptual features improves the recall 

by 5% whereas affective features do not have any 

major impact on metaphor detection in open text. 

1 Introduction 

According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, 

Metaphor1 is defined as “a figure of speech in which 

a word or a phrase literally denoting one kind of 

object or idea is used in place of another to suggest 

a likeness or analogy between them”.  As a literary 

tool, metaphor is popular and widely appreciated for 

the novelty and vividness it provides to an otherwise 

bland text. Contrary to the popular belief that 

metaphor is a tool for poetry, we see vast usage of 

metaphors in common parlance and even in 

scientific discourses like economics, security and

politics. To achieve human computer interaction in 

the true sense, Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

systems need to be enhanced to process and 

understand metaphors and indeed, all kinds of 

figurative speeches in a continuous and open-

domain text. 

Interpreting metaphor in a language is a 

complicated task because the metaphorical meaning 

of a sentence depends on what a speaker actually 

wants to convey irrespective of the literal meaning 

of the words used (Searle, 1985). Thus, the literal 

meaning of words needs to be modified according 

to the contextual presentation of the metaphor 

(Gibbs, 1984). A linguistic metaphor indicates a 

domain that seems incongruous with the 

surrounding context but presents the underlying 

belief by re-conceptualization (Lynne and Deignan, 

2003). Interestingly, we observe that unlike the 

process of metaphor interpretation, a linguistic 

metaphor can be detected by analyzing word 

properties and surrounding words i.e. context, to 

identify the incongruity it causes in the sentence 

without even examining the reconceptualization 

involved. 

 One of the earliest criteria for metaphor 

detection in a text was proposed by Wilks (1978). 

He stated that a metaphorical interpretation is made 

when literal interpretation makes no sense or is out 

of context, a condition known as violation of 

selectional preference, e.g. 

My car drinks gasoline. (Wilks, 1978)  (a) 

However, metaphors occur even without violation 

of selectional preference, e.g. 

All men are animals. (b)

We also observe that combinations such as <car, 

drink> and <drink, gasoline> have very low co-

occurrence frequency in a corpus. Lakoff and 

Johnson (1980) introduced another perspective and 

termed it as conceptual metaphor which regards 

metaphor as a product of cognitive phenomenon, 

and a way to explain abstract concepts such as 

argument by mapping them to concrete ones such as 

war, e.g. 

The committee shot down her ideas one by one. (c) 

Here in (c), the concrete concept, shot is used to 

explain the outright rejection of an abstract concept 

namely, ideas. Thus, conceptual features like 

abstractness (Turney et al., 2011) or concreteness 

(Klebanov et al., 2015), familiarity or rarity 

(Schulder and Hovy, 2014), imageability 

(Strzalkowski et al., 2013) and sensory features 

(Gargett and Barnden, 2015) can improve automatic 

metaphor detection. Recently, Hovy et al. (2013) 

utilized word embeddings by Collobert et al. (2011) 

for capturing coherence and contextual features for 

supervised metaphor detection. 

In this paper, we strive to provide a solution to 

the fundamental problem of metaphor processing 

i.e. metaphor detection in text. We propose a novel 

approach for binary classification of continuous, 

open-domain text into Metaphor or otherwise, using 

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 

2001) and a hybrid feature set. CRF has widespread 

applications in computational linguistics. In 

contrast with (Gedigan et al., 2006) and (Turney et 

al., 2011) which focus on verb and adjective centric 

metaphors, we extend the applicability of CRF to 

detect all kinds of metaphor. The idea is to develop 

an effective and computationally inexpensive 

process to filter out metaphors in an open text. 

Unlike the majority of earlier works which 

focused on utilizing a particular type of feature set, 

we propose a rich and hybrid feature set to cover 

different aspects of a metaphor. We include features 

that pertain to sentence structure, 

psychological/conceptual properties of a word, 

affective interpretation which provides information 

on whether a word conveys a mood, a mental state 

or an emotion and the context of a word's usage 

using word embeddings. We analyze their effect on 

metaphor detection individually and in 

combination. We use Medical Research Council 

Psycholinguistic Database (MRCPD) (Wilson, 

1988) for extracting conceptual features and 

WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) 

for extracting affective features. Further, we employ 

WordNet
® (Fellbaum, 1998) to expand the limited 

coverage of psychological features in MRCPD. We 

utilize word embeddings (Huang et al., 2012) as 

contextual features which provides semantic 

information for a word such as coherence, context, 

relatedness and analogy. 

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 

provides an overview of existing literature on 

detection of metaphor. Section 3 delineates our 

proposed approach for metaphor detection, the 

feature sets used and extension of MRCPD by using 

WordNet
®.  We demonstrate our experiments and 

results in Section 4 and conclude our work in 

Section 5.   

2 Related Work 

Some of the earliest works in metaphor detection 

used concept of violation of selectional preference 

given by Wilks (1978). These include the system 

MIDAS (Martin, 1990) and met* (Fass, 1991), both 

of which are hand-coded rule-based systems. The 

work in (Mason, 2004) introduced a corpus based 

approach viz. CorMet to identify conventional non-

literal phrases from a domain specific text. 

Recently, Baumer et al. (2010) proposed an 

approach based on selectional preference given by 

Resnik (1993) to detect conceptual metaphors. 

Several researchers used clustering based 

techniques to identify non-literalness in text. Birke 

and Sarkar (2006) proposed the Trope Finder 

(TroFi) system to recognize verbs with non-literal 

meaning using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) 

and clustering. However, TroFi doesn't identify the 

type of non-literalness i.e. whether it is a metaphor 

or some other non-literal category such as idiom, 

sarcasm etc. Shutova et al. (2010) pointed out that a 

target concept associated with the same source 

concept are more likely to co-occur in similar 

lexico-syntactic environments. They proposed a 

clustering based technique using grammatical 

relations and lexical features to detect metaphors. In 

(Birke and Sarkar, 2007), the authors introduced the 

concept of Active Learning using an existing 

similarity based WSD algorithm (Karov and 

Edelman, 1998) to annotate a corpus for non-literal 

language. 

19



 
 
 

 

 Some researchers used knowledge 

resources to strengthen the approaches for metaphor 

detection. The work in (Gedigian et al., 2006) 

proposed a technique to detect metaphorical verb 

usage by utilizing existing knowledge sources such 

as WordNet® (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et 

al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 

2002). Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) proposed 

an approach on the basis of violations in co-

occurring noun and verb phrases using WordNet® 

hierarchies. The works in (Mohler et al., 2013) and 

(Wilks et al., 2013) also utilized WordNet® ontology 

for recognizing metaphors. Dunn (2013) proposed a 

domain interaction system namely Measuring and 

Identifying Metaphor in Language (MIMIL) using 

SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2011). The 

default sense of lexical items in a sentence were 

mapped to concepts from SUMO ontology on the 

basis of domain type and event status. Tsvetkov et 

al. (2014) and Bracewell et al. (2014) used the 

concept of hybrid feature set by using features from 

WordNet, MRCPD and vector representations. 

Klebanov et al. (2015) evaluated the effect of 

concreteness as a feature for metaphor detection 

using MRCPD. Gargett and Branden (2015) 

proposed using sensory features to enhance the 

process of metaphor detection using Affective 

Norms for English Word (ANEW) and MRCPD. 

 Ferrari (1996) proposed an approach based 

on the analysis of syntactic patterns and used textual 

cues such as metaphorically, figuratively and like to 

detect metaphors. The works in (Sardinha, 2002; 

Sardinha, 2006) suggested using corpus-based 

metrics such as collocations list, word frequency 

and semantic-distance for metaphor detection. 

Turney et al. (2011) observed that metaphorical 

usage is directly correlated with the degree of 

abstractness in a word’s contextual usage. They 

proposed an approach to identify metaphorical 

verbs and adjectives using an algorithm to calculate 

abstractness given in (Turney and Littman, 2003). 

Hovy et al. (2013) proposed an approach based on 

features derived from syntactic patterns and word 

embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011) to analyze the 

context of a word usage. They used Support Vector 

Machine (SVM) classifier with tree kernels to 

identify metaphorical words. 

Strazalkowski et al. (2013) utilized topic chaining 

and imageability score to identify metaphorical 

usage in text. Neuman et al. (2013) developed a rule 

based approach which combines selectional 

preference and abstractness of words to identify 

metaphors. Schulder and Hovy (2014) proposed a 

statistical domain-independent approach based on a 

metric term relevance derived from Term 

Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). 

A term is categorized as metaphor if the domain 

relevance and common relevance for a given term is 

lower than a predetermined threshold. 

 Our work is different from earlier works in 

terms of improved and rich feature set that we 

employ. Unlike previous works which used a subset 

of conceptual features, we utilize a multifarious 

feature set. Along with that, we introduce different 

affective features which deal with abstract concepts 

like mental state, physical state, and behavioral 

characteristics. We systemically extend the 

coverage of MRCPD to include unavailable terms 

rather than taking average values as in (Gargett and 

Branden, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, CRF 

for metaphor classification has not yet been fully 

investigated, especially in the context of large, and 

overlapping feature set. Hovy et al. (2013) 

compared their proposed approach with CRF. 

However they did not emphasize on the feature set 

and relations which can be exploited while using a 

CRF model. 

3 Proposed Methodology 

Our methodology is based on an innovative applica-

tion of CRF on an amalgamation of syntactic, con-

ceptual, affective and word embeddings based fea-

tures extracted by using corpus and knowledge re-

sources. We now give a detailed description of the 

features that we have employed, our technique for 

expanding the coverage of MRCPD using 

WordNet® and an approach to build a CRF model 
for Metaphor Detection. 

3.1 Feature Set 

We have built a hybrid feature set drawing upon 

traditional features as well as on the basis of our 

inferences from the existing literature that are likely 

to enhance the process of metaphor detection. The 

feature set is categorized into four categories 

namely, Syntactic Feature set, 𝐹𝑆, Conceptual 

feature set, 𝐹𝐶,  Affective feature set, 𝐹𝐴 and 

Contextual feature set, 𝐹𝑋. 

20



 
 
 

 

3.1.1 Syntactic Features 

The set of syntactic features (SF) is defined as a 

feature vector 𝐹𝑆= {𝐹𝑆1 , 𝐹𝑆2 , …, FS5}, based on a word 

attributes, sentence structure and dependency 

between components of a sentence. We use Stanford 

CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) to extract 

following syntactic features: 

1. Lemma: It includes lemmas i.e. the base form, 

for all tokens in the corpus. 

2. PoS: It denotes grammatical word-category 

such as noun, verb etc. for each word in a 

sentence. 

3. Named_Entity_Type: It marks named, 

numerical and temporal entities such as person, 

location, money, number, date, time etc. 

4. Dependency: It provides information about the 

position of a word with respect to grammatical 

structure of a sentence including relations 

between words and modifiers. 

5. Stop_word: It marks a word as content or non-

content word, based on a list of stop-words. 

3.1.2 Conceptual Features 

The set of conceptual features (CF) is defined as a 

feature vector, FC= {FC1 , FC2, …, FC5}, which consists 

of features based on the meaning, abstract attributes 

of a word and its measured impact on a large corpus. 

We use MRCPD (Wilson, 1988), a large 

psycholinguistics database to extract the conceptual 

features of a word enumerated below (Gilhooly and 

Logie, 1980; Paivio and Madigan, 1968; Toglia and 

Battig, 1978). These conceptual features have 

numerical values ranging from 100 to 700. 

1. Concreteness: It is a measurement of the 

ability of a word to refer to concrete concepts. 

2. Familiarity: It refers to a feeling of knowing 

the word or concept behind a word, depending 

upon how commonly the word is used. 

3. Imageability: It refers to the expressiveness of 

a word to evoke a visual image of the concept 

behind the word. 

4. Frequency: It refers to the frequency of 

occurrence of a word sense in the Brown corpus. 

5. Meaningfulness: It is a measure of the 

association of a given word with other words. We 

utilize the Colerado based Meaningfulness 

rating, MEANC. 

3.1.3 Affective Features 

      The set of affective features (AF) is defined as a 

feature vector, FA= {FA1 , FA2 , …, FA5}, based on the 

affective concepts correlated with an affective 

word. We use WordNet Affect (Strapparava and 

Valitutti, 2004) to extract following affective 

features: 

1. Cognitive_State: It denotes mental state or 

feelings such as confusion. Labels mood, 

sensation, emotional response are merged with 

cognitive state label because of very few 

instances and indirect dependence. 

2. Physical_State: It refers to physical or bodily 

state such as illness. 

3. Trait: It denotes characteristics of personality 

such as aggressiveness. 

4. Attitude: The label behavior and attitude are 

merged together as they are interrelated. 

5. Emotion: It refers to emotional state or process 

such as joy, anger. 

3.1.4 Contextual Features 

Word Embeddings provide semantic information 

about a word and are capable of comparing words 

on basis of relatedness, analogy, coherence and con-

text, the criteria we use for metaphor detection as 

well. We use word embeddings by Huang et al. 

(2012) as it captures local i.e. syntactic information 

as well global context based on word's usage in 

large corpus. CWE is trained using local context 

only. Word embeddings are used as contextual fea-

tures (XF) and represented as a 50 dimensional vec-

tor, FX= {FX1 , FX2 , …, FX50}. 

3.2 Extending MRCPD using WordNet 

The MRCPD resource contains linguistic 

information for over 150,000 words. However, 

psycholinguistic features are available only for a 

limited number of words. A total of 8228 words are 

available for Concreteness rating, 9392 for 

Familiarity, 9240 for Imageability and 5450 words 

for Colerado norms based meaningfulness rating 

(Wilson, 1988). As a result, several words which are 

used frequently is not available in the database. Liu 

et al. (2014) proposed extending MRCPD for 

imageability rating using synonymy and hyponymy 

relations from WordNet. We strive to use a rich 

feature set comprising of other features such as 

21



 
 
 

 

concreteness, familiarity and meaningfulness, thus 

expanding MRCPD for all of these features.  

WordNet
®(Princeton University, 2010) is an 

online machine readable lexical database for 

English language developed by Christiane Fellbaum 

at Princeton University. In WordNet®, words are 

grouped on the basis of cognitive concepts known 

as synset, a set of synonymous words. Senses in a 

synset are arranged in a form of a list on the basis of 

decreasing frequency count in the Brown corpus 

(Francis and Kucera, 1979) For example, if we 

search the word, man, we observe that its first sense 

<man#1, adult-male#1> sense has occurred 749 

times in the Brown corpus whereas its second sense 

<homo#2> occurred only 29 times. So, we can say, 

that highest ranked sense is the most frequently used 

sense for a word. We use this inference to prioritize 

senses in our technique to extend the coverage of 

words with psychological features in MRCPD. The 

hyponymy relation provide a more specific instance 

for a concept. E.g. for the word, beverage, we obtain 

{milk, tea, wish-wash, hydromel, oenomel, soft 

drink etc.} as hyponymy concepts. However, 

hydromel, oenomel, wish-wash are relatively less 

familiar, have lower imageability, and have a lower 

probability of co-occurrence with other concepts. 

Therefore, we find it more judicious to consider 

only synonymy relations from WordNet® while 

expanding MRCPD. 

As an example, consider the word, deviance which 

is not in MRCPD. We extract its synset {aberrance, 

aberration, deviation} from WordNet in order of 

decreasing Brown frequency. Next, we check the 

availability of each of these synonyms in MRCPD 

until a match is found. In this case, the word, 

aberration is available in MRCPD.  Therefore, the 

conceptual features for aberration is assigned to 

deviance. Similarly, in case of courtroom, the word 

court is selected as a substitute and its conceptual 

features are extracted. 

3.3 Approach 

The proposed approach is divided in three phases 

namely, Data Processing, Feature Extraction and 

Model Building. 

1. Data Processing phase: This involves data 

cleaning, tokenization and conversion to 
‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒ 
2 CoNLL Data Format: http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/#dataformat 

CoNLL2 data format. After data processing, we 

obtain a sequence of tokens derived from 

sentences of the corpus. 

2. Feature Extraction phase: This is sub-divided 

into four parts: Syntactic Feature Extraction, 

Conceptual Feature Extraction, Affective 

features extraction and Contextual feature 

extraction. The extraction process is explained in 

subsections 3.1 and 3.2. We use a context 

window of 7 words i.e. the word itself, 3 

previous words and 3 next words, whose features 

are used to predict the label/class of a token. 

3. Model Building phase: CRF (Lafferty et al., 

2001) is a probabilistic sequence labelling 

algorithm which takes an input sequence X, and 

predict the class label, Y. Since we are 

performing binary classification, Y consists of 

only two labels namely {M, NM} where M 

stands for metaphor and NM for otherwise cases. 

CRF doesn't make the assumption that features 

are independent and it is capable of handling 

large number of inter-independent or over-

lapping features unlike joint probability based 

models such as HMM which becomes 

intractable in such cases. 

In our approach, these dependencies are 

defined by analyzing their effect on precision 

and recall. Thus, creating a feature set more 

aligned towards precise detection of metaphor 

without compromising recall. Features are 

defined in a template file (in case of CRF++) 

along with the context window and inter-

dependencies between different features such as 

concreteness/pos, imageability/concreteness, 

cognitive_state/concreteness and so on. X1:N is a 

feature vector which is generated on the basis of 

a given template file. The joint distribution for 

the label sequence Y given X is as in eq. (1): 

𝑝(𝑦|𝑥, 𝛼) =
1

𝑍(𝑥)
exp⁡(∑ 𝛼𝑘 ∑ 𝑓(𝑦𝑖−1, 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑥, 𝑖)

𝑛
𝑖𝑘 )   (1) 

Where 𝑓(𝑦𝑖−1, 𝑦𝑖 , 𝑥, 𝑖) is a feature/transition 

function, 𝑦𝑖−1, 𝑦𝑖 are class labels, x is an input 
sequence and i is an input position, Z(x) is a 

Normalization factor and 𝛼𝑘 is a parameter 
vector. The elements of the parameter vector, 

{αk}ϵR
K are calculated from the training data to 

maximize the likelihood of p(y|x).

4 Experiments and Results 

We used CRF++ (V0.58) (Kudo, 2005), an open 

source C++ implementation of CRF based classifier 

for our experiments and VU Amsterdam Metaphor 

Corpus as dataset. 

4.1 Dataset 

We used VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus (Steen et 

al., 2010) developed by MIP Pragglejaz group. The 

annotation for metaphor in a sentence is based on 

anomaly between basic meaning of the term and 

contextual meaning of the term in the given 

sentence (Pragglejaz Group, 2007). The corpus is a 

small set of BNC Baby manually annotated for 

metaphors in XML format. For our experimental 

purpose, we converted the XML dataset into 

CoNLL format. We have considered words marked 

with MRW-Met sub-class as Metaphor and all other 

categories as Non-Metaphor. In original files, total 

number of metaphors is 25496, however in few 

cases we have separated multi-word expressions 

and marked all of them as Metaphor or Not 

Metaphor (whichever is the initial case) which led 

to minor increase in total number of metaphors. We 

have performed 10-fold cross validation across 

every genre as well as on overall dataset say 

Dataset2. The percentage of metaphor in each 

dataset is given in Table1.

4.2 Experiments 

We trained the CRF based classifier on categorized 

datasets in steps to analyze individual effect of 

every feature set. During feature extraction, we 

observed that affective features are too sparse i.e. 

exists in case of affective words only which is 

around 11% (refer Table2). Therefore, affective 

feature set is merged with conceptual feature set to 

analyze its effect on metaphor detection in an open 

domain dataset.

Table 7: Metaphor Detection using CRF classifier on Hybrid 

Feature (SF+CF+AF+XF) set 

Analysis: Extension of MRCPD with WordNet led 

to higher coverage and fewer missing values in 

conceptual feature vector. From the results in Table 

3-4, we observed that inclusion of conceptual 

features significantly improved recall (up to 5%) for 

metaphors however it didn't have any visible effect 

on precision. Due to sparse affective feature vector, 

we could not observe any major impact on either 

precision or recall on adding affective feature set 

(refer Table5). Contextual Features i.e. embeddings 

with Syntactic features was also effective in 

recognizing metaphors but did not supersede the 

feature set {SF+CF} (refer Table4 and Table6). The 

combination {SF, CF, AF} (refer Table5) and {SF, 

CF, AF, XF} (refer Table8) didn't show any 

significant improvement over feature set {SF+CF}. 

We gathered that presence of open category words 

(non-content words) such as determiners, 

conjunction etc. limited the effect of inter-

dependent features. Consider the following 

sentence (metaphors in bold): 

It would be also necessary ‘to smash the decrepit, 

effete constitution that allows a minority to capture 

power, and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of 

the privileged few’. 

Here, smash is used metaphorically. Despite of 

considering a context window of 7 words i.e. also 

necessary to smash the decrepit effete, we were 

unable to capture object of interest, i.e. constitution. 

4.3 Comparison 

We compared our approach with approaches pro-

posed by Dunn (2013), Klebanov et al. (2015) and 

Hovy et al. (2013). Dunn used logistic regression 

classifier implemented in WEKA (Hall, 2009) on 

features extracted from SUMO Ontology. Klebanov 

et al. (2015) used concreteness as a feature with 

baseline features (Klebanov et al., 2014) and opti-

mal weighting technique. The dataset used was VU 

Amsterdam Metaphor corpus. Hovy et al. (2013) 

used SVMlight Tree Kernel (TK) implementation 

by (Moschitti, 2006) with syntactic features and 

CWE. However, they conducted the experiments on 

their own dataset, say Dataset3.

Table 8: Comparison of proposed model with previous 

approaches 

By using CRF as a classifier, there is a significant 

improvement in accuracy and precision in 

comparison to models used in previous approaches. 

From Table8, we observed that CRF based classifier 

with {SF+CF+AF+XF} feature set outperformed 

approaches proposed by Dunn (2013) and Klebanov 

et al. (2015) in terms of accuracy, precision and F-

measure (refer Table8). Klebanov et al. (2015) 

approach was based on optimal weighting to obtain 

optimal F-score which lead to comparatively higher 

recall. It is worth noting that accuracy increased by 

18.96% and precision by 6.19% with respect to 

system proposed by Hovy et al. (2013). However, 

Hovy et al. (2013) outperformed in terms of recall

and F-measure for metaphor class. The problem of 

low recall is likely to be resolved by optimizing the 

model for optimal F-measure as in Klebanov et al. 

(2015). 

5 Conclusion 

We used a CRF based classifier to perform 

metaphor detection in text. Using a rich feature set 

and a wide context window, we demonstrated the 

advantage of using CRF classifier over other 

classifiers in terms of accuracy and precision. We 

analyzed the efficacy of using CRF classifier over 

various combinations of feature sets. We expanded 

the coverage of the conceptual features of MRCPD 

using WordNet® ontology, resulting in significant 

improvement in the recall of metaphor detection. In 

future, we would like to conduct an in-depth 

analysis of affective features, fine-tune the process 

of feature selection and develop a multi-stage model 

for metaphor processing.
