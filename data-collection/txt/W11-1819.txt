Abstract

In this paper we describe a rule-based sys-
tem developed for the BioNLP 2011 GENIA
event detection task. The system applies Ky-
bots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) on anno-
tated texts to extract bio-events involving pro-
teins or genes. The main goal of this work is to
verify the usefulness and portability of the Ky-
bot technology to the domain of biomedicine.

1 Introduction

The aim of the BioNLP’11 Genia Shared Task (Kim
et al., 2011b) concerns the detection of molecular
biology events in biomedical texts using NLP tools
and methods. It requires the identification of events
together with their gene or protein arguments. Nine
event types are considered: localization, binding,
gene expression, transcription, protein catabolism,
phosphorylation, regulation, positive regulation and
negative regulation.

When identifying the events related to the given
proteins, it is mandatory to detect also the event
triggers, together with its associated event-type, and
recognize their primary arguments. There are “sim-
ple” events, concerning an event together with its
arguments (Theme, Site, ...) and also “complex”
events, or events that have other events as secundary
arguments. Our system did not participate in the op-
tional tasks of recognizing negation and speculation.

The training dataset contained 909 texts together
with a development dataset of 259 texts. 347 texts
were used for testing the system.

The main objective of the present work was to ver-
ify the applicability of a new Information Extraction

(IE) technology developed in the KYOTO project1

(Vossen et al., 2008), to a new specific domain. The
KYOTO system comprises a general and extensible
multilingual architecture for the extraction of con-
ceptual and factual knowledge from texts, which has
already been applied to the environmental domain.

Currently, our system follows a rule-based ap-
proach (i.e. (Kim et al., 2009), (Kim et al., 2011a),
(Cohen et al., 2011) or (Vlachos, 2009)), using a set
of manually developed rules.

2 System Description

Our system proceeds in two phases. Firstly, text doc-
uments are tokenized and structured using an XML
layered structure called KYOTO Annotation Format
(KAF) (Bosma et al., 2009). Secondly, a set of Ky-
bots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are applied to de-
tect the biological events of interest occurring in the
KAF documents. Kybots form a collection of gen-
eral morpho-syntactic and semantic patterns on se-
quences of KAF terms. These patterns are defined
in a declarative format using Kybot profiles.

2.1 KAF

Firstly, basic linguistic processors apply segmenta-
tion and tokenization to the text. Additionally, the
offset positions of the proteins given by the task or-
ganizers are also considered. The output of this ba-
sic processing is stored in KAF, where words, terms,
syntactic and semantic information can be stored in
separate layers with references across them.

Currently, our system only considers a minimal
amount of linguistic information. We are only using

the word form and term layers. Figure 1 shows an
example of a KAF document where proteins have
been annotated using a special POS tag (PRT). Note
that our approach did not use any external resource
apart of the basic linguistic processing.

2.2 Kybots

Kybots (Knowledge Yielding Robots) are abstract
patterns that detect actual concept instances and re-
lations in KAF. The extraction of factual knowledge
by the mining module is done by processing these
abstract patterns on the KAF documents. These pat-
terns are defined in a declarative format using Kybot
profiles, which describe general morpho-syntactic
and semantic conditions on sequences of terms. Ky-
bot profiles are compiled to XQueries to efficiently
scan over KAF documents uploaded into an XML
database. These patterns extract and rank the rele-
vant information from each match.

Kybot profiles are described using XML syn-
tax and each one consists of three main declarative
parts:

• Variables: In this part, the entities and its prop-
erties are defined

• Relations: This part specifies the positional re-
lations among the previously defined variables

• Events: describes the output to be produced for
every matching

Variables (see the Kybot section variables in fig-
ure 2) describe the term variables used by the Kybot.
They have been designed with the aim of being flex-
ible enough to deal with many different information
associated with the KAF terms including semantic
and ontological statements.

Relations (see the Kybot section relations in fig-
ure 2) define the sequence of variables the Kybot
is looking for. For example, in the Kybot in fig-
ure 2, the variable named Phosphorylation
is the main pivot, the variable Of must follow
Phosphorylation (immediate is true indi-
cating that it must be the next term in the sequence),
and a variable representing a Proteinmust follow
Of. Proteins and genes are identified with the PRT
tag.

Events (expressions marked as events in figure 2)
describes the output template of the Kybot. For ev-
ery matched pattern, the kybot produces a new event
filling the template structure with the selected pieces
of information. For example, the Kybot in figure 2
selects some features of the event represented with
the variable called Phosphorylation: its term-
identification (@tid), its lemma, part of speech and
offset. The expression also describes that the vari-
able Protein plays the role of being the “Theme”
of the event. The output obtained when aplying the
Kybot in figure 2 is shown in figure 3. Comparing
the examples in table 1 and in figure 3 we observe
that all the features needed for generating the files
for describing the results are also produced by the
Kybot.

Results

We developed a set of basic auxiliary pro-
grams to extract event patterns from the train-
ing corpus. These programs obtain the struc-

ture of the events, their associated trigger words
and their frequency. For example, in the
training corpus, a pattern of the type Event
of Protein appears 35 times, where the
Event is further described as phosporylation,
phosphorylated.... Taking the most fre-
quently occurring patterns in the training data into
account, we manually developed the set of Kybots
used to extract the events from the development and
test corpora. For example, in this way we wrote the
Kybot in figure 2 that fulfils the conditions of the
pattern of interest.

The two phases mentioned in section 2, corre-
sponding to the generation of the KAF documents
and the application of Kybots, have different input
files depending on the type of event we want to
detect: simple or complex events. When extract-
ing simple events (see figure 4), we used the in-
put text and the files containing protein annotations
(“.a1” files in the task) to generate the KAF docu-
ments. These KAF documents and Kybots for sim-
ple events are provided to the mining module. In
the case of complex events (events that have other

events as arguments), the identifiers of the detected
simple events are added to the KAF document in the
first phase. A new set of Kybots describing complex
events and KAF (now with annotations of the simple
events) are used to obtain the final result (see figure
5).

For the evaluation, we also developed some pro-
grams for adapting the output of the Kybots (see fig-
ure 3) to the required format (see table 1).

We used the development corpus to improve the
Kybot performance. We developed 65 Kybots for
detecting simple events. Table 2 shows the number
of Kybots for each event type. Complex events rela-
tive to regulation (also including negative and posi-
tive regulations) were detected using a set of 24 Ky-
bots.

The evaluation of the task was based on the output

previously unseen texts. Table 3 shows in the Gold
column the number of instances for each event-type
in the test corpus. R, P and F-score columns stand
for the recall, precision and f-score the system ob-
tained for each type of event. As a consequence of
the characteristics of our system, precision is primed
over recall. For example, the system obtains 95%
and 97% precision on Phosphorylation an Localiza-
tion events, respectively, although its recall is con-
siderably lower (41% and 19%).

4 Conclusions and Future work

This work presents the first results of the applica-
tion of the KYOTO text mining system for extracting
events when ported to the biomedical domain. The
KYOTO technology and data formats have shown to
be flexible enough to be easily adapted to a new task
and domain. Although the results are far from satis-
factory, we must take into account the limited effort
we dedicated to adapting the system and designing
the kybots, which can be roughly estimated in two

person/months.

After the final evaluation, our system obtained the
thirteenth position out of 15 participating systems
in the main task (processing PubMed abstracts and
full paper articles), obtaining 19.07%, 42.08% and
26.25 recall, precision an f-score, respectively, far
from the best competing system (49.41%, 64.75%
and 56.04%). Although they are far from satisfac-
tory, we must take into account the limited time we
dedicated to adapting the system and designing the
kybots. Apart from that, due to time restrictions,
our system did not make use of the ample set of
resources available, such as named entities, corefer-
ence resolution or syntactic parsing of the sentences.
On the other hand, the system, based on manually
developed rules, obtains reasonable accuracy in the
task of processing full paper articles, obtaining 45%
precision and 21% recall, compared to 59% and 47%
for the best system, which means that the rule-based
approach performs more robustly when dealing with
long texts (5 full texts correspond to approximately
150 abstracts). As we have said before, our main
objective was to evaluate the capabilities of the KY-
OTO technology without adding any additional in-
formation. The use of more linguistic information
will probably facilitate our work and will benefit the
system results. In the near future we will study the
application of machine learning techniques for the
automatic generation of Kybots from the training
data. We also plan to include additional linguistic
and semantic processing in the event extraction pro-
cess to exploit the current semantic and ontological
capabilities of the KYOTO technology.
