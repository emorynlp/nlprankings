Abstract

We consider entity-level sentiment anal-
ysis in Arabic, a morphologically rich
language with increasing resources. We
present a system that is applied to com-
plex posts written in response to Ara-
bic newspaper articles. Our goal is to
identify important entity “targets” within
the post along with the polarity expressed
about each target. We achieve signif-
icant improvements over multiple base-
lines, demonstrating that the use of spe-
cific morphological representations im-
proves the performance of identifying both
important targets and their sentiment, and
that the use of distributional semantic clus-
ters further boosts performances for these
representations, especially when richer
linguistic resources are not available.

1 Introduction

Target-specific sentiment analysis has recently be-
come a popular problem in natural language pro-
cessing. In interpreting social media posts, anal-
ysis needs to include more than just whether peo-
ple feel positively or negatively; it also needs to
include what they like or dislike. The task of
finding all targets within the data has been called
“open-domain targeted sentiment” (Mitchell et
al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). If we could suc-
cessfully identify the targets of sentiment, it would
be valuable for a number of applications includ-
ing sentiment summarization, question answering,
understanding public opinion during political con-
flict, or assessing needs of populations during nat-
ural disasters.

In this paper, we address the open-domain tar-
geted sentiment task. Input to our system con-
sists of online posts, which can be comprised of
one or multiple sentences, contain multiple enti-
ties with different sentiment, and have different

Figure 1: Online post with annotated target enti-
ties and sentiment (green:pos, yellow:neg).

domains. Our goal is to identify the important
entities towards which opinions are expressed in
the post; these can include any nominal or noun
phrase, including events, or concepts, and they
are not restricted to named entities as has been
the case in some previous work. The only con-
straint is that the entities need to be explicitly men-
tioned in the text. Our work also differs from much
work on targeted sentiment analysis in that posts
are long, complex, with many annotated targets
and a lack of punctuation that is characteristic of
Arabic online language. Figure 1 shows an ex-
ample post, where targets are either labeled posi-
tive (green) if a positive opinion is expressed about
them and negative (yellow) if a negative opinion is
expressed.

To identify targets and sentiment, we develop
two sequence labeling models, a target-specific
model and a sentiment-specific model. Our mod-
els try to learn syntactic relations between enti-
ties and opinion words, but they also make use
of (1) Arabic morphology and (2) entity seman-
tics. Our use of morphology allows us to capture
all “words” that play a role in identification of the
target, while our use of entity semantics allows us
to group together similar entities which may all be
targets of the same sentiment; for example, if a
commenter expresses negative sentiment towards

the United States, they may also express negative
sentiment towards America or Obama.

Our results show that morphology matters when
identifying entity targets and the sentiment ex-
pressed towards them. We find for instance that
the attaching Arabic definite article Al+ È@ is an
important indicator of the presence of a target en-
tity and splitting it off boosts recall of targets,
while sentiment models perform better when less
tokens are split. We also conduct a detailed anal-
ysis of errors revealing that the task generally en-
tails hard problems such as a considerable amount
of implicit sentiment and the presence of multiple
targets with varying importance.

In what follows, we describe related work (§ 2),
data and models (§ 3 and § 4), and linguistic deci-
sions made for Arabic (§ 5). In § 6, we describe
our use of word vector clusters learned on a large
Arabic corpus. Finally, § 7 presents experiments
and detailed error analysis.

2 Related Work

Aspect-based and Entity-specific Analysis
Early work in target-based sentiment looked at
identifying aspects in a restricted domain: product
or customer reviews. Many of these systems used
unsupervised and topical methods for determining
aspects of products; Hu and Liu (2004) used fre-
quent feature mining to find noun phrase aspects,
Brody and Elhadad (2010) used topic modeling
to find important keywords in restaurant reviews,
and Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) mined the
web to find important aspects associated with
debate topics and their corresponding polarities.
SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Pontiki et al., 2014) ran
several subtasks for identifying aspect terms and
sentiment towards aspects and terms in restaurant
and laptop reviews.

Entity-specific sentiment analysis has been fre-
quently studied in social media and online posts.
Jiang et al. (2011) proposed identifying sentiment
of a tweet towards a specific named entity, tak-
ing into account multiple mentions of the given
entity. Biyani et al. (2015) studied sentiment to-
wards entities in online posts, where the local part
of the post that contained the entity or mentions of
it was identified and the sentiment was classified
using a number of linguistic features. The entities
were selected beforehand and consisted of known,
named entities. More recent work uses LSTM and
RNN networks to determine sentiment toward as-
pects in product reviews (Wang et al., 2016) and

towards entities in Twitter (Dong et al., 2014; Tang
et al., 2015). SemEval 2016 ran two tasks on senti-
ment analysis (Nakov et al., 2016) and stance (Mo-
hammad et al., 2016) towards pre-defined topics in
Twitter, both on English data.

Open domain targeted analysis In early work.
Kim and Hovy (2006) proposed finding opinion
target and sources in news text by automatic label-
ing of semantic roles. Here, opinion-target rela-
tionships were restricted to relations that can be
captured using semantic roles. Ruppenhofer et
al. (2008) discussed the challenges of identifying
targets in open-domain text which cannot be ad-
dressed by semantic role labeling, such as implic-
itly conveyed sentiment, global and local targets
related to the same entity, and the need for distin-
guishing between entity and proposition targets.

Sequence labeling models became more popu-
lar for this problem: Mitchell et al. (2013) used
CRF model combinations to identify named en-
tity targets in English and Spanish, and Yang and
Cardie (2013) used joint modeling to predict opin-
ion expressions and their source and target spans
in news articles, improving over several single
CRF models. Their focus was on identifying di-
rectly subjective opinion expressions (e.g "I hate
[this dictator]" vs. "[This dictator] is destroy-
ing his country.") Recent work (Deng and Wiebe,
2015) identifies entity sources and targets, as well
as the sentiment expressed by and towards these
entities. This work was based on probablistic soft
logic models, also with a focus on direct subjective
expressions.

There is also complementary work on using
neural networks for tagging open-domain targets
(Zhang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015) in shorter
posts. Previous work listed did not consider word
morphology, or explicitly model distributional en-
tity semantics as indicative of the presence of sen-
timent targets.

Related work in Arabic Past work in Arabic
machine translation (Habash and Sadat, 2006) and
named entity recognition (Benajiba et al., 2008)
considered the tokenization of complex Arabic
words as we do in our sequence labeling task.
Analysis of such segmentation schemes has not
been reported for Arabic sentiment tasks, which
cover mostly sentence-level sentiment analysis
and where the lemma or surface bag-of-word rep-
resentations have typically been sufficient.

There are now many studies on sentence-level

1003



sentiment analysis in Arabic news and social me-
dia (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2011; Mourad and
Darwish, 2013; Refaee and Rieser, 2014; Salameh
et al., 2015). Elarnaoty et al. (2012) proposed
identifying sources of opinions in Arabic using a
CRF with a number of patterns, lexical and sub-
jectivity clues; they did not discuss morphology
or syntactic relations. Al-Smadi et al. (2015) de-
veloped a dataset and built a majority baseline for
finding targets in Arabic book reviews of known
aspects; Obaidat et al. (2015) also developed a
lexicon-based approach to improve on this base-
line. Abu-Jbara et al. (2013) created a simple
opinion-target system for Arabic by identifying
noun phrases in polarized text; this was done in-
trinsically as part of an effort to identify opinion
subgroups in online discussions. There are no
other sentiment target studies in Arabic that we
know of. In our experiments, we compare to meth-
ods similar to these baseline systems, as well as to
results of English work that is comparable to ours.

Entity Clusters It has been shown consistently
that semantic word clusters improve the perfor-
mance of named entity recognition (Täckström et
al., 2012; Zirikly and Hagiwara, 2015; Turian
et al., 2010) and semantic parsing (Saleh et al.,
2014); we are not aware of such work for iden-
tifying entity targets of sentiment.

3 Data

We use the Arabic Opinion Target dataset devel-
oped by Farra et al. (2015), which is publicly avail-
able1. The data consists of 1177 online comments
posted in response to Aljazeera Arabic newspaper
articles and is part of the Qatar Arabic Language
Bank (QALB) corpus (Habash et al., 2013; Za-
ghouani et al., 2014). The comments are 1-3 sen-
tences long with an average length of 51 words.
They were selected such that they included topics
from three domains: politics, culture, and sports.

Targets are always noun phrases and they are
either labeled positive if a positive opinion is ex-
pressed about them and negative if a negative
opinion is expressed (as shown in Figure 1). Tar-
gets were identified using an incremental process
where first important entities were identified, and
then entities agreed to be neutral were discarded
(the annotation does not distinguish between neu-
tral and subjective neutral).

The data also contains ambiguous or ‘undeter-

mined’ targets where annotators did agree they
were targets, but did not agree on the polarity. We
use these targets for training our target model, but
discard them when training our sentiment polarity
model. There are 4886 targets distributed as fol-
lows: 38.2% positive, 50.5% negative, and 11.3%
ambiguous. We divide the dataset into a training
set (80%), development set (10%), and blind test
set (10%), all of which represent the three differ-
ent domains. We make the splits available for re-
searchers to run comparative experiments.

4 Sequence Labeling Models

For modeling the data, we choose Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) for
the ability to engineer Arabic linguistic features
and because of the success of CRF models in the
past for entity identification and classification re-
lated tasks.

We build two linear chain CRF models:

1. Target Model This model predicts a se-
quence of labels ~E for a sequence of input
tokens ~x, where

Ei ∈ {T (target), O(not_target)}

and each token xi is represented by a feature
vector ~fit. A token is labeled T if it is part
of a target; a target can contain one or more
consecutive tokens.

2. Sentiment Model This model predicts a se-
quence of labels ~S for the sequence ~x,

Si ∈ {P (pos), N(neg), ∅(neutral)}

and each token xi is represented by a feature
vector:

( ~fis, Ei); Ei ∈ {T, O}

Additionally, this model has the constraint:

ifEi = T, Si ∈ {P,N}

and otherwise
Si = ∅

1004



The last constraint indicating that sentiment is
either positive or negative is ensured by the train-
ing data, where we have no examples of target to-
kens having neutral sentiment. The two models
are trained independently. Thus, if target words
are already available for the data, the sentiment
model can be run without training or running the
target model. Otherwise, the sentiment model
can be run on the output of the target predictor.
The sentiment model uses knowledge of whether
a word is a target and utilizes context from neigh-
boring words whereby the entire sequence is opti-
mized to predict sentiment polarities for the tar-
gets. An example sequence is shown in Table
1, where the dictator is an entity target towards
which the writer implicitly expresses negative sen-
timent.

5 Arabic Morphology and Linguistics

5.1 Arabic Morphology
In Arabic, clitics and affixes can attach to the be-
ginning and end of the word stem, making words
complex. For example, in the sentence AëñÊJ. �®�JA 	̄
‘So they welcomed her’, the discourse conjuction
(so +

	¬), the opinion target (her Aë+), opinion
holder (they ð@+), and the opinion expression itself
(welcomed ÉJ. �®�J@) are all collapsed in the same
word.

Clitics, such as conjunctions +ð w+, preposi-
tions +H. b+, the definite article È@+ Al+ ‘the’
(all of which attach at the beginning), and posses-
sive pronouns and object pronouns è+ +h Aë+ +hA
‘his/her’ or ‘him/her’ (which attach at the end) can
all function as individual words. Thus, they can be
represented as separate tokens in the CRF.

The morphological analyzer MADAMIRA
(Pasha et al., 2014) enables the tokenization of a
word using multiple schemes. We consider the fol-
lowing two schemes:

• D3: the Declitization scheme which splits
off conjunction clitics, particles and prepo-
sitions, Al+, and all the enclitics at the end.

• ATB: the Penn Arabic Treebank tokeniza-
tion, which separates all clitics above except
the definite article Al+, which it keeps at-
tached.

For a detailed description of Arabic concatenative
morphology and tokenization schemes, the reader
is referred to Habash (2010).

For each token, we add a part of speech feature.
For word form (non-clitic) tokens, we use the part
of speech (POS) feature produced by the morpho-
logical analyzer. We consider the surface word
and the lemma for representing the word form.
For the clitics that were split off, we use a de-
tailed POS feature that is also extracted from the
output of the analyzer and can take such forms as
DET for Al+ or poss_pron_3MP for third person
masculine possessive pronouns. Table 2 shows the
words and part of speech for the input sentence
AëñÊJ. �®�JA 	̄ ‘so they welcomed her’ fa-istaqbalu-ha,
using the lemma representation for the word form
and the D3 tokenization scheme.

These lexical and POS features are added to
both our target model and sentiment model.

5.2 Sentiment Features
The choice of sentiment lexicon is an impor-
tant consideration when developing systems for
new and/or low-resource languages. We con-
sider three lexicons: (1) SIFAAT, a manually con-
structed Arabic lexicon of 3982 adjectives (Abdul-
Mageed and Diab, 2011), (2) ArSenL, an Arabic
lexicon developed by linking English SentiWord-
Net with Arabic WordNet and an Arabic lexical
database (Badaro et al., 2014), and (3) the En-
glish MPQA lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), where
we look up words by matching on the English
glosses produced by the morphological analyzer
MADAMIRA.

For the target model, we add token-level binary
features representing subjectivity, and for the sen-
timent model, we add both subjectivity and polar-
ity features.

We also add a feature specifying respectively
the subjectivity or polarity of the parent word of
the token in the dependency tree in the target or
sentiment model.

5.3 Syntactic Dependencies
We ran the CATiB (Columbia Arabic Treebank)
dependency parser (Shahrour et al., 2015) on
our data. CATiB uses a number of intuitive la-
bels specifying the token’s syntactic role: e.g
SBJ, OBJ, MOD, and IDF for the Arabic idafa
construct (e.g �éÓñºmÌ'@ �
KP president of govern-
ment), as well as its part of speech role. In
addition to the sentiment dependency features
specifying the sentiment of parent words, we
added dependency features specifying the syn-
tactic role of the token in relation to its par-
ent, and the path from the token to the parent,

e.g nom_obj_vrb or nom_idf_nom, as well as the
sentiment path from the token to the parent, e.g
nom(neutral)_obj_vrb(negative) .

5.4 Chunking and Named Entities

The morphological analyzer MADAMIRA also
produces base phrase chunks (BPC) and named
entity tags (NER) for each token. We add fea-
tures for these as well, based on the hypothe-
sis that they will help define the spans for entity
targets, whether they are named entities or any
noun phrases. We refer to the sentiment and tar-
get models that utilize Arabic morphology, sen-
timent, syntactic relations and entity chunks as
best-linguistic.

6 Word Clusters and Entity Semantics

Similar entities which occur in the context of the
same topic or the same larger entity are likely to
occur as targets alongside each other and to have
similar sentiment expressed towards them. They
may repeat frequently in a post even if they do
not explicitly or lexically refer to the same per-
son or object. For example, someone writing
about American foreign policy may frequently re-
fer to entities such as {the United States, America,
Obama, the Americans, Westerners}. Such entities
can cluster together semantically and it is likely
that a person expressing positive or negative sen-
timent towards one of these entities may also ex-
press the same sentiment towards the other entities
in this set.

Moreover, cluster features serve as a denser fea-
ture representation with a reduced feature space
compared to Arabic lexical features. Such fea-
tures can benefit the CRF where a limited amount
of training data is available for target entities.

To utilize the semantics of word clusters, we
build word embedding vectors using the skip-gram
method (Mikolov et al., 2013) and cluster them
using the K-Means algorithm (MacQueen, 1967),
with Euclidean distance as a metric. Euclidean
distance serves as a semantic similarity metric and

has been commonly used as a distance-based mea-
sure for clustering word vectors.

The vectors are built on Arabic Wikipedia 2 on
a corpus of 137M words resulting in a vocabulary
of 254K words. We preprocess the corpus by tok-
enizing (using the schemes described in section 5)
and lemmatizing before building the word vectors.
We vary the number of clusters and use the clus-
ters as binary features in our target and sentiment
models.

7 Experiments and Results

7.1 Experiments
Setup To build our sentiment and target models,
we use CRF++ (Kudo, 2005) to build linear-chain
sequences. We use a context window of +/-2 for all
features except the syntactic dependencies, where
we use a window of +/-4 to better capture syntactic
relations in the posts. For the sentiment model,
we include the context of the previous predicted
label, to avoid predicting consecutive tokens with
opposite polarity.

We evaluate all our experiments on the devel-
opment set which contains 116 posts and 442 tar-
gets, and present a final result with the best mod-
els on the unseen test. For the SentiWordNet-
based lexicon ArSenL, we tune for the sentiment
score threshold and use t=0.2. We use Google’s
word2vec tool3 for building and clustering word
vectors with dimension 200. We vary the number
of clusters k between 10 (25K words/cluster) and
20K (12 words/cluster).

Baselines For evaluating the predicted targets,
we follow work in English (Deng and Wiebe,
2015) and use the all-NP baseline, where all nouns
and noun phrases in the post are predicted as im-
portant targets.

For evaluating sentiment towards targets, we
consider four baselines: the majority baseline
which always predicts negative, and the lexicon

baseline evaluated in the case of each of our three
lexicons: manually created, WordNet-based, and
English-translated. The strong lexicon baseline
splits the post into sentences or phrases by punctu-
ation, finds the phrase that contains the predicted
target, and returns positive if there are more posi-
tive words than negative words, and negative oth-
erwise. These baselines are similar to the methods
of previously published work for Arabic targeted
sentiment (Al-Smadi et al., 2015; Obaidat et al.,
2015; Abu-Jbara et al., 2013).

We run our pipelined models for all morpho-
logical representation schemes: surface word (no
token splits), lemma (no clitics), lemma with ATB
clitics (contain all token splits except Al+), and
lemma with D3 clitics (contains all token splits).
We explore the effect of semantic word clusters
in these scenarios. Finally we show our best-
linguistic (high-resource) model, and the resulting
integration with word clusters.

7.2 Results

Tables 3-5 show the results. Target F-measure is
calculated using the subset metric (similar to met-
rics used by Yang and Cardie (2013), Irsoy and
Cardie (2014)); if either the predicted or gold tar-
get tokens are a subset of the other, the match
is counted when computing F-measure. Overlap-
ping matches that are not subsets do not count (e.g
QåÓ 	­�̄ñÓ Egypt’s position and ÉJ
K @Qå @ 	­�̄ñÓ Is-
rael’s position do not match.). For this task, in
the case of multiple mentions of the same entity
in the post, any mention will be considered correct
if the subset matches4 (e.g if 	á�
¢Ê 	̄ Palestine is
a gold target, and 	á�
¢Ê 	̄ �éËðX state of Palestine
is predicted at a different position in the post, it
is still correct). This evaluation is driven from the
sentiment summarization perspective: we want to
predict the overall opinion in the post towards an
entity.

F-pos, F-neg, and Acc-sent show the perfor-
mance of the sentiment model on only the cor-
rectly predicted targets5. Since the target and sen-
timent models are trained separately, this is meant
to give an idea of how the sentiment model would
perform in standalone mode, if targets were al-
ready provided.

F-all shows the overall F-measure showing the

overlap; the difference in target F-measure is 2 points and
consistent across the different systems.

larity was not agreed on by the annotators.

performance of correctly predicted targets with
correct sentiment compared to the total number of
polar targets. This evaluates the end-to-end sce-
nario of both important target and sentiment pre-
diction.

Best results are shown in bold. Significance
thresholds are calculated for the best performing
systems (Tables 4-5) using the approximate ran-
domization test (Yeh, 2000) for target recall, preci-
sion, F-measure, Acc-sent and F-all. Significance
over the method in the previous row is indicated
by * (p < 0.05),** (p < 0.005),** (p < 0.0005).
A confidence interval of almost four F-measure
points is required to obtain p < 0.05. Our dataset
is small; nonetheless we get significant results.

Comparing Sentiment Lexicons Table 3 shows
the results comparing the different baselines. All
targets are retrieved using all-NP; sentiment is de-
termined using the lexical baselines. As expected,
the all-NP baseline shows near perfect recall and
low precision in predicting important targets. We
observe that the gloss-translated MPQA lexicon
outperforms the two other Arabic lexicons among
the sentiment baselines.

We believe that the hit rate of MPQA is
higher than that of the smaller, manually-labeled
SIFAAT, and it is more precise than the automat-
ically generated WordNet-based lexicon ArSenL.
The performance of MPQA is, however, reliant
on the availability of high-quality English glosses.
We found MPQA to consistently outperform in the
model results, so in our best-linguistic models, we
only show results using the MPQA lexicon.

Comparing Morphology Representations
Looking at table 4, we can see that using the
lemma representation easily outperforms the
sparser surface word, and that adding tokenized
clitics as separate tokens outperforms representa-
tions which only use the word form. Moreover,
upon using the D3 decliticization method, we
observe a significant increase in recall of targets
over the ATB representation. This shows that the
presence of the Arabic definite article È@ Al+ is an
important indicator of a target entity; thus, even if
an entity is not named, Al+ indicates that it is a
known entity and is likely more salient.

The more tokens are split off, the more targets
are recalled, although this comes at the cost of
a decrease in sentiment performance, where the
lemma representation has the highest sentiment
score and the D3 representation has the lowest af-

tokens in the sequence (which are function words
and have not much bearing on semantics) gener-
ates noise with respect to the sentiment model. All
models significantly improve the baselines on F-
measure; for Acc-sent, the surface word CRF does
not significantly outperform the MPQA baseline.

Effect of Word Clusters Figures 2 - 5 show the
performance of different morphological represen-
tations when varying the number of word vector
clusters k. (Higher k means more clusters and
fewer entities per semantic cluster.) Adding clus-
ter features tends to further boost the recall of
important targets for all morphological schemes,
while more or less maintaining precision. The dif-
ference in different schemes is consistent with the
results of Table 4; the D3 representation maintains
the highest recall of targets, while the opposite is
true for identifying sentiment towards the targets.
The ATB representation shows the best overall F-
measure, peaking at 41.5 using k=250 (compare
with 38.2 using no clusters); however, it recalls
much fewer targets than the D3 representation.

The effect of clusters on sentiment is less clear;
it seems to benefit the D3 and ATB schemes more
than lemma (significant boosts in sentiment accu-
racy). The improvements in F-measure and F-all
observed by using the best value of k is statisti-
cally significant for all schemes (k=10 for lemma,
k=250 for lemma+ATB, k=500 for lemma+D3,
with F-all values of 40.7, 41.5, and 39.1 respec-
tively). In general, the cluster performances tend
to peak at a certain value of k which balances the

reduced sparsity of the model (fewer clusters) with
the semantic closeness of entities within a cluster
(more clusters).

Performance of Best Linguistic Model Table

model, which in addition to the word form and
part of speech, contains named entity and base
phrase chunks, the syntactic dependency features,
and the sentiment lexicon features. The best lin-
guistic model is run using both ATB and D3 to-
kenization schemes, and then using a combined
ATB+D3 scheme where we use D3 for the target
model and remove the extra clitics before piping in
the output to the sentiment model. This combined

scheme results in the best results overall: F-score
of 61.4 for targets, accuracy of 75.4 for sentiment
and overall F-measure of 43.1.

Adding the richer linguistic resources results in
both improved target precision, recall, and senti-
ment scores, with F-measure for positive targets
reaching 67.7 for positive targets and 80 for nega-
tive targets. Performance exceeds that of the sim-
pler models which use only POS and word clus-
ters, but it is worth noting that using only the ba-
sic model with the word clusters can achieve sig-
nificant boosts in recall and F-measure bringing it
closer to the rich linguistic model.

The last row shows the best linguistic model
D3+ATB combined with the clusters (best re-
sult for k=8000, or about 30 words per clus-
ter). Adding the clusters improves target and F-
measure scores, although this result is not statisti-
cally significant. We observe that it becomes more
difficult to improve on the rich linguistic model
using word clusters, which are more beneficial for
low resource scenarios.

Our results are comparable to published work
for most similar tasks in English: e.g Yang
and Cardie (2013) who reported target subset F-
measure of ~65, Pontiki et al. (2014) where best

7.3 Error Analysis
We analyzed the output of our best linguistic mod-
els on the development set, and observed the fol-
lowing kind of errors:

Implicit Sentiment This was the most common
kind of error observed. Commenters frequently
expressed complex subjective language without
using sentiment words, often resorting to sarcasm,
metaphor, and argumentative language. We also
observed persistent errors where positive senti-
ment was identified towards an entity because of
misleading polar words; e.g minds Èñ�®ªË@ was
consistently predicted to be positive even though
the post in question was using implicit language
to express negative sentiment; the English gloss

Example 1
Till when will [the world]- wait before it intervenes against these [crimes against humanity]- committed by this [criminal bloody
regime]- which will not stop doing that... because its presence has always been associated with oppression and murder and crime...
But now it’s time for it to disappear and descend into [the trash of history]-.

Output the world:neg crimes:neg criminal bloody regime:neg the trash of history:neg
Example 2
[Malaysia]+ is considered the most successful country in Eastern Asia, and its economic success has spread to other [aspects of life
in Malaysia]+, for its [services to its citizens]+ have improved, and there has been an increase in [the quality of its health and
educational and social and financial and touristic services]+, which has made it excellent for foreign investments.

Output Malaysia:pos health:pos educational and social:neg financial:neg

is brains, which appears as a positive subjective
word in the MPQA lexicon. The posts also con-
tained cases of complex coreference where sub-
jective statements were at long distances from the
targets they discussed.

Annotation Errors Our models often correctly
predicted targets with reasonable sentiment which
were not marked as important targets by annota-
tors; this points to the subjective nature of the task.

Sentiment lexicon misses These errors resulted
from mis-match between the sentiment of the En-
glish gloss and the intended Arabic meaning, lead-
ing to polar sentiment being missed.

Primary Targets The data contains multiple en-
tity targets and not all are of equal importance. Out
of the first 50 posts manually analyzed on the dev
set, we found that in 38 out of 50 cases (76%) the
correct primary targets were identified (the most
important topical sentiment target(s) addressed by
the post); in 4 cases, a target was predicted where
the annotations contained no polar targets at all,
and in the remaining cases the primary target was
missed. Correct sentiment polarity was predicted
for 31 out of the 38 correct targets (81.6%).

In general, our analysis showed that our system
does well on posts where targets and subjective
language are well formed, but that the important
target identification task is difficult and made more
complex by the long and repetitive nature of the
posts. Table 7 shows two examples of the trans-
lated output of SMARTies, the first on more well-
formed text and the second on text that is more
difficult to parse.

8 Conclusions

We presented a linguistically inspired system that
can recognize important entity targets along with
sentiment in opinionated posts in Arabic. The tar-
gets can be any type of entity or event, and they are

not known beforehand. Both target and sentiment
results significantly improve multiple lexical base-
lines and are comparable to previously published
results in similar tasks for English, a similarly hard
task. Our task is further complicated by the infor-
mal and very long sentences that are used in Ara-
bic online posts. We showed that the choice of
morphological representation significantly affects
the performance of the target and sentiment mod-
els. This could shed light on further research in
target-specific sentiment analysis for morphologi-
cally complex languages, an area little investigated
previously. We also showed that the use of se-
mantic clusters boosts performance for both target
and sentiment identification. Furthermore, seman-
tic clusters alone can achieve performance close
to a more resource-rich linguistic model relying
on syntax and sentiment lexicons, and would thus
be a good approach for low-resource languages.
Integrating different morphological preprocessing
schemes along with clusters gives our best result.

Our code and data is publicly available6. Fu-
ture work will consider cross-lingual clusters and
morphologically different languages.
