Abstract
In this paper, we describe the system sub-
mitted by the team TUD to Task 8 at
SemEval 2010. The challenge focused on
the identification of semantic relations be-
tween pairs of nominals in sentences col-
lected from the web. We applied max-
imum entropy classification using both
lexical and syntactic features to describe
the nominals and their context. In addi-
tion, we experimented with features de-
scribing the semantic relatedness (SR) be-
tween the target nominals and a set of clue
words characteristic to the relations. Our
best submission with SR features achieved
69.23% macro-averaged F-measure, pro-
viding 8.73% improvement over our base-
line system. Thus, we think SR can serve
as a natural way to incorporate external
knowledge to relation classification.

1 Introduction

Automatic extraction of typed semantic relations
between sentence constituents is an important step
towards deep semantic analysis and understand-
ing the semantic content of natural language texts.
Identification of relations between a nominal and
the main verb, and between pairs of nominals are
important steps for the extraction of structured se-
mantic information from text, and can benefit vari-
ous applications ranging from Information Extrac-
tion and Information Retrieval to Machine Trans-
lation or Question Answering.

The Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Re-
lations Between Pairs of Nominals challenge
(Hendrickx et al., 2010) focused on the identi-
fication of specific relation types between nomi-
nals (nouns or base noun phrases) in natural lan-
guage sentences collected from the web. The main

gence of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences

task of the challenge was to identify and clas-
sify instances of 9 abstract semantic relations be-
tween noun phrases, i.e. Cause-Effect, Instrument-
Agency, Product-Producer, Content-Container,
Entity-Origin, Entity-Destination, Component-
Whole, Member-Collection, Message-Topic. That
is, given two nominals (e1 and e2) in a sentence,
systems had to decide whether relation(e1,e2), re-
lation(e2,e1) holds for one of the relation types or
the nominals’ relation is other (falls to a category
not listed above or they are unrelated). In this
sense, the challenge was an important pilot task
towards large scale semantic processing of text.

In this paper, we describe the system we sub-
mitted to Semeval 2010, Task 8. We applied max-
imum entropy classification to the problem using
both lexical and contextual features to describe
the nominals themselves and their context (i.e.
the sentence). In addition, we experimented with
features exploiting the strength of association be-
tween the target nominals and a predefined set of
clue words characteristic to the nine relation types.
In order to measure the semantic relatedness (SR)
of targets and clues, we used the Explicit Seman-
tic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007)
SR measure (based on Wikipedia, Wiktionary and
WordNet). Our best submission, benefiting from
SR features, achieved 69.23% macro-averaged F-
measure for the 9 relation types used. Providing
8.73% improvement over our baseline system, we
found the SR-based features to be beneficial for
the classification of semantic relations.

2 Experimental setup

2.1 Feature set and selection

Feature set In our system, we used both lexical
(1-3) and contextual features (4-8) to describe the
nominals and their context (i.e. the sentence). Ad-
ditionally, we experimented with a set of features
(9) that exploit the co-occurrence statistics of the

210



nominals and a set of clue words chosen manu-
ally, examining the relation definitions and exam-
ples provided by the organizers. The clues char-
acterize the relations addressed in the task (e.g.
cargo, goods, content, box, bottle characterize the
Content-Container relation)1. Each feature type
was distinguished from the others using a prefix.
All but the semantic relatedness features we used
were binary, denoting whether a specific word,
lemma, POS tag, etc. is found in the example sen-
tence, or not. SR features were real valued, scaled
to [0, 1] for each clue word separately (on train,
and the same scaling factores were applied on the
test data). The feature types used:
1. Token: word unigrams in the sentence in their
inflected form. 2. Lemma: word uni- and bigrams
in the sentence in their lemmatized form. 3. Tar-
get Nouns: the syntactic head words of the target
nouns. 4. POS: the part of speech uni- and bi-
and trigrams in the sentence. 5. Between POS: the
part of speech sequence between the target nouns.
6. Dependency Path: the dependency path (syn-
tactic relations and directions) between the target
nouns. The whole path constituted a single fea-
ture. 7. Target Distance: the distance between
the target nouns (in tokens). 8. Sentence Length:
the length of the sentence (in tokens). 9. Seman-
tic Relatedness: the semantic relatedness scores
measuring the strength of association between the
target nominals and the set of clue words we col-
lected. In order to measure the semantic related-
ness (SR) of targets and clues, we used the Explicit
Semantic Analysis (ESA) SR measure.
Feature selection In order to discard uninforma-
tive features automatically, we performed feature
selection on the binary features. We kept features
that satisfied the following three conditions:

freq(x) > 3 (1)
p = argmaxyP (y|x) > t1 (2)

p5 × freq(x) > t2 (3)

where freq(x) denotes the frequency of feature x
observed in the training dataset, y denotes a class
label, p denotes the highest posterior probability
(for feature x) over the nine relations (undirected)
and the other class. Finally, t1, t2 are filtering
thresholds chosen arbitrarily. We used t1 = 0.25
for all features but the dependency path, where we

used t1 = 0.2. We set the thresold t2 to 1.9 for
lexical features (i.e. token and lemma features),
to 0.3 for dependency path features and to 0.9 for
all other features. All parameters for the feature
selection process were chosen manually (cross-
validating the parameters was omitted due to lack
of time during the challenge development period).
The higher t2 value for lexical features was moti-
vated by the aim to avoid overfitting, and the lower
thresholds for dependency-based features by the
hypothesis that these can be most efficient to deter-
mine the direction of relationships (c.f. we disre-
garded direction during feature selection). As the
numeric SR features were all bound to clue words
selected specifically for the task, we did not per-
form any feature selection for that feature type.

2.2 Learning models
We compared three learning algorithms, using
the baseline feature types (1-8), namely a C4.5
decision tree learner, a support vector classifier
(SMO), and a maximum entropy (logistic regres-
sion) classifier, all implemented in the Weka pack-
age (Hall et al., 2009). We trained the SMO model
with polynomial kernel of degree 2, fitting logistic
models to the output to get valid probability esti-
mates and the C4.5 model with pruning confidence
factor set to 0.33. All other parameters were set to
their default values as defined in Weka. We found
the maxent model to perform best in 10-fold cross
validation on the training set (see Table 1). Thus,
we used maxent in our submissions.

We submitted 4 runs to the challenge. Table

Baseline (Base) As our baseline system, we used
the information extracted from the sentence itself
(i.e. lexical and contextual features, types 1-8).
Wikipedia (WP) As a first extension, we added
SR features (9) exploiting term co-occurrence in-
formation, using the ESA model with Wikipedia.
Combined Semantic Relatedness (cSR) Second,
we replaced the ESA measure with a combined
measure developed by us, exploiting term co-
occurrence not only in Wikipedia, but also in
WordNet and Wiktionary glosses. We found this
measure to perform better than the Wikipedia-
based ESA in earlier experiments.
cSR threshold (cSR-t) We submitted the predic-
tions of the cSR system, with less emphasis on the
other class: we predicted other label only when
the following held for the posteriors predicted by
cSR: argmaxyP (y|x)p(other) < 0.7. The threshold 0.7 was
chosen based on the training dataset.

First, the SR features improved the performance
of our system by a wide marging (see Table
2). The difference in performance is even more
prominent on the Test dataset, which suggests that
these features efficiently incorporated useful ex-
ternal evidence on the relation between the nomi-
nals and this not just improved the accuracy of the
system, but also helped to avoid overfitting. Thus
we conclude that the SR features with the encoded
external knowledge helped the maxent model to
learn a hypothesis that clearly generalized better.

Second, we notice that the combined SR mea-
sure proved to be more useful than the standard
ESA measure (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007)
improving the performance by approximately 1
percent over ESA, both in terms of macro aver-
aged F-measure and overall accuracy. This con-
firms our hypothesis that the combined measure is
more robust than ESA with just Wikipedia.

3.1 Error Analysis

Table 3 shows the breakdown of system predic-
tions to different categories, and their contribution
to the official ranking as true/false positives and
negatives. The submission that manipulated the
decision threshold for the other class improved
the overall performance by a small margin. This
fact, and Table 3 confirm that our approach had
major difficulties in correctly discriminating the 9
relation categories from other. Since this class is
an umbrella class for unrelated nominals and the
numerous semantic relations not considered in the
challenge, it proved to be extremely difficult to ac-
curately characterize this class. On the other hand,
the confusion of the 9 specified relations (between
each other) and directionality were less prominent
error types. The most frequent cross-relation
confusion types were the misclassification
of Component-Whole as Instrument-Agency
and Member-Collection; Content-Container
as Component-Whole; Instrument-Agency as
Product-Producer and vice versa. Interestingly,
Component-Whole and Cause-Effect relations
were the most typical sources for wrong direction
errors. Lowering the decision threshold for other
in our system naturally resulted in more true
positive relation classifications, but unfortunately
not only raised the number of other instances
falsely classified as being one of the valuable re-

212



lations, but also introduced several wrong relation
classification errors (see Table 3). That is why
this step resulted only in marginal improvement.

4 Conclusions & Future Work

In this paper, we presented our system submitted
to the Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Re-
lations Between Pairs of Nominals challenge at
SemEval 2010. We submitted 4 different system
runs. Our first submission was a baseline system
(Base) exploiting lexical and contextual informa-
tion collected solely from the sentence to be classi-
fied. A second run (WP) complemented this base-
line configuration with a set of features that used
Explicit Semantic Analysis (Wikipedia) to model
the SR of the nominals to be classified and a set
of clue words characteristic of the relations used
in the challenge. Our third run (cSR) used a com-
bined semantic relatedness measure that exploits
multiple lexical semantic resources (Wikipedia,
Wiktionary and WordNet) to provide more reliable
relatedness estimates. Our final run (cSR-t) ex-
ploited that our system in general was inaccurate
in predicting instances of the other class. Thus,
it used the same predictions as cSR, but favored
the prediction of one of the 9 specified classes in-
stead of other, when a comparably high posterior
for such a class was predicted by the system.

Our approach is fairly simple, in the sense that it
used mostly just local information collected from
the sentence. It is clear though that encoding as
much general world knowledge to the representa-
tion as possible is crucial for efficient classifica-
tion of semantic relations. In the light of the above
fact, the results we obtained are reasonable.

As the main goal of our study, we attempted
to use semantic relatedness features that exploit
texts in an external knowledge source (Wikipedia,
Wiktionary or WordNet in our case) to incorpo-
rate some world knowledge in the form of term co-
occurrence scores. We found that our SR features
significantly contribute to system performance.
Thus, we think this kind of information is useful
in general for relation classification. The experi-
mental results showed that our combined SR mea-
sure performed better than the standard ESA using
Wikipedia. This confirms our hypothesis that ex-
ploiting multiple resources for modeling term re-
latedness is beneficial in general.

Obviously, our system leaves much space for
improvement – the feature selection parameters

and the clue word set for the SR features were
chosen manually, without any cross-validation (on
the training set), due to lack of time. One of the
participating teams used an SVM-based system
and gained a lot from manipulating the decision
thresholds. Thus, despite our preliminary results,
it is also an interesting option to use SVMs.

In general, we think that more features are
needed to achieve significantly better performance
than we reported here. Top performing systems
in the challenge typically exploited web frequency
information (n-gram data) and manually encoded
relations from an ontology (mainly WordNet).
Thus, future work is to incorporate such features.

We demonstrated that SR features are helpful to
move away from lexicalized systems using token-
or lemma-based features. Probably the same holds
for web-based and ontology-based features exten-
sively used by top performing systems. This sug-
gests that experimenting with all these to see if
their value is complementary is an especially in-
teresting piece of future work.
