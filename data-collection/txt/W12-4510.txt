Abstract

We in this paper present the model for our
participation (BCMI) in the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task. This paper describes a pure
rule-based method, which assembles dif-
ferent filters in a proper order. Different
filters handle different situations and the
filtering strategies are designed manually.
These filters are assigned to different or-
dered tiers from general to special cases.
We participated in the Chinese and En-
glish closed tracks, scored 51.83 and 59.24
respectively.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we describes the approaches we u-
tilized for our participation in the CoNLL-2012
Shared Task. This year’s shared task targets at
modeling coreference resolution for multiple lan-
guages. Following (Lee et al., 2011), we extend-
s the methodology of deterministic coreference
model, using manually designed rules to rec-
ognize expressions with corresponding entities.
The deterministic coreference model (Raghu-

nathan et al., 2010) has shown good perfor-
mance in the shared task of CoNLL-2011. This
kind of model focuses on filtering with ordered
tiers: One filter is applied at one time, from
highest to lowest precision. However, compared
with learning approaches (Soon et al., 2001), s-
ince effective rules are quite heterogeneous in
different languages, several filtering methods
should be redesigned when different languages
are considered. We modified the original Stan-
ford English coreference system1 to adapt to the
Chinese scenario. For the English participation,
we implemented the full strategies and interface
of the semantic-based filters which are not ob-
tained from the open source toolkit.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
In Section 2, we review the related work; In Sec-
tion 3, we describe the detail of our model of
handling coreference resolution in Chinese; Ex-
periment results are reported in Section 4 and
the conclusion is presented in Section 5.

2 Related Work

Many existing works have been published on
learning relation extractors via supervised (Soon
et al., 2001) or unsupervised (Haghighi and K-
lein, 2010; Poon and Domingos, 2008) approach-
es. For involving semantics, (Rahman and Ng,
2011) proposed a coreference resolution model
with world knowledge; By using word associa-
tions, (Kobdani et al., 2011) showed its effec-
tiveness to coreference resolution. Compared

with machine learning methods, (Raghunathan
et al., 2010) proposed rule-base models which
have been witnessed good performance.

Researchers began to work on Chinese coref-
erence resolution at a comparatively late date
and most of them adopt a machine learning
approach. (Guochen and Yunfei, 2005) based
their Chinese personal pronoun coreference res-
olution system on decision trees and (Naiquan et
al., 2009) realized a Chinese coreference resolu-
tion system based on maximum entropy model.
(Weixuan et al., 2010) proposes a SVM-based
approach to anaphora resolution of noun phrases
in Chinese and achieves the F-measure of 63.3%
in the evaluation on ACE 2005. (Guozhi et al.,
2011) presented a model for personal pronouns
anaphora resolution based on corpus,which us-
ing rule pretreatment combined with maximum
entropy.

3 Model for Chinese

In general, we adapt Stanford English corefer-
ence system to Chinese by making necessary
changes. The sketch of this deterministic model
is to extract mentions and relevant information
firstly; then several manually designed rules, or
filtering sieves are applied to identify the corefer-
ence. Moreover, these sieves are utilized in a pre-
designed order, which are sorted from highest to
lowest precision. The ordered filtering sieves are
listed in Table 1.

Ordered Sieves

1. Mention Detection Sieve
2. Discourse Processing Sieve
3. Exact String Match Sieve
4. Relaxed String Match Sieve
5. Precise Constructs Sieve
6. Head Matching Sieves
7. Proper Head Word Match Sieve
8. Pronouns Sieve
9. Post-Processing Sieve

Table 1: Ordered filtering sieves for Chinese. Modi-
fied sieves are bold.

We remove the semantic-based sieves due to
the resource constraints. The simplified version
consists of nine filtering sieves. The bold ones

in Table 1 are the modified sieves for Chinese.
First of all, we adopt the head finding rules for
Chinese used in (Levy and Manning, 2003), and
this affects sieve 4, 6 and 7 which are all take
advantage of the head words. And our change
to other sieves are described as follows.

• Mention Detection Sieve: We in this
sieve first extract all the noun phrases,
pronouns (the words with part-of-speech
(POS) tag PN), proper nouns (the word-
s with POS tag NR) and named entities.
Thus a mention candidate set is produced.
We then refine this set by removing several
types of candidates listed as follows:

1. Themeasure words, a special word pat-
tern in Chinese such as “ ” (a year
of), “ë” (a ton of).

2. Cardinals, percents and money.

3. A mention if a larger mention with the
same head word exists.

• Discourse Processing & Pronouns

Sieve: In these two sieves, we adapt
the common pronouns to Chinese. It in-
cludes “\” (you), “·” (I or me),“�” (he
or him),“¨” (she or her),“§” (it),“\”
(plural of “you”), “·” (we or us),“�”
(they, gender: male),“¨” (they, gender:
female),“§” (plural of “it”) and relative
pronoun “gC” (self). Besides these, we
enrich the pronouns set by adding “4”, “4”, “ T” and “T” which are more often
to appear in spoken dialogs as first person
pronouns and “ s” which is used to show
respect for “you” and the third person pro-
noun “Ù”.

Besides, for mention processing of the original
system, whether a mention is singular or plural
should be given. Different from English POS
tags, in Chinese plural nouns couldn’t be distin-
guished from single nouns in terms of the POS.
Therefore, we add two rules to judge whether a
noun is plural or not.

• A noun that ends with “” (plural marker
for pronouns and a few animate nouns), and
“�” (and so on) is plural.96



• A noun phrase that involves the coordinat-
ing conjunction words such as “ Ú” (and)
is plural.

4 Experiments

4.1 Modification for the English system

We implement the semantic-similarity sieves
proposed in (Lee et al., 2011) with the WordNet.
These modifications consider the alias sieve and
lexical chain sieve. For the alias sieve, two men-
tions are marked as aliases if they appear in the
same synset in WordNet. For the lexical chain
sieve, two mentions are marked as coreference if
linked by a WordNet lexical chain that traverses
hypernymy or synonymy relations.

and because spurious mentions will be left as s-
ingletons and removed at last, a low precision
will not affect the final result. The performance
of mention detection for Chinese is worse than
that of English, and this is a direction for future
improvement for Chinese.

Our results on the development set for both
languages are listed in Table 4 and the official
test results are in Table 5. Avg F1 is the arith-
metic mean of MUC, B3, and CEAFE.

We further examine the performance by test-
ing on different data types (broadcast con-
versations, broadcast news, magazine articles,
newswire, conversational speech, and web da-
ta) of the development set, and the results are
shown in Table 6. The system do better on bn,
mz, tc than bc, nw, wb for both Chinese and
English. And it performs the worst on wb due
to a relative lower recall in mention detection.
For Chinese, we also compare the performance
when handling the three different mention types,
proper nominal, pronominal, and other nominal.
Table 7 shows the scores output by the official
scorer when only each kind of mentions are pro-
vided in the keys file and response file each time
and both the quality of the coreference links a-
mong the nominal of each mention type and the
corresponding performance of mention detection
are presented. The performance of coreference
resolution among proper nominal and pronomi-
nal is significant higher than that of other nom-
inal which highly coincides with the results in

5 Conclusion

We presented the rule-base approach for the BC-
MI’s participation in the shared task of CoNLL-
2012. We extend the work by (Lee et al., 2011)
and modified several tiers to adapt to Chinese.
Numerical results show the effectiveness in the
evaluation for Chinese and English. For the
Chinese scenario, we firstly show it is possible
to consider special POS-tags and common pro-
nouns as indicators for improving the perfor-
mance. This work could be extended by involv-
ing more feasible filtering tiers or utilizing some
automatic rule generating methods.
