Abstract

Novel neural models have been proposed
in recent years for learning under domain
shift. Most models, however, only evaluate
on a single task, on proprietary datasets, or
compare to weak baselines, which makes
comparison of models difficult. In this pa-
per, we re-evaluate classic general-purpose
bootstrapping approaches in the context of
neural networks under domain shifts vs. re-
cent neural approaches and propose a novel
multi-task tri-training method that reduces
the time and space complexity of classic
tri-training. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks are negative: while our novel
method establishes a new state-of-the-art
for sentiment analysis, it does not fare con-
sistently the best. More importantly, we
arrive at the somewhat surprising conclu-
sion that classic tri-training, with some ad-
ditions, outperforms the state of the art. We
conclude that classic approaches constitute
an important and strong baseline.

1 Introduction

Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at learning
from labeled data and have achieved state of the
art in a wide array of supervised NLP tasks such as
dependency parsing (Dozat and Manning, 2017),
named entity recognition (Lample et al., 2016), and
semantic role labeling (He et al., 2017).

In contrast, learning from unlabeled data, es-
pecially under domain shift, remains a challenge.
This is common in many real-world applications
where the distribution of the training and test data
differs. Many state-of-the-art domain adaptation
approaches leverage task-specific characteristics
such as sentiment words (Blitzer et al., 2006; Wu
and Huang, 2016) or distributional features (Schn-

abel and Schütze, 2014; Yin et al., 2015) which
do not generalize to other tasks. Other approaches
that are in theory more general only evaluate on
proprietary datasets (Kim et al., 2017) or on a sin-
gle benchmark (Zhou et al., 2016), which carries
the risk of overfitting to the task. In addition, most
models only compare against weak baselines and,
strikingly, almost none considers evaluating against
approaches from the extensive semi-supervised
learning (SSL) literature (Chapelle et al., 2006).

In this work, we make the argument that such al-
gorithms make strong baselines for any task in line
with recent efforts highlighting the usefulness of
classic approaches (Melis et al., 2017; Denkowski
and Neubig, 2017). We re-evaluate bootstrapping
algorithms in the context of DNNs. These are
general-purpose semi-supervised algorithms that
treat the model as a black box and can thus be used
easily—with a few additions—with the current gen-
eration of NLP models. Many of these methods,
though, were originally developed with in-domain
performance in mind, so their effectiveness in a
domain adaptation setting remains unexplored.

In particular, we re-evaluate three traditional
bootstrapping methods, self-training (Yarowsky,
1995), tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005), and tri-
training with disagreement (Søgaard, 2010) for
neural network-based approaches on two NLP
tasks with different characteristics, namely, a se-
quence prediction and a classification task (POS
tagging and sentiment analysis). We evaluate the
methods across multiple domains on two well-
established benchmarks, without taking any further
task-specific measures, and compare to the best
results published in the literature.

We make the somewhat surprising observation
that classic tri-training outperforms task-agnostic
state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (Laine
and Aila, 2017) and recent neural adaptation ap-
proaches (Ganin et al., 2016; Saito et al., 2017).

In addition, we propose multi-task tri-training,
which reduces the main deficiency of tri-training,
namely its time and space complexity. It establishes
a new state of the art on unsupervised domain adap-
tation for sentiment analysis but it is outperformed
by classic tri-training for POS tagging.

Contributions Our contributions are: a) We pro-
pose a novel multi-task tri-training method. b) We
show that tri-training can serve as a strong and ro-
bust semi-supervised learning baseline for the cur-
rent generation of NLP models. c) We perform an
extensive evaluation of bootstrapping1 algorithms
compared to state-of-the-art approaches on two
benchmark datasets. d) We shed light on the task
and data characteristics that yield the best perfor-
mance for each model.

2 Neural bootstrapping methods

We first introduce three classic bootstrapping meth-
ods, self-training, tri-training, and tri-training with
disagreement and detail how they can be used with
neural networks. For in-depth details we refer the
reader to (Abney, 2007; Chapelle et al., 2006; Zhu
and Goldberg, 2009). We introduce our novel multi-
task tri-training method in §2.3.

2.1 Self-training
Self-training (Yarowsky, 1995; McClosky et al.,
2006b) is one of the earliest and simplest boot-
strapping approaches. In essence, it leverages the
model’s own predictions on unlabeled data to ob-
tain additional information that can be used during
training. Typically the most confident predictions
are taken at face value, as detailed next.

Self-training trains a model m on a labeled train-
ing set L and an unlabeled data set U . At each
iteration, the model provides predictions m(x) in
the form of a probability distribution over classes
for all unlabeled examples x in U . If the proba-
bility assigned to the most likely class is higher
than a predetermined threshold τ , x is added to the
labeled examples with p(x) = argmaxm(x) as
pseudo-label. This instantiation is the most widely
used and shown in Algorithm 1.

Calibration It is well-known that output prob-
abilities in neural networks are poorly calibrated
(Guo et al., 2017). Using a fixed threshold τ is thus

1We use the term bootstrapping as used in the semi-
supervised learning literature (Zhu, 2005), which should not
be confused with the statistical procedure of the same name
(Efron and Tibshirani, 1994).

Algorithm 1 Self-training (Abney, 2007)
1: repeat
2: m← train_model(L)
3: for x ∈ U do
4: if maxm(x) > τ then
5: L← L ∪ {(x, p(x))}
6: until no more predictions are confident

not the best choice. While the absolute confidence
value is inaccurate, we can expect that the relative
order of confidences is more robust.

For this reason, we select the top n unlabeled
examples that have been predicted with the high-
est confidence after every epoch and add them to
the labeled data. This is one of the many variants
for self-training, called throttling (Abney, 2007).
We empirically confirm that this outperforms the
classic selection in our experiments.

Online learning In contrast to many classic al-
gorithms, DNNs are trained online by default. We
compare training setups and find that training until
convergence on labeled data and then training until
convergence using self-training performs best.

Classic self-training has shown mixed success.
In parsing it proved successful only with small
datasets (Reichart and Rappoport, 2007) or when
a generative component is used together with a
reranker in high-data conditions (McClosky et al.,
2006b; Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008). Some success
was achieved with careful task-specific data se-
lection (Petrov and McDonald, 2012), while oth-
ers report limited success on a variety of NLP
tasks (Plank, 2011; Van Asch and Daelemans,
2016; van der Goot et al., 2017). Its main down-
side is that the model is not able to correct its own
mistakes and errors are amplified, an effect that is
increased under domain shift.

2.2 Tri-training

Tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005) is a classic method
that reduces the bias of predictions on unlabeled
data by utilizing the agreement of three indepen-
dently trained models. Tri-training (cf. Algorithm
2) first trains three models m1, m2, and m3 on
bootstrap samples of the labeled data L. An unla-
beled data point is added to the training set of a
modelmi if the other two modelsmj andmk agree
on its label. Training stops when the classifiers do
not change anymore.

Tri-training with disagreement (Søgaard, 2010)



1046

Algorithm 2 Tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005)
1: for i ∈ {1..3} do
2: Si ← bootstrap_sample(L)
3: mi ← train_model(Si)
4: repeat
5: for i ∈ {1..3} do
6: Li ← ∅
7: for x ∈ U do
8: if pj(x) = pk(x)(j, k 6= i) then
9: Li ← Li ∪ {(x, pj(x))}

mi ← train_model(L ∪ Li)
10: until none of mi changes
11: apply majority vote over mi

is based on the intuition that a model should only
be strengthened in its weak points and that the
labeled data should not be skewed by easy data
points. In order to achieve this, it adds a simple
modification to the original algorithm (altering line
8 in Algorithm 2), requiring that for an unlabeled
data point on which mj and mk agree, the other
model mi disagrees on the prediction. Tri-training
with disagreement is more data-efficient than tri-
training and has achieved competitive results on
part-of-speech tagging (Søgaard, 2010).

Sampling unlabeled data Both tri-training and
tri-training with disagreement can be very expen-
sive in their original formulation as they require to
produce predictions for each of the three models
on all unlabeled data samples, which can be in the
millions in realistic applications. We thus propose
to sample a number of unlabeled examples at every
epoch. For all traditional bootstrapping approaches
we sample 10k candidate instances in each epoch.
For the neural approaches we use a linearly grow-
ing candidate sampling scheme proposed by (Saito
et al., 2017), increasing the candidate pool size as
the models become more accurate.

Confidence thresholding Similar to self-
training, we can introduce an additional require-
ment that pseudo-labeled examples are only added
if the probability of the prediction of at least one
model is higher than some threshold τ . We did not
find this to outperform prediction without threshold
for traditional tri-training, but thresholding proved
essential for our method (§2.3).

The most important condition for tri-training and
tri-training with disagreement is that the models
are diverse. Typically, bootstrap samples are used

Figure 1: Multi-task tri-training (MT-Tri).

to create this diversity (Zhou and Li, 2005; Sø-
gaard, 2010). However, training separate models
on bootstrap samples of a potentially large amount
of training data is expensive and takes a lot of time.
This drawback motivates our approach.

2.3 Multi-task tri-training
In order to reduce both the time and space com-
plexity of tri-training, we propose Multi-task Tri-
training (MT-Tri). MT-Tri leverages insights from
multi-task learning (MTL) (Caruana, 1993) to share
knowledge across models and accelerate training.
Rather than storing and training each model sepa-
rately, we propose to share the parameters of the
models and train them jointly using MTL.2 All
models thus collaborate on learning a joint repre-
sentation, which improves convergence.

The output softmax layers are model-specific
and are only updated for the input of the respective
model. We show the model in Figure 1 (as instan-
tiated for POS tagging). As the models leverage
a joint representation, we need to ensure that the
features used for prediction in the softmax layers
of the different models are as diverse as possible,
so that the models can still learn from each other’s
predictions. In contrast, if the parameters in all
output softmax layers were the same, the method
would degenerate to self-training.

To guarantee diversity, we introduce an orthog-
onality constraint (Bousmalis et al., 2016) as an
additional loss term, which we define as follows:

Lorth = ‖W>m1Wm2‖
2
F (1)

where | · ‖2F is the squared Frobenius norm and
Wm1 and Wm2 are the softmax output parameters

2Note: we use the term multi-task learning here albeit all
tasks are of the same kind, similar to work on multi-lingual
modeling treating each language (but same label space) as
separate task e.g., (Fang and Cohn, 2017). It is interesting to
point out that our model is further doing implicit multi-view
learning by way of the orthogonality constraint.



1047

of the two source and pseudo-labeled output layers
m1 and m2, respectively. The orthogonality con-
straint encourages the models not to rely on the
same features for prediction. As enforcing pair-
wise orthogonality between three matrices is not
possible, we only enforce orthogonality between
the softmax output layers of m1 and m2,3 while
m3 is gradually trained to be more target-specific.
We parameterize Lorth by γ=0.01 following (Liu
et al., 2017). We do not further tune γ.

More formally, let us illustrate the model by
taking the sequence prediction task (Figure 1) as il-
lustration. Given an utterance with labels y1, .., yn,
our Multi-task Tri-training loss consists of three
task-specific (m1,m2,m3) tagging loss functions
(where ~h is the uppermost Bi-LSTM encoding):

L(θ) = −
∑
i

∑
1,..,n

logPmi(y|~h) + γLorth (2)

In contrast to classic tri-training, we can train
the multi-task model with its three model-specific
outputs jointly and without bootstrap sampling on
the labeled source domain data until convergence,
as the orthogonality constraint enforces different
representations between models m1 and m2. From
this point, we can leverage the pair-wise agreement
of two output layers to add pseudo-labeled exam-
ples as training data to the third model. We train the
third output layerm3 only on pseudo-labeled target
instances in order to make tri-training more robust
to a domain shift. For the final prediction, major-
ity voting of all three output layers is used, which
resulted in the best instantiation, together with con-
fidence thresholding (τ = 0.9, except for high-
resource POS where τ = 0.8 performed slightly
better). We also experimented with using a domain-
adversarial loss (Ganin et al., 2016) on the jointly
learned representation, but found this not to help.
The full pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 3.

Computational complexity The motivation for
MT-Tri was to reduce the space and time complex-
ity of tri-training. We thus give an estimate of
its efficiency gains. MT-Tri is ~3× more space-
efficient than regular tri-training; tri-training stores
one set of parameters for each of the three mod-
els, while MT-Tri only stores one set of parameters
(we use three output layers, but these make up a
comparatively small part of the total parameter bud-
get). In terms of time efficiency, tri-training first

3We also tried enforcing orthogonality on a hidden layer
rather than the output layer, but this did not help.

Algorithm 3 Multi-task Tri-training
1: m← train_model(L)
2: repeat
3: for i ∈ {1..3} do
4: Li ← ∅
5: for x ∈ U do
6: if pj(x) = pk(x)(j, k 6= i) then
7: Li ← Li ∪ {(x, pj(x))}
8: if i = 3 then mi = train_model(Li)
9: elsemi ← train_model(L ∪ Li)

10: until end condition is met

requires to train each of the models from scratch.
The actual tri-training takes about the same time as
training from scratch and requires a separate for-
ward pass for each model, effectively training three
independent models simultaneously. In contrast,
MT-Tri only necessitates one forward pass as well
as the evaluation of the two additional output lay-
ers (which takes a negligible amount of time) and
requires about as many epochs as tri-training until
convergence (see Table 3, second column) while
adding fewer unlabeled examples per epoch (see
Section 3.4). In our experiments, MT-Tri trained
about 5-6× faster than traditional tri-training.

MT-Tri can be seen as a self-ensembling tech-
nique, where different variations of a model are
used to create a stronger ensemble prediction. Re-
cent approaches in this line are snapshot ensem-
bling (Huang et al., 2017) that ensembles models
converged to different minima during a training run,
asymmetric tri-training (Saito et al., 2017) (ASYM)
that leverages agreement on two models as informa-
tion for the third, and temporal ensembling (Laine
and Aila, 2017), which ensembles predictions of a
model at different epochs. We tried to compare to
temporal ensembling in our experiments, but were
not able to obtain consistent results.4 We compare
to the closest most recent method, asymmetric tri-
training (Saito et al., 2017). It differs from ours
in two aspects: a) ASYM leverages only pseudo-
labels from data points on which m1 and m2 agree,
and b) it uses only one task (m3) as final predictor.
In essence, our formulation of MT-Tri is closer to
the original tri-training formulation (agreements
on two provide pseudo-labels to the third) thereby
incorporating more diversity.

4We suspect that the sparse features in NLP and the domain
shift might be detrimental to its unsupervised consistency loss.

Table 1: Number of labeled and unlabeled sen-
tences for each domain in the SANCL 2012 dataset
(Petrov and McDonald, 2012) for POS tagging
(above) and the Amazon Reviews dataset (Blitzer
et al., 2006) for sentiment analysis (below).

3 Experiments

In order to ascertain which methods are ro-
bust across different domains, we evaluate on
two widely used unsupervised domain adaptation
datasets for two tasks, a sequence labeling and a
classification task, cf. Table 1 for data statistics.

3.1 POS tagging

For POS tagging we use the SANCL 2012 shared
task dataset (Petrov and McDonald, 2012) and com-
pare to the top results in both low and high-data
conditions (Schnabel and Schütze, 2014; Yin et al.,
2015). Both are strong baselines, as the FLORS tag-
ger has been developed for this challenging dataset
and it is based on contextual distributional features
(excluding the word’s identity), and hand-crafted
suffix and shape features (including some language-
specific morphological features). We want to gauge
to what extent we can adopt a nowadays fairly stan-
dard (but more lexicalized) general neural tagger.

Our POS tagging model is a state-of-the-art
Bi-LSTM tagger (Plank et al., 2016) with word
and 100-dim character embeddings. Word embed-
dings are initialized with the 100-dim Glove em-
beddings (Pennington et al., 2014). The BiLSTM
has one hidden layer with 100 dimensions. The
base POS model is trained on WSJ with early stop-
ping on the WSJ development set, using patience
2, Gaussian noise with σ = 0.2 and word dropout
with p = 0.25 (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016).

Regarding data, the source domain is the
Ontonotes 4.0 release of the Penn treebank Wall
Street Journal (WSJ) annotated for 48 fine-grained
POS tags. This amounts to 30,060 labeled sen-

tences. We use 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988
as unlabeled data, following Schnabel and Schütze
(2014).5 As target data, we use the five SANCL
domains (answers, emails, newsgroups, reviews,
weblogs). We restrict the amount of unlabeled data
for each SANCL domain to the first 100k sentences,
and do not do any pre-processing. We consider the
development set of ANSWERS as our only target
dev set to set hyperparameters. This may result in
suboptimal per-domain settings but better resem-
bles an unsupervised adaptation scenario.

3.2 Sentiment analysis

For sentiment analysis, we evaluate on the Amazon
reviews dataset (Blitzer et al., 2006). Reviews with
1 to 3 stars are ranked as negative, while reviews
with 4 or 5 stars are ranked as positive. The dataset
consists of four domains, yielding 12 adaptation
scenarios. We use the same pre-processing and
architecture as used in (Ganin et al., 2016; Saito
et al., 2017): 5,000-dimensional tf-idf weighted
unigram and bigram features as input; 2k labeled
source samples and 2k unlabeled target samples
for training, 200 labeled target samples for valida-
tion, and between 3k-6k samples for testing. The
model is an MLP with one hidden layer with 50
dimensions, sigmoid activations, and a softmax
output. We compare against the Variational Fair
Autoencoder (VFAE) (Louizos et al., 2015) model
and domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN)
(Ganin et al., 2016).

3.3 Baselines

Besides comparing to the top results published on
both datasets, we include the following baselines:

a) the task model trained on the source domain;
b) self-training (Self);
c) tri-training (Tri);
d) tri-training with disagreement (Tri-D); and
e) asymmetric tri-training (Saito et al., 2017).

Our proposed model is multi-task tri-training (MT-
Tri). We implement our models in DyNet (Neu-
big et al., 2017). Reporting single evaluation
scores might result in biased results (Reimers and
Gurevych, 2017). Throughout the paper, we re-
port mean accuracy and standard deviation over
five runs for POS tagging and over ten runs for

5Note that our unlabeled data might slightly differ from
theirs. We took the first 100k sentences from the 1988 WSJ
dataset from the BLLIP 1987-89 WSJ Corpus Release 1.

ment analysis for all 12 domain adaptation sce-
narios in Figure 2. For clarity, we also show the
accuracy scores averaged across each target domain
as well as a global macro average in Table 2.

Self-training achieves surprisingly good results
but is not able to compete with tri-training. Tri-
training with disagreement is only slightly better
than self-training, showing that the disagreement
component might not be useful when there is a
strong domain shift. Tri-training achieves the best

average results on two target domains and clearly
outperforms the state of the art on average.

MT-Tri finally outperforms the state of the art
on 3/4 domains, and even slightly traditional tri-
training, resulting in the overall best method. This
improvement is mainly due to the B->E and D->E
scenarios, on which tri-training struggles. These
domain pairs are among those with the highest A-
distance (Blitzer et al., 2007), which highlights
that tri-training has difficulty dealing with a strong
shift in domain. Our method is able to mitigate this
deficiency by training one of the three output layers
only on pseudo-labeled target domain examples.

In addition, MT-Tri is more efficient as it adds a
smaller number of pseudo-labeled examples than
tri-training at every epoch. For sentiment analysis,
tri-training adds around 1800-1950/2000 unlabeled
examples at every epoch, while MT-Tri only adds
around 100-300 in early epochs. This shows that
the orthogonality constraint is useful for inducing
diversity. In addition, adding fewer examples poses
a smaller risk of swamping the learned represen-
tations with useless signals and is more akin to
fine-tuning, the standard method for supervised
domain adaptation (Howard and Ruder, 2018).

We observe an asymmetry in the results between
some of the domain pairs, e.g. B->D and D->B.
We hypothesize that the asymmetry may be due to
properties of the data and that the domains are rela-
tively far apart e.g., in terms of A-distance. In fact,
asymmetry in these domains is already reflected

in the results of Blitzer et al. (2007) and is cor-
roborated in the results for asymmetric tri-training
(Saito et al., 2017) and our method.

We note a weakness of this dataset is high vari-
ance. Existing approaches only report the mean,
which makes an objective comparison difficult. For
this reason, we believe it is essential to evaluate
proposed approaches also on other tasks.

POS tagging Results for tagging in the low-data
regime (10% of WSJ) are given in Table 3.

Self-training does not work for the sequence
prediction task. We report only the best instantia-

tion (throttling with n=800). Our results contribute
to negative findings regarding self-training (Plank,
2011; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2016).

In the low-data setup, tri-training with disagree-
ment works best, reaching an overall average ac-
curacy of 89.70, closely followed by classic tri-
training, and significantly outperforming the base-
line on 4/5 domains. The exception is newsgroups,
a difficult domain with high OOV rate where none
of the approches beats the baseline (see §3.4). Our
proposed MT-Tri is better than asymmetric tri-
training, but falls below classic tri-training. It beats

the baseline significantly on only 2/5 domains (an-
swers and emails). The FLORS tagger (Yin et al.,
2015) fares better. Its contextual distributional fea-
tures are particularly helpful on unknown word-tag
combinations (see § 3.4), which is a limitation of
the lexicalized generic bi-LSTM tagger.

For the high-data setup (Table 4) results are simi-
lar. Disagreement, however, is only favorable in the
low-data setups; the effect of avoiding easy points
no longer holds in the full data setup. Classic tri-
training is the best method. In particular, traditional
tri-training is complementary to word embedding
initialization, pushing the non-pre-trained baseline
to the level of SRC with Glove initalization. Tri-
training pushes performance even further and re-
sults in the best model, significantly outperform-
ing the baseline again in 4/5 cases, and reaching
FLORS performance on weblogs. Multi-task tri-
training is often slightly more effective than asym-
metric tri-training (Saito et al., 2017); however,
improvements for both are not robust across do-
mains, sometimes performance even drops. The
model likely is too simplistic for such a high-data
POS setup, and exploring shared-private models
might prove more fruitful (Liu et al., 2017). On the
test sets, tri-training performs consistently the best.

POS analysis We analyze POS tagging accu-
racy with respect to word frequency6 and unseen
word-tag combinations (UWT) on the dev sets.
Table 5 (top rows) provides percentage of un-

known tags, OOVs and unknown word-tag (UWT)
rate. The SANCL dataset is overall very chal-
lenging: OOV rates are high (6.8-11% compared
to 2.3% in WSJ), so is the unknown word-tag
(UWT) rate (answers and emails contain 2.91%
and 3.47% UWT compared to 0.61% on WSJ) and
almost all target domains even contain unknown
tags (Schnabel and Schütze, 2014) (unknown tags:
ADD,GW,NFP,XX), except for weblogs. Email is
the domain with the highest OOV rate and highest
unknown-tag-for-known-words rate. We plot ac-
curacy with respect to word frequency on email in
Figure 3, analyzing how the three methods fare in
comparison to the baseline on this difficult domain.

Regarding OOVs, the results in Table 5 (second
part) show that classic tri-training outperforms the
source model (trained on only source data) on 3/5
domains in terms of OOV accuracy, except on two
domains with high OOV rate (newsgroups and we-
blogs). In general, we note that tri-training works
best on OOVs and on low-frequency tokens, which
is also shown in Figure 3 (leftmost bins). Both
other methods fall typically below the baseline in
terms of OOV accuracy, but MT-Tri still outper-
forms Asym in 4/5 cases. Table 5 (last part) also
shows that no bootstrapping method works well
on unknown word-tag combinations. UWT tokens
are very difficult to predict correctly using an un-
supervised approach; the less lexicalized and more
context-driven approach taken by FLORS is clearly
superior for these cases, resulting in higher UWT
accuracies for 4/5 domains.

4 Related work

Learning under Domain Shift There is a large
body of work on domain adaptation. Studies
on unsupervised domain adaptation include early
work on bootstrapping (Steedman et al., 2003;
McClosky et al., 2006a), shared feature represen-
tations (Blitzer et al., 2006, 2007) and instance
weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007). Recent ap-



1052

proaches include adversarial learning (Ganin et al.,
2016) and fine-tuning (Sennrich et al., 2016). There
is almost no work on bootstrapping approaches
for recent neural NLP, in particular under domain
shift. Tri-training is less studied, and only recently
re-emerged in the vision community (Saito et al.,
2017), albeit is not compared to classic tri-training.

Neural network ensembling Related work on
self-ensembling approaches includes snapshot en-
sembling (Huang et al., 2017) or temporal ensem-
bling (Laine and Aila, 2017). In general, the line be-
tween “explicit” and “implicit” ensembling (Huang
et al., 2017), like dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)
or temporal ensembling (Saito et al., 2017), is more
fuzzy. As we noted earlier our multi-task learning
setup can be seen as a form of self-ensembling.

Multi-task learning in NLP Neural networks
are particularly well-suited for MTL allowing for
parameter sharing (Caruana, 1993). Recent NLP
conferences witnessed a “tsunami” of deep learn-
ing papers (Manning, 2015), followed by what
we call a multi-task learning “wave”: MTL has
been successfully applied to a wide range of NLP
tasks (Cohn and Specia, 2013; Cheng et al., 2015;
Luong et al., 2015; Plank et al., 2016; Fang and
Cohn, 2016; Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016; Ruder
et al., 2017; Augenstein et al., 2018). Related to
it is the pioneering work on adversarial learning
(DANN) (Ganin et al., 2016). For sentiment analy-
sis we found tri-training and our MT-Tri model to
outperform DANN. Our MT-Tri model lends itself
well to shared-private models such as those pro-
posed recently (Liu et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017),
which extend upon (Ganin et al., 2016) by having
separate source and target-specific encoders.

5 Conclusions

We re-evaluate a range of traditional general-
purpose bootstrapping algorithms in the context
of neural network approaches to semi-supervised
learning under domain shift. For the two examined
NLP tasks classic tri-training works the best and
even outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method.
The drawback of tri-training it its time and space
complexity. We therefore propose a more efficient
multi-task tri-training model, which outperforms
both traditional tri-training and recent alternatives
in the case of sentiment analysis. For POS tag-
ging, classic tri-training is superior, performing
especially well on OOVs and low frequency to-

kens, which suggests it is less affected by error
propagation. Overall we emphasize the importance
of comparing neural approaches to strong baselines
and reporting results across several runs.
