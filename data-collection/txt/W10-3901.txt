Query Understanding in Web Search
- by Large Scale Log Data Mining and Statistical Learning

Abstract

Query understanding is an important component of web search, like document understanding,
query document matching, ranking, and user understanding. The goal of query understanding is
to predict the user’s search intent from the given query. Needless to say, search log mining and
statistical learning are fundamental technologies to address the task of query understanding. In
this talk, I will first introduce a large-scale search log mining platform which we have devel-
oped at MSRA. I will then explain our approach to query understanding, as well as document
understanding, query document matching, and user understanding. After that, I will describe in
details about our methods for query understanding based on statistical learning. They include
query refinement using CRF, named entity recognition in query using topic model, context
aware query topic prediction using HMM.

This is joint work with Gu Xu, Daxin Jiang and other collaborators.
