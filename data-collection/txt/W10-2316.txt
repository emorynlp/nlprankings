Abstract

This paper focuses on redundancy, over-
lapping information in multi-documents,
and presents a method for detecting
salient, key sentences from documents
that discuss the same event. To elimi-
nate redundancy, we used spectral clus-
tering and classified each sentence into
groups, each of which consists of seman-
tically related sentences. Then, we ap-
plied link analysis, the Markov Random
Walk (MRW) Model to deciding the im-
portance of a sentence within documents.
The method was tested on the NTCIR
evaluation data, and the result shows the
effectiveness of the method.

1 Introduction

With the exponential growth of information on the
Internet, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a
user to read and understand all the materials from
a series of large-scale document streams that is po-
tentially of interest. Multi-document summariza-
tion is an issue to attack the problem. It differs
from single document summarization in that it is
important to identify differences and similarities
across documents. Graph-based ranking methods,
such as PageRank (Page et al., 1998) and HITS
(Kleinberg, 1999) have recently applied and been
successfully used for multi-document summariza-
tion (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau,
2005). Given a set of documents, the model con-
structs graph consisting vertices and edges where
vertices are sentences and edges reflect the rela-
tionships between sentences. The model then ap-
plies a graph-based ranking method to obtain the
rank scores for the sentences. Finally, the sen-
tences with large rank scores are chosen into the
summary. However, when they are strung to-
gether, the resulting summary still contains much

overlapping information. Because all the sen-
tences are ranked based on a sentence as unit of
information. Therefore, for example, semanti-
cally related two sentences with “high recommen-
dation” are ranked with high score, and thus are
regarded as a summary sentence. To attack the
problem, Wan et al. proposed two models, i.e., the
Cluster-based conditional Markov Random Walk
model and the Cluster-based HITS model, both
make use of the theme clusters in the document set
(Wan and Yang, 2008). Their model first groups
documents into theme clusters by using a simple
clustering method, k-means. Next, the model con-
structs a directed or undirected graph to reflect the
relationships between sentences and clusters by
using link analysis. They reported that the results
on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets showed
the effectiveness of their models. However, one
of the problems using multivariate clustering such
as k-means is that it is something of a black art
when applied to high-dimensional data. The avail-
able techniques for searching this large space do
not offer guarantees of global optimality, thus the
resulting summary still contains much overlapping
information, especially for a large amount of doc-
uments.

This paper focuses extractive summarization,
and present a method for detecting key sentences
from documents that discuss the same event. Like
Wan et al.’s approach, we applied link analysis,
the Markov Random Walk (MRW) model (Bre-
maud, 1999) to a graph consisting sentences and
clusters. To attack the problem dealing with the
high dimensional spaces, we applied spectral clus-
tering technique (Ng et al., 2002) to the sentences
from a document set. Spectral clustering is a trans-
formation of the original sentences into a set of or-
thogonal eigenvectors. We worked in the space de-
fined by the first few eigenvectors, using standard
clustering techniques in the transformed space.

2 Spectral Clustering

Similar to other clustering algorithms, the spec-
tral clustering takes as input a matrix formed from
a pairwise similarity function over a set of data
points. Given a set of points S = {s1, · · · , sn}
in a high dimensional space, the algorithm is as
follows:

1. Form a distance matrix D ∈ R2. We used
cosine similarity as a distance measure.

2. D is transformed to an affinity matrix Aij .

Aij =

{
exp(−D

2
ij

σ2
), if i �= j

0, otherwise.

σ2 is a parameter and controls the rate at
which affinity drops off with distance.

3. The matrix L = D−1/2AD−1/2 is created. D
is a diagonal matrix whose (i,i) element is the
sum of A’s i-th row.

4. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of L are
computed, and a new matrix is created from
the vectors associated with the number of l
largest eigenvalues.

5. Each item now has a vector of l coordinates
in the transformed space. These vectors are
normalized to unit length.

6. K-means is applied to S in the l-dimensional
space.

3 Cluster-based Link Analysis

The link analysis we used is an approach presented
by Wan et. al (Wan and Yang, 2008). The model
called “Cluster-based Conditional Markov Ran-
dom Walk Model” incorporates the cluster-level
information into the process of sentence rank-
ing. The model is summarized as follows: Let
π(clus(si)) ∈ [0, 1] be the importance of clus-
ter clus(si) in the whole document set D. Let
also ω(si, clus(si)) ∈ [0, 1] denote the strength of
the correlation between sentence si and its cluster
clus(si). clus(si) refers to the cluster containing
sentence si. The transition probability from si to
sj is defined by formula (1).

p(i→j|clus(si), clus(sj))

=

8>>><
>>>:

f(i→j|clus(si), clus(sj))
|S|X
k=1

f(i→k|clus(si), clus(sk))
, if Σf �= 0

0 , otherwise.

(1)

f(i → j | clus(si), clus(sj)) in formula (1) refers
to the weight between two sentences si and sj ,
conditioned on the two clusters containing the two
sentences, and defined by formula (2).

f(i→j|clus(si), clus(sj))
= f(i→j)·{λ·π(clus(si))·ω(clus(si))

+(1− λ)·π(clus(sj))·ω(clus(sj))} (2)

λ ∈ [0, 1] in formula (2) is the combination
weight controlling the relative contributions from
the source cluster and the destination cluster.
π(clus(si)) denotes the value indicating the im-
portance of the cluster clus(si) in the document
set D. Similarly, ω(si, clus(si)) refers to the sim-
ilarity value between the sentence si and its cluster
clus(si). These values are obtained by using the
cosine similarity. The new row-normalized matrix
M is defined by formula (3).

Mij = p(i → j | clus(si), clus(sj)) (3)

The saliency scores for the sentences are com-
puted based on formula (3) by using the iterative
form in formula (4).

Score(si) = μ
X

allj �=i
Score(sj) · Mji + (1 − μ)| S | (4)

μ in formula (4) is the damping factor, which we
set to 0.85. The above process can be considered
as a Markov chain by taking the sentences as the
states and the final transition matrix is given by
formula (5), and each score of the sentences is ob-
tained by the principle eigenvector of the new tran-
sition matrix A.

A = μMT +
(1− μ)
| V | �e�e

T (5)

�e in formula (5) is a column vector with all ele-
ments equal to 1. We selected a certain number
of sentences according to rank score into the sum-
mary.

4 Experiments

We had an experiment by using the NTCIR-31

SUMM to evaluate our approach. NTCIR-3 has
two tasks, single, and multi-document summariza-
tion. The data is collected from two years(1998-
1999) Mainichi Japanese Newspaper articles. We
used multi-document summarization task. There
are two types of gold standard data provided to
human judges, FBFREE DryRun and FormalRun,
each of which consists of 30 topics. There are two
types of correct summary according to the charac-
ter length, i.e., “long” and “short”. All documents
were tagged by a morphological analysis, ChaSen
(Matsumoto et al., 1997) and noun words are ex-
tracted.

We used FormalRun consisting of 30 topics as a
test data. Similarly, we randomly chose 10 topics
from the FBFREE DryRun data to tuning a param-
eter σ in Spectral Clustering, and the number of l
in the l-dimensional space obtained by the Spec-
tral Clustering. σ is searched in steps of 0.01 from
1.0 to 5.0. l in the l-dimensional space is searched
in steps 10% from 0 to 80% against the total num-
ber of words in the training data. The size that op-
timized the average F-score of 10 topics was cho-
sen. Here, F-score is the standard measure used
in the clustering algorithm, and it combines recall
and precision with an equal weight. Precision is a
ratio of the number of correct pair of sentences ob-
tained by the k-means divided by the total number
of pairs obtained by the k-means. Recall indicates
a ratio of the number of correct pair of sentences
obtained by the k-means divided by the total num-
ber of correct pairs. As a result, σ and l are set to
4.5 and 80%, respectively.

It is difficult to predict the actual cluster number
k in a given input sentences to produce optimal
results. The usual drawback in many clustering
algorithms is that they cannot give a valid criterion
for measuring class structure. Therefore, similar
to Wan et. al’s method (Wan and Yang, 2008), we
typically set the number of k of expected clusters
as

√
N where N is the number of all sentences

in the document set. We used these values of the
parameters and evaluated by using test data.

We used two evaluation measures. One is co-
sine similarity between the generated summary by
the system and the human generated summary.
Another is ROUGE score used in DUC (Liu and
Hovy, 2003).

ROUGE =

We used a word instead of n-gram sequence in
formula (6). The results are shown in Table 1. “#
of doc” and “# of sent” refer to the average number
of documents and sentences, respectively. “# of
sum” denotes to the average number of summary
sentences provided by NTCIR3 SUMM. “cos” and
“ROUGE” refer to the results evaluated by using
cosine, and ROUGE score, respectively. “MRW”
indicates the results obtained by directly applying
MRW model to the input sentences.

We can see from Table 1 that our approach
(Spectral) outperforms the baselines, “MRW”
and “k-means”, regardless of the types of sum-
mary (long/short) and evaluation measures (co-
sine/ROUGE). The results obtained by three ap-
proaches show that “short” was better than “long”.
This indicates that the rank score of correct sen-
tences within the candidate sentences obtained
by the MRW model works well. Comparing
the results evaluated by “ROUGE” were worse
than those of “cos” at any approaches. One rea-
son is that the difference of summarization tech-
nique, i.e., our work is extractive summarization,
while the gold standard data provided by NTCIR-
3 SUMM is the abstracts written by human pro-
fessionals. As a result, a large number of words
in a candidate summary are extracted by our ap-
proaches. For future work, it is necessary to ex-
tend our method to involve paraphrasing for ex-
tracted key sentences to reduce the gap between
automatically generated summaries and human-
written abstracts (Barzilay et al., 1993; Carenini
and Cheung, 2008).

It is interesting to note how our approach affects
for the number of sentences as an input. Figure
1 illustrates the results of summary “long” with
evaluated ROUGE score. We can see from Figure
1 that our approach is more robust than k-means
and the MRW model, even for a large number of
input data. We have seen the same observations
from other three results, i.e., the results of short
and long with evaluated cos and short with evalu-
ated ROUGE.

We recall that the cluster number k is set to the
square root of the sentence number. We tested dif-
ferent number of k to see how the cluster number

affects the summarization performance. In the ex-
periment, we set k = r∗ | N | where r is a pa-
rameter ranged from 0 to 1 (Wan and Yang, 2008).
Because of space is limited, we report only the re-
sult with summary “long” and ROUGE score. The
result is shown in Figure 2.

Overall the results obtained by our approach
and k-means outperformed the results obtained
by directly applying MRW model, while the re-
sults by k-means was worse than the results by
MRW model when the ratio of the number of sen-
tences was larger than 0.8. This shows that cluster-
based summarization is effective reduce redun-
dancy, overlapping information. Figure 2 also
shows that our approach always outperforms, re-
gardless of how many number of sentences were
used. This indicates that the MRW model with
spectral clustering is more robust than that with
the baseline, k-means, with respect to the differ-
ent number of clusters.

duce redundancy, such as (Zhu et al., 2007), (ii)
applying the method to the DUC evaluation data
for quantitative evaluation, and (iii) extending the
method to classify sentences into more than one
classes by using soft-clustering techniques such as

gorithms (Zhang and Wang, 2007).
