Abstract 

The presentation will mainly cover (1) 

What is HowNet? HowNet is an on-line 

common-sense knowledgebase unveiling 

inter-conceptual relationships and inter-

attribute relationships of concepts as 

connoting in lexicons of the Chinese and 

their English equivalents. (2) How it 

functions in the computation of meaning 

and as a NLP platform? The presentation 

will show 9 HowNet-based application 

tools. All of them are not merely demon-

stration of some methodology or algo-

rithm, but are real application tools that 

can be tested by users themselves. Apart 

from the tools that are specially designed 

to deal with Chinese, most of the tools 

are bilingual, even the WSD tool. 

1  What is HowNet 

HowNet is an on-line common-sense knowled-

gebase unveiling inter-conceptual relationships 

and inter-attribute relationships of concepts as 

connoting in lexicons of the Chinese and their 

English equivalents. To put it simply, relation-

ship is the soul of HowNet, as well as the world 

knowledge. The relationships that represent 

knowledge can be divided into two categories: 

Concept Relationship (CR) and Attribute Rela-

tionship (AR). 

It is believed that concept relationships fall in-

to a net, which is called Concept Relation Net 

(CRN) and attribute relationships fall into a net 

too, called Attribute Relation Net (ARN). Dif-

ferent individual has different CRN, even of the 

same concept. This reflects different levels of 

knowledge among people. CRN is elastic or ex-

tendable as it varies with individual persons. The 

more knowledge one has, the more concepts he 

will master, and what is more, the larger or more 

complicated CRN of the concepts he will know. 

It can be imagined that a 6-year child may know 

“doctor” but his CRN of “doctor” would be far 

from that as shown in Fig. 1, which is believed 

to be mastered by an ordinary adult. The same 

case goes with mankind as a whole. Mankind 

increases his knowledge with each passing year 

when he enlarges his volume of concepts and at 

the same time, the CRN of the concepts. 

Careful observations find that the meaning of 

concepts is displayed not only by its CRN but 

also by the relationships among attributes of the 

concepts, as called Attribute Relation Net. In 

many cases it is the attributes of a concept that 

act in the role of meaning representation. Fig. 2 

reveals that it is not “paper” as a whole that is 

related to “write”, but only one of its attributes, 

say “color”, is related to “write” with “contrast” 

as the condition. Therefore in a strict sense, “pa-

per” is not necessarily related to “write”. We can 

sometimes even write on the sand with a twig or 

on the table with our wet finger. On the contrary, 

we cannot write on a piece of white paper with a 

chalk or on the blackboard in black ink. There-

fore, for writing, what affects may not be the 

whole lot of the concept like “paper”, but some 

attributes of the concept. Besides, we can use 

“paper” to wrap up something because of its 

attributes of the material, which are almost the 

same as cloth or plastic. HowNet is unique in its 

four peculiarities: (1) Use of sememes: HowNet 

uses sememes to interpret concepts. Sememes 

are regarded as the basic unit of the meaning. (2) 

Definition in a structuralized language: Each 

concept in HowNet lexicon is defined in a lan-

guage, called Knowledge Database Markup 

Language (KDML). The KDML is mainly com-

posed of sememes and semantic roles. The  

53

Knowledge Database Mark-up Language uses 

2089 sememes, 128 secondary features and 94 

semantic roles as its vocabulary and adopts an 

extended BNF as its syntax. The concept of 

“doctor (medical)” is defined in HowNet as:   
DEF={human|人:HostOf={Occupation|职位}, 

condition 

value value value value 

material material instrument 

patient 
instrument 

attribute attribute attribute attribute 

paper 

color thickness hardness 

white thin flammable soft 

write 

contrast 

shopping bag 

make burn 

flammableness 

54



domain={medical|医},{doctor|医治:agent={~}}} 

All the computation of meaning in HowNet 

is based on the definitions of the concepts.  

(3) Self-sufficiency: Systematic integration 

of hierarchical taxonomies, axiomatic inference, 

KDML-defined concepts. 

(4) Language independence: In the final 

analysis, HowNet is not word-oriented as 

WordNet, but concept-oriented. Only with the 

HowNet’s shared definitions can we achieve a 

shared ontology for all languages.

2 HowNet functions as a NLP platform 

HowNet is developing toward a NLP platform. 

HowNet is a powerful tool for the computation 

of meaning. To date, 9 HowNet-based applica-

tion tools have been developed. They are: 

1. HowNet_Browser (E/C bilingual) 

2. HowNet_Relevance (E/C bilingual) 

3. HowNet_Similarity (E/C bilingual) 

4. HowNet_Inference_Pool (E/C bilingual) 

5. HowNet_SenseColonyTester (E/C bilin-

gual) 

6. HowNet_Translate (E-to-C) 

7.HowNet_Morpho_Processor (Chinese mo-

nolingual) 

8. HowNet_VN – disambiguator for Chinese 

V-N structure (Chinese monolingual) 

9. HowNet_VXY -- disambiguator for Chi-

nese V-N-的-N structure  (Chinese monolingual) 

The purpose for developing these tools is (1) 

to check the HowNet’s data and framework for 

its accuracy and coverage so as to test the 

soundness of its philosophy and design; (2) to 

push HowNet near to end applications so as to 

provide evidence of its value as knowledge re-

sources; 

Of all these tools, HowNet Browser is the 

key. The Browser contains all HowNet basic 

data and provides various kinds of elementary 

or shallow computation of meanings. The basic 

data in HowNet can be divided into two parts: 

firstly, the basic lexical data and secondly tax-

onomies. In the lexical database, each concept 

is described in a fixed structure, for example, 

 

NO.=046048 

W_C=富 
G_C=adj [fu4] 

S_C=PlusSentiment|正面评价 
E_C=~人，~婆，~国，~家子弟，~得流油，
穷的穷~的~，贫~差别，先~起来，农村~了 
W_E=rich 

G_E=adj  

S_E=PlusSentiment|正面评价 
E_E= 

DEF={rich|富} 
RMK= 

 

With the browser the user can retrieve all 

kinds of basic relations between concepts, such 

as synonym, hypernym, hyponym, etc. It should 

be noticed that these kinds of relations in How-

Net are not coded manually as the way as done 

in WordNet, but are computed on the basis of 

concept definitions. The browser can give all 

sorts of semantic roles for a given verb concept. 

To take “treat” as a given event, we retrieve all 

its “agents”, “locations”, “patients”, “instru-

ments”. This is regarded as the shallow rela-

tions between verb concepts and their relevant 

noun concepts. 

Particular attention should be given to our 

newly developed tool, HowNet Inference Pool 

(E/C bilingual). With the help of an activator of 

the tool we can build a senses pool for any con-

cept in HowNet. The pool covers all sorts of 

relationships under the key concept, for instance, 

when the concept of “money” as the key, it has 

a pool with 2600 concepts, including “bank”, 

“deposit”, “borrow”, “buy”, “steal”, etc. Hence 

55



suppose a question like “can we borrow money 

from a bank?” is raised to an inference machine, 

we are sure that the machine can give a correct 

answer with correct selection of meanings, like 

“bank” as “financial bank”. Moreover based on 

the inference machine we have developed a 

word sense disambiguation tool called HowNet 

SenseColony Tester (E/C bilingual). The tool is 

designed to be skilled in tackling the ambiguity 

of discourse type both in Chinese and English. 

The words “governor”, “state” in the following 

paragraph are so-called those of discourse-

ambiguity type: 

“We provided $250 in relief to more than 5 

million California seniors -- many whose life 

savings had taken a big hit in the financial crisis. 

And we provided emergency assistance to our 

governors to prevent teachers and police 

officers and firefighters from being laid off as a 

result of state budget shortfalls. At a time when 

California is facing a fiscal crisis, we know that 

this has saved the jobs of tens of thousands of 

educators and other needed public servants just 

in this state. And what was true in California 

was true all across the country.” 

The tool is language independent; it employs 

the data resources and the algorithm of the same 

type. 

HowNet English-Chinese MT system is a 

rule-based system. It uses HowNet basic data as 

its English-Chinese bilingual dictionary. It is 

powerful in its strongly semantic basis. The sys-

tem will surely have a bright future in its appli-

cation to PDA products and Chinese language 

learning aids. 

All the HowNet tools are not merely a demo 

of certain methodology, but are real applica-

tions that can be tested by users themselves.
