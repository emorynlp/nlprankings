Abstract

Korean is a morphologically rich language in
which grammatical functions are marked by
inflections and affixes, and they can indicate
grammatical relations such as subject, object,
predicate, etc. A Korean sentence could be
thought as a sequence of eojeols. An eo-
jeol is a word or its variant word form ag-
glutinated with grammatical affixes, and eo-
jeols are separated by white space as in En-
glish written texts. Korean treebanks (Choi
et al., 1994; Han et al., 2002; Korean Lan-
guage Institute, 2012) use eojeol as their fun-
damental unit of analysis, thus representing
an eojeol as a prepreterminal phrase inside
the constituent tree. This eojeol-based an-
notating schema introduces various complex-
ity to train the parser, for example an en-
tity represented by a sequence of nouns will
be annotated as two or more different noun
phrases, depending on the number of spaces
used. In this paper, we propose methods to
transform eojeol-based Korean treebanks into
entity-based Korean treebanks. The methods
are applied to Sejong treebank, which is the
largest constituent treebank in Korean, and the
transformed treebank is used to train and test
various probabilistic CFG parsers. The experi-
mental result shows that the proposed transfor-
mation methods reduce ambiguity in the train-
ing corpus, increasing the overall F1 score up
to about 9 %.

1 Introduction

The result of syntactic parsing is useful for many
NLP applications, such as named entity recogni-

tion (Finkel and Manning, 2009), semantic role la-
beling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), or sentimental
analysis (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003). Currently most
of the state-of-the-art constituent parsers take statis-
tical parsing approach (Klein and Manning, 2003;
Bikel, 2004; Petrov and Klein, 2007), which use
manually annotated syntactic trees to train the prob-
abilistic models of each consituents.

Even though there exist manually annotated Ko-
rean treebank corpora such as Sejong Treebank (Ko-
rean Language Institute, 2012), very few research
projects about the Korean parser, especially using
phrase structure grammars have been conducted. In
this paper, we aim to transform the treebank so that it
could be better used as training data for the already-
existing English constituent parsers.

Most of Korean treebank corpora use eojeols as
their fundamental unit of analysis. An eojeol is
a word or its variant word form agglutinated with
grammatical affixes, and eojeols are separated by
white space as in English written texts (Choi et al.,
2011). Figure 1 is one of the example constituent
tree from the Sejong Treebank. As can be observed,
an eojeol is always determined as a prepretermi-
nal phrase 1. But this kind of bracketing guideline
could cause ambiguities to the existing algorithms
for parsing English, because: (1) English does not
have the concept of “eojeol”, and (2) an eojeol
can contain two or more morphemes with different
grammatical roles. For example, Korean case par-

1A node is a prepreterminal if all the children of this node
are preterminals (Part-Of-Speech tags such as NNP and JKG).
Preterminal is defined to be a node with one child which is itself
a leaf (Damljanovic et al., 2010).

ticles (‘josa’) are normally written inside the same
eojeol with their argument nouns, but the whole eo-
jeol is always considered as a prepreterminal noun
phrase in the Korean treebank, as can be seen in the
eojeol Ungaro-GA. Considering that the case parti-
cles in Korean play important role in determining
the syntactic structure of a sentence, this could cause
loss of information during the training phase. More-
over, Emanuel Ungaro is considered as two different
noun phrases, because they simply belong to the two
different eojeols (that is, a space exists between eo-
jeols Emanuel and Ungaro-GA).

In this paper, we propose methods to refine the
Sejong treebank which is currently the largest Ko-
rean treebank corpus. The methods are aimed at de-
creasing the ambiguities during the training phase
of parsers, by separating phrases which are inte-
grated into the same prepreterminal phrase due to
the reason that they happen to be in the same eojeol,
and integrating phrases into the same prepretermi-
nal phrase which are separated because they hap-
pen to be in different eojeols. The refined datasets
are trained and tested against three state-of-the-art
parsers, and the evaluation results for each dataset
are reported.

In section 2, the work about Korean parsers are
briefly introduced. Sejong treebank is described

with more detailed explanation in section 3, while
the methods to transform the treebank are introduced
in section 4. In section 5 the evaluation results of the
transformed treebank using the three existing state-
of-the-art parsers are introduced with an error report,
and we discuss conclusions in section 6.

2 Related Work

There were some trials to build Korean constituent
parsers, but due to the lack of appropriate corpus
those trials were not able to acheive a good re-
sult. (Smith and Smith, 2004) tried to build a Ko-
rean parser by bilingual approach with English, and
achieved labeled precision/recall around 40 % for
Korean. More recently, (Park, 2006) tried to extract
tree adjoining grammars from the Sejong treebank,
and (Oh et al., 2011) build a system to predict a
phrase tag for each eojeol.

Due to the partial free word order and case pari-
cles which can decide the grammatical roles of noun
phrases, there exist some works to build statistical
dependency parsers for Korean. (Chung, 2004) pre-
sented a dependency parsing model using surface
contextual model. (Choi and Palmer, 2011) con-
verted the Sejong treebank into the dependency tree-
bank, and applied the SVM algorithm to learn the
dependency model.

Apart from the Sejong Treebank, there are few
other Korean treebanks available. The KAIST tree-
bank (Choi et al., 1994) contains constituent trees
about approximately 30K sentences from newspa-
pers, novels and textbooks. Also, the Penn Ko-
rean Treebank (Han et al., 2002) contains 15K
constituent trees constructed from the sentences of
newswire and military domains. The proposed
methods are evaluated using the Sejong treebank be-
cause it is the most recent and the largest Korean
treebank among those which is currently available.

3 Sejong Treebank

The Sejong treebank is the largest constituent
treebank in Korean. It contains approximately
45K manually-annotated constituent trees, and their
sources cover various domains including newspa-
pers, novels and cartoon texts. Figure 1 shows an
example of the Sejong constituent tree.

The tree consists of phrasal nodes and their func-
tional tags as described in table 2. Each eojeol
could contain one or more morphemes with different
POS tags (Table 1 shows the POS tagset). In most
cases, eojeols are determined by white spaces. As
stated in its bracketing guidelines, the Sejong tree-
bank uses eojeols as its fundamental unit of analy-
sis 2. This means that an eojeol is always treated as
one prepreterminal phrase. This could cause confu-
sions to the training system, because an eojeol could
contain many morphemes which have very different

jong project, but available only in Korean

grammatical roles, as can be seen in the example
of Ungaro-GA - word Ungaro is a noun, where the
nominative case particle GA suggests that this eojeol
is used as a subject.

Table 2 shows phrase tags and functional tags
used to construct the Sejong treebank. Some phrases
are annotated with functional tags to clarify their
grammatical role inside the sentence. There are
three special phrase tags beside those in table 2:
X indicates phrases containing only case particles
or ending markers, L and R indicate left and right
parenthesis.

4 Transforming Methods: from
Eojeol-based to Entity-based

In this section, we describe the methods to transform
the annotation schema of the Korean treebank from
eojeol-based to entity-based using the examples of
the Sejong treebank.

4.1 Method 1: POS Level Preprocessing
Before starting the actual transforming process, the
system first detects emails, phone numbers and dates

80



based on their unique POS patterns. If the system
detects a sequence of morphemes matching with one
of predefined POS patterns inside an eojeol, then it
groups those morphemes into one entity and tags it
as a noun. This procedure aims to reduce the ambi-
guity of the corpus by reducing many miscellaneous
mrophemes which in fact forms one phone num-
ber, email address or date information into one en-
tity. Figure 2 shows an example of an eojeol whose
five morphemes toghether represent one date, and its
transformation result.

Figure 2: Example of an eojeol containing date: five mor-
phemes are merged into one morpheme representing date.

Also, the morphemes representing chinese char-
acters (POS: SH) and other foreign characters (POS:
SL) are considered as nouns, since they are normally
used to rewrite Korean nouns that have their foreign
origin such as Sino-Korean nouns.

4.2 Method 2: Detecting NPs inside an Eojeol

Although an eojeol is considered to be one prepreter-
minal phrase as a whole, many eojeols contain sep-
arated noun components inside them. For exam-
ple, a noun phrase Ungaro-GA in Figure 3 con-
sists of a separated noun component Ungaro in it,
plus josa GA. The system separates noun compo-
nents from other endings and case particles, creates
a new phrase containing those words and tags it as
an NP. By doing so, the boundaries of the NP are
more clarified - before transforming prepreterminal
NPs could contain case particles and endings, but
after the transformation it is not possible. Also the
internal syntactic structures of phrases are revealed,
providing more information to the parser.

4.3 Method 3: Finding Arguments of Josa

In this step, the system tries to find out the actual ar-
gument of each josa. For example, in figure 4 the

Figure 3: Detecting NP inside an eojeol: Case of a verb
phrase

actual argument of the nominative josa GA is the
whole person name Emanuel Ungaro, not only Un-
garo. The system tries to find out the actual argu-
ment of each josa by using a rather simple heuristic:

1. Traverse the constituent parse tree in bottom-up, right-to-
left manner.

2. If a phrase node is NP, its parent is also NP, and it directly
dominates josa(s), then:

(a) Create a new NP.
(b) Attach the node to that NP, except the josa(s).
(c) Attach all the other children of the parent node to the

newly-created NP.
(d) Remove all the children of the parent, and attach the

new NP and remaining josa part to the parent node.

3. After the procedure ends, find and remove redundant NPs,
if exist.

Figure 4: Example of applying the transformation heuris-
tic

Method 3 is dependent on method 2, since method
2 first determines boundary of NPs which do not in-
clude any case particles.

4.4 Method 4: Integrating a Sequence of
Nouns into One NP

Some of entities represented as sequences of nouns
are considered as two or more separated noun

81



phrases since their components belong to the dif-
ferent eojeols. This could be problematic because
an entity could sometimes be written without any
whitespace between its component nouns. Figure 5
shows one of the case: person name Emanuel Un-
garo is considered as two separated NPs since there
exists a whitespace between a noun Emanual and a
noun Ungaro. In this step, we aim to solve this prob-
lem.

Figure 5: Integrating sequence of nouns representing one
entity into one prepreterminal noun phrase

The system finds out an NP which has two NP
children which dominates only the noun pretermi-
nal children. If the system finds such an NP, then it
removes NP children and attaches their children di-
rectly to the found NP. Figure 5 shows an application
example of the method.

This method is dependent on method 3, since this
method assumes that an NP with its parent also NP
does not have any case particles - which cannot be
hold if method 3 is not applied.

4.5 Method 5: Dealing with Noun
Conjunctions

The system tries to enumerate the noun conjunc-
tions, rather than expressing those conjunctions in
binary format. Current Sejong treebank expresses
noun conjunctions in binary format - that is, to ex-
press the constituent tree for noun conjunctions, the
nonterminal node has one NP child on its left which
contains information about the first item of the con-
junction, and the rest of conjunctions are expressed
on the right child. Figure 63 shows an example of
the Sejong constituent tree expressing the noun con-
junctions, and its transformed version.

Figure 6: Enumerating Noun Conjunctions

By converting noun conjunctions into rather the
‘enumerated’ forms, two benefits could be gained:
first, the resultant constituent tree will resemble
more to the Penn-treebank constituent trees. Since
most of the existing English parsers are trained on
the Penn Treebank, we can expect that the enumer-
ated form of conjunctions will more ‘fit’ to those
parsers. Second, the conjunctions are expressed in
much more explicit format, so the human users can
more easily understand the conjunctive structures in-
side the constituent trees.

4.6 Method 6: Re-tagging Phrase Tags

In this step, the system re-tags some of phrase tags
to clarify their types and to decrease training ambi-
guities. For example, a noun phrase with and with-
out case particles should be distinguished. The sys-
tem re-tags those noun phrases with case particles to
JSP 4 to distinguish them from the pure noun phrases
which consist of only nouns. Also, VP-MOD and
VNP-MOD are re-tagged to DP, since they have very
similar lexical formats with existing DPs. NP-MOD
is converted into JSP-MOD - most of them consist
of a NP with josa JKG, forming possesive cases. S-
MOD remains as S-MOD if its head is JSP-MOD:

4It stands for a ‘Josa Phrase’.

82



otherwise, it is also re-tagged to a DP. Figure 75

shows a re-tagging example.

Figure 7: Example of retagging phrase tags: VP-MOD to
DP, NP-MOD to JSP-MOD, and NP-SBJ to JSP-SBJ.

5 Evaluations

In this section, several experiment results using the
standard F1 metric (2PR/(P + R)) are introduced
to show the effect of each transforming method, and
the most frequently shown error cases are explained.

5.1 Experiments using the Sejong Treebank
The proposed transformation methods are applied to
the Sejong treebank, and the converted treebanks are
used to train and test three different well-known sta-
tistical parsers, namely Stanford parser (Klein and
Manning, 2003), Bikel-Collins parser (Bikel, 2012)
and Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006). To figure
out the effect of each method, all six methods are
sequentially applied one by one, and each version of
the treebank is used to train and test each parser. The
baseline treebank is the original Sejong treebank
without any transformations. For the Korean head
word extraction which will be used during parsing,
the head percolation rule of (Choi and Palmer, 2011)
is adapted. According to that paper, particles and
endings were the most useful morphemes to deter-
mine dependencies between eojeols. Based on the
observation, their rules are changed so that they give
the best priorities on those morphemes. We use
the preprocessing method described in (Park, 2006)
for training trees. It replaces symboles with Penn-
Treebank-like tags and corrects wrong morpheme

boundary marks within the eojeol. Methods are ap-
plied cumulatively; for example, symbol ‘M 1-6’
means the version of a treebank to which method
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are applied cumulatively.6

Table 3 shows the experimental results on each
version of the treebanks using each parser. Since
the corpus covers various domains (i.e. the style of
sentences is not homogeneous.), we perform 10-fold

resents Stanford parser, Bikel. represents Bikel-
Collins parser, and Berk. means Berkeley parser.
For the Berkeley parser, we set the number of itera-
tion as two for latent annotations. In this set of ex-
periments, only phrase tags are the target of training
and testing, not including functional tags.

As can be observed from the evaluation result, the
performance is improved due to methods 2 and 6
are quite big compared to the effect of other four

ity of transformations to be evaluated on the same trees for
meaning comparison.

methods. Especially, the performance increase due
to the method 6 strongly suggests that Sejong phrase
tagsets are not enough to distinguish the types of
phrases effectively. Except those two methods,
only the method 5 increases the overall performance
slightly, and methods 1, 3 and 4 do not have any
significant effect on the performance or even some-
times decrease the overall performance.

Although the usage of functional tags is different
from that of phrase tags, the Sejong treebank has
a very rich functional tag set. Considering the re-
sults of the previous experiments, it is highly likely
that some of phrasal information is encoded into the
functional tags. To prove that, another set of experi-
ments is carried out. In this time, parsers are trained
not only on phrase tags but also on functional tags.
Table 4 shows the evaluation results.

As can be observed, by keeping functional tags
to train and test parsers, the baseline performance
increases 3 to 6 % for the Stanford and Berkeley
parsers. Only the performance of the Bikel parser

is decreased - it is highly possible that the parser
fails to find out the appropriate head word for each
possible tag, because the number of possible tags is
increased greatly by using the functional tags along
with the phrase tags.

In both set of experiments, the method 3 decreases
the overall performance. This strongly suggests that
finding the actual argument of josa directly is quite a
challenging work. The performance drop is consid-
ered mainly because the branching problem at the
higher level of the constituent tree is counted twice
due to the josa.

5.2 Experiments using the Penn Korean
Treebank

To show the effect of the transformation methods
more clearly, the Penn Korean Treebank (Han et al.,
2002) is used as another treebank for experimen-
tation: (Chung et al., 2010) describes about major
difficulties of parsing Penn Korean Treebank. The
same three parsers are trained and tested using the
treebank. Due to the different annotation guidelines
and different tagsets, transformation methods 1, 5
and 6 cannot be applied on the treebank. Thus, only
method 2, 3 and 4 are used to transform the treebank.
Table 5 shows the evaluation results.

Table 5: Evaluation on Penn Korean Treebank.

The overall performance of training the Penn Ko-
rean treebank is higher than that of the Sejong tree-
bank. There could be two possible explanations.
First one is, since the Penn Korean treebank tries
to follow English Penn treebank guidelines as much

84



as possible, thus annotation guidelines of the Ko-
rean Penn treebank could be much “familiar” to the
parsers than that of the Sejong treebank. The second
explanation is, since the domain of the Penn Korean
treebank is much more restricted than that of the Se-
jong treebank, the system could be trained for the
specific domain. The best performance was gained
with the Stanford parser, with the treebank trans-
formed by method 2. Actually, (Chung et al., 2010)
also investigated parsing accuracy on the Penn Ko-
rean treebank; the direct comparison could be very
difficult because parsing criteria is different.

5.3 Error Analysis

In this section, some of the parsing error cases are
reported. Berkeley parser trained with the Sejong
treebank is used for error analysis. Both phrase tags
and functional tags are used to train and test the sys-
tem.

5.3.1 Locating Approximate Positions of
Errors

As the first step to analyze the errors, we tried to
figure out at which points of the constituent tree er-
rors frequently occur – do the errors mainly occur at
the bottom of the trees? Or at the top of the trees?
If we can figure out approximate locations of errors,
then the types of errors could be predicted.

Figure 8: Example of assigning levels to each phrasal
node.

To define the level of each nonterminal node of
the constituent tree, the following rules are used:

• The level of prepreterminal node is 0.

• The levels of other phrasal nodes are defined
as: the maximal level of their children + 1.

• Once the levels of all the phrasal nodes are cal-
culated, normalize the levels so that they have
the values between 0 and 1.

Figure 8 shows an example of constituent tree
with levels assigned to its phrasal nodes. All the
prepreterminal nodes have level value 0, and the top-
most node has level 1.

Figure 9: Performance of the system on each level of the
parse tree

Once the levels are assigned to each constituent
tree, only those constituents with levels larger than
or equal to the predefined threshold µ are used to
evaluate the system. µ are increased from 0 to 1 with
value 0.01. Higher µ value means that the system is
evaluated only for those constituents positioned at
the top level of the constituent tree.

Figure 9 shows the evaluation results. X-axis rep-
resents the value of µ, and Y-axis represents the F1-
score. As can be observed, most of the errors oc-
cur at the mid-level of the constituent trees. Also,
the effects of some methods are explicitly shown
on the graph. For example, method 2 greatly in-
creases the performance at low level of the con-
stituent tree, suggesting improved consistency in de-
temining prepreterminal NP nodes. Also, it is shown
that the proposed methods does not affect the perfor-
mance of mid-level and top-level constituent deci-
sions - this suggests that the future works should be
more focused on providing more information about
those mid-level decision to the treebank annotation.

method 4 tries to find and gather the sequence of
nouns which actually belong to one NP, it misses
some of the cases. Figure 10 shows such example.
Some parts of the tree are omitted using the notation
‘...’ to show the example more simply. Although it
is counted as the parser error, the result of the parser
is more likely to be an answer - the number of those
products is 8, not their action. The Sejong treebank
tree is annotated in that way because the number ‘8’
and bound noun Gae (‘unit’), representing as units,
are separated by a space. To detect such kind of sep-
arated NPs and transform them into one NP will be
our next task.

Finding an Appropriate Modifee. Some phrases
modifying other phrases were failed to find their ap-
propriate modifees. Figure 11 shows an example of
such kind of error case.

Detecting an Appropriate Subject of the Sen-
tence. This case frequently occurs when a sentence
is quotated inside the other sentence. In this case,
the subject of quotated sentence is often considered
as the subject of the whole sentence, because the
quotated sentences in Korean are usually first stated

Figure 11: Example of a phrase (JSP-AJT) which failed
to find its right modifee.

and then the subject of the whole sentence shows up.
Figure 12 shows an example of the erroneously de-
tected subject.

The Wrongly-tagged Topmost Node. Some of
Sejong treebank trees have phrases which are not
tagged as S as their topmost nodes. This could cause
confusion during the training. Figure 13 shows such
example.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

Although there exist some manually-annotated
large-enough constituent treebanks such as Sejong
treebank, it was hard to apply the algorithms for En-
glish parsers to Korean treebanks, because they were
annotated in eojeol-based scheme, which concept
does not exist in English. In this paper, we showed
the possibility of acquiring good training and testing
results with the existing parsers trained using the ex-
isting Korean treebanks, if it undergoes some simple
transforming procedures. The error analysis result
shows that, indeed the proposed method improves
the performance of parser at the lower level of con-
stituent tree.

Although there exists a performance gain due to
the transforming methods, there are still many gaps
for improvement. The evaluation results and er-
ror analysis results suggests the need to define the
phrase tagset of Sejong treebank in more detail.
Also, the transforming methods themselves are not
perfect yet - we believe still they could be improved
more to increase consistency of the resultant tree-
banks.

We will continuously develop our transforming
methods to improve the parsing result. Furthermore,
we are planning to investigate methods to determine
the appropriate “detailedness” of phrase tag set, so
that there are no missing information due to too
small number of tags as well as no confusion due
to too many tags.
