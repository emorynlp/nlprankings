Abstract

Since paraphrasing is one of the crucial tasks
in natural language understanding and gener-
ation, this paper introduces a novel technique
to extract paraphrases for emotion terms, from
non-parallel corpora. We present a bootstrap-
ping technique for identifying paraphrases,
starting with a small number of seeds. Word-
Net Affect emotion words are used as seeds.
The bootstrapping approach learns extraction
patterns for six classes of emotions. We use
annotated blogs and other datasets as texts
from which to extract paraphrases, based on
the highest-scoring extraction patterns. The
results include lexical and morpho-syntactic
paraphrases, that we evaluate with human
judges.

1 Introduction

Paraphrases are different ways to express the same
information. Algorithms to extract and automati-
cally identify paraphrases are of interest from both
linguistic and practical points of view. Many ma-
jor challenges in Natural Language Processing ap-
plications, for example multi-document summariza-
tion, need to avoid repetitive information from the
input documents. In Natural Language Genera-
tion, paraphrasing is employed to create more var-
ied and natural text. In our research, we ex-
tract paraphrases for emotions, with the goal of us-
ing them to automatically-generate emotional texts
(such as friendly or hostile texts) for conversations
between intelligent agents and characters in educa-
tional games. Paraphrasing is applied to generate
text with more variety. To our knowledge, most cur-
rent applications manually collect paraphrases for

specific applications, or they use lexical resources
such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) to identify
paraphrases.

This paper introduces a novel method for ex-
tracting paraphrases for emotions from texts. We
focus on the six basic emotions proposed by Ek-
man (1992): happiness, sadness, anger, disgust,
surprise, and fear.

We describe the construction of the paraphrases
extractor. We also propose a k-window algorithm
for selecting contexts that are used in the paraphrase
extraction method. We automatically learn patterns
that are able to extract the emotion paraphrases from
corpora, starting with a set of seed words. We use
data sets such as blogs and other annotated cor-
pora, in which the emotions are marked. We use
a large collection of non-parallel corpora which are
described in Section 3. These corpora contain many
instances of paraphrases different words to express
the same emotion.

An example of sentence fragments for one
emotion class, happiness, is shown in Table 1. From
them, the paraphrase pair that our method will
extract is:
"so happy to see"
"very glad to visit".

In the following sections, we give an overview of
related work on paraphrasing in Section 2. In Sec-
tion 3 we describe the datasets used in this work.
We explain the details of our paraphrase extraction
method in Section 4. We present results of our evalu-
ation and discuss our results in Section 5, and finally
in Section 6 we present the conclusions and future
work.

2 Related Work

Three main approaches for collecting paraphrases
were proposed in the literature: manual collection,
utilization of existing lexical resources, and corpus-
based extraction of expressions that occur in similar
contexts (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001). Manually-
collected paraphrases were used in natural language
generation (NLG) (Iordanskaja et al., 1991). Langk-
ilde et al. (1998) used lexical resources in statistical
sentence generation, summarization, and question-
answering. Barzilay and McKeown (2001) used a
corpus-based method to identify paraphrases from a
corpus of multiple English translations of the same
source text. Our method is similar to this method,
but it extracts paraphrases only for a particular emo-
tion, and it needs only a regular corpus, not a parallel
corpus of multiple translations.

Some research has been done in paraphrase ex-
traction for natural language processing and genera-
tion for different applications. Das and Smith (2009)
presented a approach to decide whether two sen-
tences hold a paraphrase relationship. They ap-
plied a generative model that generates a paraphrase
of a given sentence, then used probabilistic infer-
ence to reason about whether two sentences share
the paraphrase relationship. In another research,
Wang et. al (2009) studied the problem of extract-
ing technical paraphrases from a parallel software
corpus. Their aim was to report duplicate bugs. In
their method for paraphrase extraction, they used:
sentence selection, global context-based and co-
occurrence-based scoring. Also, some studies have
been done in paraphrase generation in NLG (Zhao
et al., 2009), (Chevelu et al., 2009). Bootstrapping
methods have been applied to various natural lan-
guage applications, for example to word sense dis-
ambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), lexicon construction
for information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999),
and named entity classification (Collins and Singer,
1999). In our research, we use the bootstrapping ap-
proach to learn paraphrases for emotions.

3 Data

The text data from which we will extract paraphrases
is composed of four concatenated datasets. They
contain sentences annotated with the six basic emo-
tions. The number of sentences in each dataset
is presented in Table 2. We briefly describe the
datasets, as follows.

3.1 LiveJournal blog dataset

We used the blog corpus that Mishne collected for
his research (Mishne, 2005). The corpus contains
815,494 blog posts from Livejournal 1, a free we-
blog service used by millions of people to create
weblogs. In Livejournal, users are able to option-
ally specify their current emotion or mood. To se-
lect their emotion/mood users can choose from a list
of 132 provided moods. So, the data is annotated
by the user who created the blog. We selected only
the texts corresponding to the six emotions that we
mentioned.

3.2 Text Affect Dataset

This dataset (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) con-
sists of newspaper headlines that were used in the
SemEval 2007-Task 14. It includes a development
dataset of 250 annotated headlines, and a test dataset
of 1000 news headlines. We use all of them. The an-
notations were made with the six basic emotions on
intensity scales of [-100, 100], therefore a threshold
is used to choose the main emotion of each sentence.

3.3 Fairy Tales Dataset

This dataset consists in 1580 annotated sentences
(Alm et al., 2005), from tales by the Grimm brothers,
H.C. Andersen, and B. Potter. The annotations used
the extended set of nine basic emotions of Izard
(1971). We selected only those marked with the six
emotions that we focus on.

3.4 Annotated Blog Dataset

We also used the dataset provided by Aman and Sz-
pakowicz (2007). Emotion-rich sentences were se-
lected from personal blogs, and annotated with the
six emotions (as well as a non-emotion class, that
we ignore here). They worked with blog posts and
collected directly from the Web. First, they prepared

a list of seed words for six basic emotion categories
proposed by Ekman (1992). Then, they took words
commonly used in the context of a particular emo-
tion. Finally, they used the seed words for each
category, and retrieved blog posts containing one or
more of those words for the annotation process.

4 Method for Paraphrase Extraction

For each of the six emotions, we run our method
on the set of sentences marked with the correspond-
ing emotion from the concatenated corpus. We
start with a set of seed words form WordNet Af-
fect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), for each emo-
tion of interest. The number of seed words is the fol-
lowing: for happiness 395, for surprise 68, for fear
140, for disgust 50, for anger 250, and for sadness
200. Table 3 shows some of seeds for each category
of emotion.

Since sentences are different in our datasets
and they are not aligned as parallel sentences as
in (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001), our algorithm
constructs pairs of similar sentences, based on the
local context. On the other hand, we assume that,

if the contexts surrounding two seeds look similar,
then these contexts are likely to help in extracting
new paraphrases.

Figure 1 illustrates the high-level architecture of
our paraphrase extraction method. The input to the
method is a text corpus for a emotion category and
a manually defined list of seed words. Before boot-
strapping starts, we run the k-window algorithm on
every sentence in the corpus, in order to construct
candidate contexts. In Section 4.5 we explain how
the bootstrapping algorithm processes and selects
the paraphrases based on strong surrounding con-
texts. As it is shown in Figure 1, our method has
several stages: extracting candidate contexts, using
them to extract patterns, selecting the best patterns,
extracting potential paraphrases, and filtering them
to obtain the final paraphrases.

4.1 Preprocessing

During preprocessing, HTML and XML tags are
eliminated from the blogs data and other datasets,
then the text is tokenized and annotated with part
of speech tags. We use the Stanford part-of-speech
tagger and chunker (Toutanova et al., 2003) to iden-
tify noun and verb phrases in the sentences. In the
next step, we use a sliding window based on the
k-window approach, to identify candidate contexts
that contain the target seeds.

4.2 The k-window Algorithm

We use the k-window algorithm introduced by
Bostad (2003) in order to identify all the tokens
surrounding a specific term in a window with
size of ±k. Here, we use this approach to ex-
tract candidate patterns for each seed, from the
sentences. We start with one seed and truncate
all contexts around the seed within a window of
±k words before and ±k words after the seed,
until all the seeds are processed. For these exper-
iments, we set the value of k to ±5. Therefore

the longest candidate contexts will have the form
w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, seed, w6, w7, w8, w9, w10, w11.
In the next subsection, we explain what features we
extract from each candidate context, to allow us to
determine similar contexts.

4.3 Feature Extraction
Previous research on word sense disambiguation on
contextual analysis has acknowledged several local
and topical features as good indicators of word prop-
erties. These include surrounding words and their
part of speech tags, collocations, keywords in con-
texts (Mihalcea, 2004). Also recently, other fea-
tures have been proposed: bigrams, named entities,
syntactic features, and semantic relations with other
words in the context.

We transfer the candidate phrases extracted by the
sliding k-window into the vector space of features.
We consider features that include both lexical and
syntactic descriptions of the paraphrases for all pairs
of two candidates. The lexical features include the
sequence of tokens for each phrase in the paraphrase
pair; the syntactic feature consists of a sequence of
part-of-speech (PoS) tags where equal words and
words with the same root and PoS are marked.
For example, the value of the syntactic feature for
the pair ‘‘so glad to see’’ and ‘‘very
happy to visit’’ is “RB1 JJ1 TO V B1”
and ”RB1 JJ2 TO V B2”, where indices indicate

Candidate context: He was further annoyed by the jay bird
’PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT NN NN’,65,8,’VBD RB’,?,was,
?,?,?,He/PRP,was/VBD,further/RB,annoyed,by/IN,the/DT,
jay/NN,bird/NN,?,?,jay,?,’IN DT NN’,2,2,0,1

word equalities. However, based on the above ev-
idences and our previous research, we also investi-
gate other features that are well suited for our goal.
Table 5 lists the features that we used for paraphrase
extraction. They include some term frequency fea-
tures. As an example, in Table 4 we show extracted
features from a relevant context.

4.4 Extracting Patterns

From each candidate context, we extracted the fea-
tures as described above. Then we learn extraction
patterns, in which some words might be substituted
by their part-of-speech. We use the seeds to build
initial patterns. Two candidate contexts that con-
tain the same seed create one positive example. By
using each initial seed, we can extract all contexts
surrounding these positive examples. Then we se-
lect the stronger ones. We used Collins and Singer
method (Collins and Singer, 1999) to compute the
strength of each example. If we consider x as a con-
text, the strength as a positive example of x is de-

38



Features Description
F1 Sequence of part-of-speech
F2 Length of sequence in bytes
F3 Number of tokens
F4 Sequence of PoS between the seed and the first verb before the seed
F5 Sequence of PoS between the seed and the first noun before the seed
F6 First verb before the seed
F7 First noun before the seed
F8 Token before the seed
F9 Seed
F10 Token after the seed
F11 First verb after the seed
F12 First noun after the seed
F13 Sequence of PoS between the seed and the first verb after the seed
F14 Sequence of PoS between the seed and the first noun after the seed
F15 Number of verbs in the candidate context
F16 Number of nouns in the candidate context
F17 Number of adjective in the candidate context
F18 Number of adverbs in the candidate context

fined as:

Strength(x) = count(x+)/count(x) (1)

In Equation 1, count(x+) is the number of times
context x surrounded a seed in a positive example
and count(x) is frequency of the context x. This
allows us to score the potential pattern.

4.5 Bootstrapping Algorithm for Paraphrase
Extraction

Our bootstrapping algorithm is summarized in Fig-
ure 2. It starts with a set of seeds, which are consid-
ered initial paraphrases. A set of extraction patterns
is initially empty. The algorithm generates candidate
contexts, from the aligned similar contexts. The can-
didate patterns are scored by how many paraphrases
they can extract. Those with the highest scores are
added to the set of extraction patterns. Using the ex-
tended set of extraction patterns, more paraphrase
pairs are extracted and added to the set of para-
phrases. Using the enlarged set of paraphrases, more
extraction patterns are extracted. The process keeps
iterating until no new patterns or no new paraphrases
are learned.

Our method is able to accumulate a large lexi-
con of emotion phrases by bootstrapping from the
manually initialized list of seed words. In each it-
eration, the paraphrase set is expanded with related
phrases found in the corpus, which are filtered by
using a measure of strong surrounding context sim-
ilarity. The bootstrapping process starts by select-
ing a subset of the extraction patterns that aim to
extract the paraphrases. We call this set the pattern
pool. The phrases extracted by these patterns be-
come candidate paraphrases. They are filtered based
on how many patterns select them, in order to pro-
duce the final paraphrases from the set of candidate
paraphrases.

5 Results and Evaluation

The result of our algorithm is a set of extraction pat-
terns and a set of pairs of paraphrases. Some of the
paraphrases extracted by our system are shown in
Table 6. The paraphrases that are considered correct
are shown under Correct paraphrases. As explained
in the next section, two human judges agreed that
these are acceptable paraphrases. The results con-
sidered incorrect by the two judges are shown un-

extraction patterns and produced 5926 pairs of para-
phrases. Table 7 shows the number of extraction pat-
terns and the number of paraphrase pairs that were
produced by our algorithm for each class of emo-
tions. For evaluation of our algorithm, we use two
techniques. One uses human judges to judge if a
sample of paraphrases extracted by our method are
correct; we also measures the agreement between
the judges (See Section 5.1). The second estimates
the recall and the precision of our method (See Sec-
tion 5.2. In the following subsections we describe
these evaluations.

5.1 Evaluating Correctness with Human
Judges

We evaluate the correctness of the extracted para-
phrase pairs, using the same method as Brazilay and
McKeown (2001). We randomly selected 600 para-
phrase pairs from the lexical paraphrases produced
by our algorithm: for each class of emotion we
selected 100 paraphrase pairs. We evaluated their
correctness with two human judges. They judged
whether the two expressions are good paraphrases
or not.

We provided a page of guidelines for the judges.
We defined paraphrase as ”approximate conceptual
equivalence”, the same definition used in (Barzilay
and McKeown, 2001). Each human judge had to
choose a ”Yes” or ”No” answer for each pair of para-
phrases under test. We did not include example sen-
tences containing these paraphrases. A similar Ma-
chine Translation evaluation task for word-to-word
translation was done in (Melamed, 2001).

Figure 3 presents the results of the evaluation: the
correctness for each class of emotion according to
judge A, and according to judge B. The judges were
graduate students in computational linguistics, na-

tive speakers of English.
We also measured the agreement between the two

judges and the Kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castel-
lan, 1988). If there is complete agreement between
two judges Kappa is 1, and if there is no agreement
between the judges then Kappa = 0. The Kappa
values and the agreement values for our judges are
presented in Figure 4.

The inter-judge agreement over all the para-
phrases for the six classes of emotions is 81.72%,
which is 490 out of the 600 paraphrases pairs in our
sample. Note that they agreed that some pairs are
good paraphrases, or they agreed that some pairs
are not good paraphrases, that is why the numbers
in Figure 4 are higher than the correctness numbers
from Figure 3. The Kappa coefficient compensates
for the chance agreement. The Kappa value over
all the paraphrase pairs is 74.41% which shows a
significant agreement.

Figure 3: The correctness results according the judge A
and judge B, for each class of emotion.

5.2 Estimating Recall

Evaluating the Recall of our algorithm is difficult
due to following reasons. Our algorithm is not able
to cover all the English words; it can only detect

paraphrasing relations with words which appeared
in our corpus. Moreover, to compare directly with
an electronic thesaurus such as WordNet is not fea-
sible, because WordNet contains mostly synonym
sets between words, and only a few multi-word ex-
pressions. We decided to estimate recall manually,
by asking a human judge to extract paraphrases by
hand from a sample of text. We randomly selected
60 texts (10 for each emotion class) and asked the
judge to extract paraphrases from these sentences.
For each emotion class, the judge extracted expres-
sions that reflect the emotion, and then made pairs
that were conceptually equivalent. It was not feasi-
ble to ask a second judge to do the same task, be-
cause the process is time-consuming and tedious.

In Information Retrieval, Precision and Recall are
defined in terms of a set of retrieved documents and
a set of relevant documents 2. In the following sec-
tions we describe how we compute the Precision and
Recall for our algorithm compared to the manually

extracted paraphrases.
From the paraphrases that were extracted by the

algorithm from the same texts, we counted how
many of them were also extracted by the human
judge. Equation 2 defines the Precision. On av-
erage, from 89 paraphrases extracted by the algo-
rithm, 74 were identified as paraphrases by the hu-
man judge (84.23%). See Table 8 for the values for
all the classes.

5.3 Discussion and Comparison to Related
Work

To the best of our knowledge, no similar research
has been done in extracting paraphrases for emotion
terms from corpora. However, Barzilay and McKe-
own (2001) did similar work to corpus-based iden-

42



tification of general paraphrases from multiple En-
glish translations of the same source text. We can
compare the pros and cons of our method compared
to their method. The advantages are:

• In our method, there is no requirement for the
corpus to be parallel. Our algorithm uses the
entire corpus together to construct its boot-
strapping method, while in (Barzilay and McK-
eown, 2001) the parallel corpus is needed in or-
der detect positive contexts.

• Since we construct the candidate contexts
based on the k-window approach, there is no
need for sentences to be aligned in our method.
In (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) sentence
alignment is essential in order to recognize
identical words and positive contexts.

• The algorithm in (Barzilay and McKeown,
2001) has to find positive contexts first, then
it looks for appropriate patterns to extract para-
phrases. Therefore, if identical words do not
occur in the aligned sentences, the algorithm
fails to find positive contexts. But, our al-
gorithm starts with given seeds that allow us
to detect positive context with the k-window
method.

A limitation of our method is the need for the initial
seed words. However, obtaining these seed words
is not a problem nowadays. They can be found in
on line dictionaries, WordNet, and other lexical re-
courses.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we introduced a method for corpus-
based extraction of paraphrases for emotion terms.
We showed a method that used a bootstrapping tech-
nique based on contextual and lexical features and
is able to successfully extract paraphrases using a
non-parallel corpus. We showed that a bootstrapping
algorithm based on contextual surrounding context
features of paraphrases achieves significant perfor-
mance on our data set.

In future work, we will extend this techniques to
extract paraphrases from more corpora and for more
types of emotions. In terms of evaluation, we will
use the extracted paraphrases as features in machine

learning classifiers that classify candidate sentences
into classes of emotions. If the results of the classifi-
cation are good, this mean the extracted paraphrases
are of good quality.
