Abstract

We consider the task of named entity
recognition for Chinese social media. The
long line of work in Chinese NER has fo-
cused on formal domains, and NER for
social media has been largely restricted
to English. We present a new corpus of
Weibo messages annotated for both name
and nominal mentions. Additionally, we
evaluate three types of neural embeddings
for representing Chinese text. Finally, we
propose a joint training objective for the
embeddings that makes use of both (NER)
labeled and unlabeled raw text. Our meth-
ods yield a 9% improvement over a state-
of-the-art baseline.

1 Introduction

Named entity recognition (NER), and more gen-
erally the task of mention detection1, is an essen-
tial component of information extraction technolo-
gies: the first step before tasks such as relation
extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) and en-
tity linking (Dredze et al., 2010; Ratinov et al.,
2011). A long line of work has focused on NER
in both formal and informal domains (Collins and
Singer, 1999; McCallum and Li, 2003; Nadeau
and Sekine, 2007; Jin and Chen, 2008; He et al.,
2012a), with recent efforts turning towards social
media (Finin et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Ritter et
al., 2011; Fromreide et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012;
Liu et al., 2012). While NER has included work
on several languages, work on social media NER
has largely focused on English language data.2

We consider NER on Chinese social media from
the popular Sina Weibo service, both because of

1Since we consider name and nominals, our work is closer
to mention detection. For simplicity, we use the term NER.

quite similar to English from the standpoint of building mod-
els and features.

the popularity of the service (comparable in size
to Twitter and previously used in NLP research
(Ling et al., 2013)) and the challenges faced in
processing Chinese language data. One approach
is to utilize lexical embeddings to improve NER
systems (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et
al., 2010; Passos et al., 2014), including for Twit-
ter (Cherry and Guo, 2015). However, the use
of embeddings for Chinese remains a challenge.
Unlike most languages, we cannot easily assign
an embedding to each Chinese word without au-
tomated segmentation, which may be unreliable,
especially when we want to model informal text.3

For this reason, state-of-the-art NER systems for
Chinese do not tag words; they instead tag charac-
ters directly (Mao et al., 2008). While work has
explored different embeddings for Chinese (Liu et
al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2014; Chen
et al., 2015), their inclusion in downstream tasks,
such as NER, remains untested.

We explore several types of embeddings for
Chinese text and their effect on Chinese social
media NER. Specifically, we make the following
contributions. 1) We present the first system for
NER on Chinese social media using a new cor-
pus based on Weibo messages. We consider both
name and nominal mentions, with the goal of sup-
porting downstream systems, such as coreference
resolution. Notably, our results reveal that the gap
between social media and traditional text for Chi-
nese is much larger than similar corpora for En-
glish, suggesting this task as an interesting area
of future work.4 2) We evaluate three types of
embeddings for Chinese text based on their inclu-
sion in a downstream task. We include results with
and without fine-tuning. 3) We present a joint ob-

3Word segmentation performance is much worse on social
media compared to formal text (Duan et al., 2012).

4Consider the overall F1 scores from Ritter et al. (2011),
Cherry and Guo (2015) and Fromreide et al. (2014) compared
to our best results in Table 2. This is despite the fact that Chi-
nese NER performance on formal texts is similar to English.

jective that trains embeddings simultaneously for
both NER and language modeling. Joint training
yields better results than post-hoc fine-tuning.

2 NER for Chinese Social Media

Several SIGHAN shared tasks have focused on
Chinese NER (Zhang et al., 2006; Jin and Chen,
2008; He et al., 2012b; Zhu et al., 2003; Fang et
al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006), though they have
been restricted to formal text, e.g. news. NER for
Chinese social media remains unexplored.5

As is the case for other languages, social me-
dia informality introduces numerous problems
for NLP systems, such as spelling errors, novel
words, and ungrammatical constructions. Chinese
presents additional challenges, since it uses lo-
gograms instead of alphabets, and lacks many of
the clues that a word is a name, e.g. capitaliza-
tion and punctuation marks. The lack of explicit
word boundaries further confuses NER systems.
These problems are worse in social media, which
has worse word segmentation. Additionally, typi-
cal Chinese corpora use exclusively traditional or
simplified characters, whereas social media mixes
them. Figure 1 demonstrates some challenges.

The baseline system for our task is our own
implementation of Mao et al. (2008), which is
the current state-of-the-art on the SIGHAN 2008
shared task (Jin and Chen, 2008). They use a CRF
tagger with a BIOSE (begin, inside, outside, sin-
gleton, end) encoding that tags individual charac-
ters, not words, since word segmentation errors
are especially problematic for NER (Zhang et al.,
2006). Features include many common English
NER features, e.g. character unigrams and bi-
grams, with context windows of size 5. See Mao
et al. (2008) for complete details on their system.

Mao et al. (2008) use a two pass approach, train-
ing a CRF first for mention detection and using
the resulting predictions as a feature for an NER
system. Furthermore, they make extensive use
of gazetteer features. For simplicity, we exclude
the first pass mention detection and the gazetteer
features, which make only small improvements to
their overall performance. We note that other im-
plementations of this system (Zhang et al., 2013)
have been unable to match the performance re-
ported in Mao et al. (2008). Similarly, our imple-
mentation yields results on SIGHAN 2008 similar

5Yang et al. (2014) consider a related problem of identi-
fying product mentions in Weibo messages.

to those reported in Zhang et al. (2013).6 Overall,
we take this tagger as representative of state-of-
the-art for Chinese NER.

3 Embeddings for Chinese Text

Lexical embeddings represent words in a continu-
ous low dimensional space, which can capture se-
mantic or syntactic properties of the lexicon: sim-
ilar words would have similar low dimensional
vector representations. Embeddings have been
used to gain improvements in a variety of NLP
tasks. In NER specifically, several papers have
shown improvements by using pre-trained neu-
ral embeddings as features in standard NER sys-
tems (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al.,
2010; Passos et al., 2014). More recently, these
improvements have been demonstrated on Twitter
data (Cherry and Guo, 2015). Embeddings are es-
pecially helpful when there is little training data,
since they can be trained on a large amount of un-
labeled data. This is the case for new languages
and domains, the task we face in this paper.

However, training embeddings for Chinese is
not straightforward: Chinese is not word seg-
mented, so embeddings for each word cannot be
trained on a raw corpus. Additionally, the state-
of-the-art systems for downstream Chinese tasks,
such as NER, may not use words.

We present three types of Chinese embeddings
that will be trained on a large corpus of Weibo
messages. These embeddings will be used as fea-
tures in the NER system by adding a (real valued)
feature for each dimension of the embedding for
the current word/character.

Word Embeddings We train an embedding for
each word type, the standard approach in other
languages. We run a Chinese word segmentation

system7 over the raw corpus of Weibo messages.
To create features, we first segment the NER data,
and then lookup the embedding that matches the
segmented word. Since the NER system tags char-
acters, we add the same word embedding features
to each character in the word.

Character Embeddings We learn an embed-
ding for each character in the training corpus (Sun
et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014).This removes the de-
pendency on pre-processing the text, and better fits
our intended use case: NER tagging over charac-
ters. Since there are many fewer characters than
words, we learn many fewer embeddings. On the
one hand, this means fewer parameters and less
over-fitting. However, the reduction in parameters
comes with a loss of specificity, where we may
be unable to learn different behaviors of a charac-
ter in different settings. We explore a compromise
approach in the next section. These embeddings
are directly incorporated into the NER system by
adding embedding features for each character.

Character and Position Embeddings Charac-
ter embeddings cannot distinguish between uses of
the same character in different contexts, whereas
word embeddings fail to make use of characters
or character n-grams that are part of many words.
A compromise is to use character embeddings that
are sensitive to the character’s position in the word
(Chen et al., 2015). We first word segment the
corpus. For each character in each word, we add
a positional tag, e.g. the first/second/etc. charac-
ter in the word, yielding multiple embeddings per
character. We learn separate embeddings for each
positionally tagged character. To use these embed-
dings as features, we segment the NER text, obtain
position tags for each character, and add features
for the corresponding embedding.

These three methods lead to 179,809 word
embeddings, 10,912 character embeddings, and
24,818 character with position embeddings.

3.1 Fine Tuning

For each of the embeddings, we fine-tune pre-
trained embeddings in the context of the NER task.
This corresponds to initializing the embeddings
parameters using a pre-trained model, and then
modifying the parameters during gradient updates
of the NER model by back-propogating gradients.

7We use Jieba for segmentation: https://github.
com/fxsjy/jieba

This is a standard method that has been previously
explored in sequential and structured prediction
problem (Collobert et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013;
Yao et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2014).

3.2 Joint Training Objectives

Fine-tuning has a disadvantage: it can arbitrar-
ily deviate from the settings obtained from train-
ing on large amounts of raw text. Recent work
has instead tuned embeddings for a specific task,
while maintaining information learned from raw
text. Yu and Dredze (2014) use multi-part objec-
tives that include both standard unlabeled objec-
tives, such as skip-gram models in word2vec, and
task specific objectives. Jointly training the em-
beddings with the multi-part objectives allows the
fine-tuned embeddings to further influence other
embeddings, even those that do not appear in the
labeled training data. This type of training can
help improve OOVs (Yu and Dredze, 2015), an
important aspect of improving social media NER.

We propose to jointly learn embeddings for both
language models and the NER task. The modified
objective function (log-likelihood) for the CRF is
given by:

Ls(λ, ew)

=
1
K

∑
k

log 1
Z(x)k

+
∑

j

λjFj(yk,xk, ew)

 ,

where K is the number of instances, λ is the
weight vector, xk and yk are the words and la-
bels sequence for each instance, ew is the embed-
ding for a word/character/character-position rep-
resentation w, Z(x)k is the normalization fac-
tor for each instance, and Fj(yk,xk, ew) =∑n

i=1 fj(y
k
i−1, y

k
i ,x

k, ew, i) represents the fea-
ture function in which j denotes different feature
templates and i denotes the position index in a
sentence. This differs from a traditional CRF in
that the feature function depends on the additional
variables ew, which are the embeddings (as de-
fined above). As a result, the objective is no longer
log-linear, but log-bilinear 8.

8It is log-bilinear because the log-likelihood takes the
form f(x, y) = axy + bx + cy, where x, y are variables and
a, b, c are coefficients. In this case, x is the feature weight
and y is the embedding; both of them are vectors. Taking the
partial derivative with respect to any one of the variables, one
gets a constant (wrt that variable). This satisfies the definition
of log-bilinear functions.

The second term is the standard skip-gram lan-
guage model objective (Mikolov et al., 2013):

Lu(ew) = 1
T

T∑
t=1

∑
−c≤j≤c,j 6=0

log p(wt+j |wt), (1)

where

p(wi|wj) =
exp

(
eTwiewj

)
∑

i′ exp
(
eTwi′ewj

) .
The first objective is notated Ls for “super-

vised” (trained on labeled NER data), and the sec-
ond is Lu, “unsupervised” (trained on raw text.)
Both objectives share the same variables ew. The
overall goal is to maximize their weighted sum:

arg max
ew

= Ls(λ, ew) + CLu(ew) (2)

where C is a tradeoff parameter.

3.3 Parameter Estimation
We pre-trained embeddings using word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) with the skip-gram train-
ing objective and NEC negative sampling. Un-
less otherwise stated, we used word2vec’s default
parameter settings. All embeddings were 100-
dimensional, and we used the same embeddings
for the input and output parameters in the skip-
gram objective. We optimized the joint objective
(2) using an alternative optimization strategy: we
alternated 30 iterations of CRF training on the NE
labeled data and 5 multi-threaded passes through
both the labeled and unlabeled data for the skip-
gram objective. We avoided over-fitting using
early-stopping. For simplicity, we set C = 1 for
(2). The CRF was trained using stochastic gra-
dient descent with an L2 regularizer. All model
hyper-parameters were tuned on dev data.

We use the off-the-shelf tool word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) to do skip-gram training
for language model, and implement our own CRF
model to modify the embeddings. We optimize
(2) by alternating the optimzation of each of the
two objectives.

4 Weibo NER Corpus

We constructed a corpus of Weibo messages an-
notated for NER. We followed the DEFT ERE
(Linguistics Data Consortium, 2014) 9 annotation

9See Aguilar et al. (2014) for a comparison of DEFT ERE
with other common standards.

guidelines for entities, which includes four ma-
jor semantic types: person, organization, location
and geo-political entity. We annotated both name
and nominal mentions. Chinese pronoun mentions
can be easily recognized with a regular expression.
We used Amazon Mechanical Turk, using stan-
dard methods of multiple annotators and including
gold examples to ensure high quality annotations
(Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010).

Our corpus includes 1,890 messages sampled
from Weibo between November 2013 and De-
cember 2014. Rather than selecting messages at
random, which would yield a small number of
messages with entities, we selected messages that
contained three or more (segmented) words that
were not in a fixed vocabulary of common Chi-
nese words. Initial experiments showed this gave
messages more likely to contain entities.

Table 1 shows statistics of the final corpus. We
divided the corpus into 7 folds, each with 127 mes-
sages, where each message corresponds to a single
instance. We use the first 5 folds for train, the 6th
for development, and the 7th for test. We make
our code and the annotated corpus available.10

We constructed an additional corpus of unla-
beled messages for training the embeddings. We
randomly selected 2,259,434 messages from the
same time period as above.

5 Experiments

We evaluate our methods under two settings: train-
ing on only name mentions, and training on both
name and nominal mentions. We re-train the Stan-
ford NER system (Finkel et al., 2005) as a base-
line; besides, we also evaluate our implementa-
tion of the CRF from Mao et al. (2008) as de-
scribed in §2 as Baseline Features. To this base-
line, we add each of our three embedding mod-
els: word, character, character+position (as de-
scribed in §3), and report results on the modified

report results for the joint method trained with the
character+position model (cp), which performed
the best on dev data for joint training.

General Results Table 2 shows results for both
dev (tuned) and test (held out) splits. First, we
observe that the results for the baseline are signif-
icantly below those for SIGHAN shared tasks as
well as the reported results on Twitter NER, show-
ing the difficulty of this task. In particular, recall
is especially challenging. Second, all embeddings
improve the baseline on test data, but the character
+ position model gets the best results. Fine-tuning
improves embedding results, but seems to over-
fit on dev data. Finally, our joint model does the
best in both conditions (name and name+nominal)
on test data, improving over fine-tuning, yielding
up to a 9% (absolute) improvement over a strong
baseline.

Effect of Embeddings We expect improve-
ments from embeddings to be larger when there
is less training data. Figure 2 shows F1 on dev
data for different amounts of training data, from
200 instances up to 1400, for the character + po-
sition embeddings versus the baseline model. We
see that for both settings, we see larger improve-
ments from embeddings for smaller training sets.

Error Analysis Since the results are relatively
low, we conducted an error analysis by randomly
sampling 150 error items and manually looking
through them. Among the 150 examples, 65 are
annotation errors, majorly cause by annotators ne-
glecting some mentions, this contributes 43% of
the errors. The second largest error source are
the person names: Chinese person names are very
flexible and nearly every character can be used

ary error, type error, name abbreviation, nick-
names, etc.

6 Conclusion

Our results show that NER for Chinese social me-
dia remains a challenging task, results lag be-
hind both formal Chinese text and English Twitter.
Nevertheless, our embeddings, combined with our
joint training objective, provide a large improve-
ment over a state-of-the-art model.
