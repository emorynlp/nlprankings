Abstract

In the present study we explore various methods for improving the transition-based parsing of
coordinated structures in French. Features targeting syntactic parallelism in coordinated struc-
tures are used as additional features when training the statistical model, but also as an efficient
means to find and correct annotation errors in training corpora. In terms of annotation, we com-
pare four different annotations for coordinated structures, demonstrate the importance of globally
unambiguous annotation for punctuation, and discuss the decision process of a transition-based
parser for coordination, explaining why certain annotations consistently out-perform others. We
compare the gains provided by different annotation standards, by targeted features, and by using
a wider beam. Our best configuration gives a 37.28% reduction in the coordination error rate,
when compared to the baseline SPMRL test corpus for French after manual corrections.

1 Introduction

Coordinated structures (CS) are recognised as one of the main difficulties for automatic syntax parsers.
They are particularly challenging for transition-based parsers, which operate sequentially from sentence
start to end: indeed, even for a simple coordinated structure, it is virtually impossible to determine the
first conjunct of the structure without examining the rest of the sentence. Consider the following three
sentences, identical in French up to the coordinating conjunction:

Example 1.1 - J’ai mangé une pomme rouge et mûre. (I ate a red and ripe apple)
- J’ai mangé une pomme rouge et une orange. (I ate a red apple and an orange)
- J’ai mangé une pomme rouge et Georges a bu du thé. (I ate a red apple and George drank some tea)

In the above cases, selecting the correct conjuncts is simply a matter of examining the parts-of-speech
immediately following the coordinating conjunction, except in the last case, where we have to decide
whether or not George gets eaten. Nevertheless, nothing preceding the conjunction can help us make the
decision. Often the situation is more complex, with adjuncts intervening between the conjunction and
second conjunct, not to mention cases such as various forms of ellipsis, CSs with 3 or more conjuncts,
and modifiers shared by two or more conjuncts.

In this article, after reviewing related work (section 2) and introducing CS annotation and transition-
based parsing (section 3) and our data set and software (section 4), we follow a chronological outline in
terms of our own research. In a previous study (Urieli, 2014) we successfully applied knowledge-rich
targeted features to the pos-tagging of ambiguous functional words. In the present study we turn to pars-
ing (section 5.1), and attempt to apply knowledge-rich targeted features for coordination to the SPMRL
2013 dependency corpus for French (Seddah et al., 2013). Although the results are not fully satisfactory,
we discover while tuning the features that they can be very useful for pinpointing and correcting many
of the coordination errors in the training and evaluation corpora (section 5.2). Also, while exploring the
reason behind failure to coordinate correctly, we note that the way in which coordination is annotated in
the corpus is responsible for a sizable proportion of errors. We then attempt automatic transformations

of this annotation and compare results for six different annotations (section 5.3). Finally, we combine
annotation schemes with targeted features and a wider beam to find the maximal gain that can be attained
(section 5.4).

2 Related work

Several studies have explored the annotation standards for coordination in English. However, the original
Penn Treebank annotates only a subset of simple coordinated structures implicitly by grouping the items
together in a single phrase. Maier et al. (2012) present an annotation scheme for Penn Treebank coordi-
nation which includes punctuation, critical in the case of constituency treebanks. They then (Maier and
Kübler, 2013) train a classifier to attempt to recognise coordinating vs. non-coordinating commas, and
achieve an f-score of 89.22 for the coordinating (difficult) class. Many of the phenomena they are trying
to disambiguate in the constituency treebank by annotating punctuation are disambiguated in dependency
treebanks more simply by using an appropriate set of dependency labels, e.g. in the case of apposition vs.
coordination. In the present study, we thus take a somewhat opposite approach by removing annotation
from punctuation in the dependency treebank context, in order to concentrate the decision-process on the
conjuncts themselves.

Ivanova et al. (2013) measure performance for English using three different annotations for coordi-
nation, all of which are covered by the present study. With respect to annotation, they come to similar
conclusions for English to ours for French, but concentrate on the lowest-accuracy conjunction-headed
approach, as it is proned by the grammar-based parser in which they specialize.

Popel et al. (2013) perform a survey of many different dependency annotations for coordination, and
develop a tool for lossless transformation between these annotations. They also describe in detail the
various difficulties involved in annotating coordination, including the role of punctuation.

Schwartz et al. (2012) compare the “learnability” of various possible annotations for 6 structures in
English, including coordination, where learnability is defined both by the annotation giving the highest
attachment accuracy, and by the annotation which attains a target accuracy with the fewest training
examples. They compare 2 possible annotations for coordination, and find, as we do, that using one of
the conjuncts as head is far more learnable than using the conjunction as the head, across a variety of
parsers. However, since the Penn Treebank does not annotate coordinated structures with more than 2
conjuncts, they explore fewer annotation possibilites than in the present study.

Tsarfaty et al. (2011) raise a similar question of evaluating parsers trained on different annotation stan-
dards, including for coordination, but take a radically different approach. They convert all annotations to
directly comparable generalised functional trees, and find that apparent major differences in performance
are considerably attenuated or disappear when considered in such a light. It would be interesting to apply
their method to our different annotations for French data, and see to what extent it affects results.

In terms of annotation standards, the present study extends previous work by (a) applying similar
experiments to French and consolidating certain conclusions, while concentrating on the case of 3 or
more conjuncts, (b) highlighting the importance of a systematic annotation for punctuation, which is
only possible when punctuation is not explicitly used to indicate coordination, and (c) comparing gains
from annotation changes to those made by the addition of targeted coordination features or using a wider
beam.

In terms of specific targeted features for coordination, Hogan (2007) achieves statistically signifi-
cant improvements in noun phrase (NP) coordination in English, in the context of a history-based con-
stituency parser, by introducing features for NP head semantic similarity. Shimbo and Hara (2007)
leave out semantics, and instead use features incorporating the syntactic “edit-distance” between com-
peting structures. Both studies apply to consitituency parsers with a higher complexity than our linear
transition-based parser.

Other studies have attempted introducing generic “rich” features without specifically aiming at par-
allelism in coordination. Kübler et al. (2009) propose a method whereby the n-best PCFG parses are
reranked, in order to improve the parsing of coordination in German. Their features are generic, but can
cover the full parse trees since they are applied in reranking rather than during parsing. Our study differs

from theirs by applying the features during the first parsing pass of a linear-complexity transition-based
parser, rather than requiring a large beam of n-best solutions at the outset.

Zhang and Nivre (2011; 2012) have shown the usefulness of generic “rich” features such as the valency
(number of dependents) of a given token, the distance between two tokens, a list of current unique
modifier labels for a token, and features looking at various characteristics a token’s second order governor
(its governor’s governor). They find that these features are particularly useful for global-learning based
parsers with a very high beam width (64)—this however comes with certain practical disadvantages,
since parsing speed is linearly correlated to beam width, and analysing with a beam of 64 takes 64 times
as long. In our study, we do not explore beam widths beyond 5 and do not apply global learning, and
show nevertheless that highly specific targeted features give considerable gain even in such a context.

In terms of French, De la Clergerie (2014) introduces rich symbolic features into statistical transition-
based parsing indirectly, by parsing each sentence first using FRMG, a TAG parser, and injecting fea-
tures based on the FRMG parse into the transition-based parser. He attains excellent results for French
(LAS=90.25 for the SPMRL test corpus with guessed pos-tags). However, given the need to parse
with a TAG parser, this system is not directly comparable to linear-time transition-based parsing.

3 Annotations and analysis mechanisms

Let us consider the following sentence containing a 3-conjunct coordinated structure:

Example 3.1 Je vois Jean, Paul et Marie. (I see John, Paul and Mary)

Figure 1 shows the French SPMRL dependency annotation for this sentence: all conjuncts are gov-
erned by the first conjunct via the preceding comma or conjunction.

The next question is: how is such an annotation parsed? In this study we concentrate purely on
transition-based parsing (Kübler et al., 2009). Parsing is thus defined as a series of transitions leading
from one parse configuration to the next, where a parse configuration is defined as follows:

• σ: a stack, or ordered sequence of tokens which have been partially processed

• β: a buffer, or ordered sequence of tokens which have not yet been processed

• ∆: a set of dependency arcs of the form label(governor, dependent) that have already been added

• τ : a sequence of transitions allowing us to reach the current configuration from an initial one

We will use σ0 to indicate the token currently on top of the stack, and σ1..n for tokens deeper in the
stack. Similarly, β0 indicates the next token to be processed on the buffer, and β1..n for tokens farther
down the buffer. Parsing begins with root artefact on the stack and all other tokens on the buffer. Parsing
ends when the buffer is empty. Our study uses the arc-eager transition system (Nivre, 2008), which
defines the four transitions shown in table 1 for moving from one configuration to the next.

It is well known that transition-based parsers tend to favour short-distance dependencies over longer
distance ones (McDonald and Nivre, 2007; Candito et al., 2010), since they will always compare two
closer tokens before comparing two tokens which are farther away, and the decision regarding the two
closer tokens is taken independently given the information available at this point. Thus, a closer token
is never directly compared to a token farther away when making an attachment decision. This tendency
can be somewhat curtailed by applying a beam search (Urieli and Tanguy, 2013).

Now, as already seen in example 1.1, forward-looking features are required to correctly identify the
first conjunct by guessing the second conjunct. Table 2 shows the exact sequence of transitions required
for parsing the 3rd example sentence from example 1.1, from the moment when we first encounter the
coordinating conjunction on the buffer to the moment when the CS itself has been fully parsed. Difficult
decisions are shown in bold. Among these, the reduce transitions on lines n+1 and n+2 both require us
to look farther down the buffer to guess the most likely second conjunct, since we can only reduce when
there are no more dependents to be attached. The shift transitions on lines n+4 and n+5 are simpler,
since we already know that the first conjunct is a verb. Still, we have to recognise that the second verb is
composite, which is governed by convention by the past participle rather than the helper verb.

The case of a CS with 3 or more conjuncts is even more complicated, since it requires lookahead
features for the first two conjuncts, looking farther ahead than in the case of the 2-conjuct CS. In all
cases, correctly guessing the final conjunct ahead of time is critical information to correctly annotating
the coordination.

4 Data and software

4.1 Talismane
All of the experiments in this study use the Talismane parser1. Talismane (Urieli, 2013) is an NLP toolkit
including a sentence detector, tokeniser, pos-tagger and transition-based parser. All four modules use a
statistical supervised machine learning approach, and it is possible to apply a beam search to the last
three modules, as well as defining sophisticated features and rules using an expressive feature definition
syntax. For all experiments in the present study, we used a linear SVM model with C = 0.25 and
� = 0.01. We applied a cutoff of 5, so that a feature has to appear at least 5 times in the training corpus
to be considered.

4.2 French Treebank
The original input for this study is the dependency annotation for the French section of SPMRL (Seddah
et al., 2013), itself derived from the French Treebank (Abeillé et al., 2003), via an automatic conversion
of constituency structures to dependencies. We use the train (14,759 sentences, 412,879 tokens), dev
(1,235 sentences, 36,272 tokens) and test (2,541 sentences, 69,922 tokens) divisions of this corpus
as defined for SPMRL. All of our studies use the gold pos-tags from the treebank, in order to make an
abstraction of pos-tagger errors and concentrate on parsing. The baseline LAS excluding punctuation is
89.57% (dev) and 89.45% (test). The baseline f-score for coordinated structures, calculated as the
f-score for all individual coordination arcs, is 84.35% (dev) and 85.16% (test).

4.3 Initial error classification
We began this study by analysing coordination errors performed by Talismane in the dev corpus. Out of
240 errors analysed, 24% were annotation errors (of which over 60% were correctly annotated by Talis-
mane), 14% were artefacts of the annotation scheme (the 2nd and 3rd conjunct were directly coordinated
by Talismane unlike the original annotation), and 30% were errors where Talismane coordinated two
different pos-tags, whereas the correct coordination involved the same pos-tag. If we group this together
with other cases of simple parallelism (e.g. cases where Talismane coordinated different prepositions
instead of the same prepostion), this climbs up to 38%. The remaining 24% covered various difficult
cases, including elliptical coordinations. Only 12% involved cases where semantics were required to
make the correct choice.

The cases where the mildly rich French morphology might help us are very rare: only three cases
among the dev corpus errors. In the examples below and elsewhere in this article, the guessed conjuncts
are shown in italics (non-italics for the English translation), the correct conjuncts are underlined, and the
conjunction is shown in bold. In the first example, the feminine demonstrative pronoun celle indicates
that we are coordinating with the feminine noun présidence rather than with M. Michel Albert:
Example 4.1 [. . . ] on avait parlé de la présidence des AGF à la place de M. Michel Albert ou de celle
du GAN occupée par M. François Heilbronner. (. . . they spoke of the presidency of the AGFs instead of
Mr Michel Albert or of that of the GAN occupied by Mr François Heilbronner.)

In the second case, the masculine past participle rejeté should coordinate with the masculine past
participle opté rather than the feminine faite:
Example 4.2 Le conseil d’administration [. . . ] a opté pour la proposition de reprise faite par Bongrain
et rejeté celle de Besnier. (The board of directors chose the takeover proposal made by Bongrain and
rejected the one made by Besnier.)

In the final example, a plural adjective répétitifs is coordinated with a plural adjectival past participle
construits, rather than a previous morphologically unadorned past participle découvert in a conjugated
construction:
Example 4.3 [. . . ] les Européens ont découvert/VPP l’immensité du stock japonais : [. . . ] scénarios
répétitifs/ADJ mais habilement construits/VPP [. . . ] (the Europeans discovered the immensity of the
Japanese stock: repetitive and skillfully constructed scenarios. . . )

Because of the rarity of such cases, we decided not to include morpholigical features in our experi-
ments.

5 Experiments

5.1 Initial experiment with targeted features
We first decided to target the 38% of errors relating to simple parallelism (e.g. parallelism errors related
to mismatched pos-tags or prepositions, rather than semantics).

Because of the importance of identifying a second conjunct before identifying the first one, we first
constructed the following targeted feature:

• Second conjunct identification: attempts to correctly identify the second conjunct. Since all
subsequent features depend on this second conjunct feature, it was critical to attain high accuracy.
Also, since the feature is a component of features used to select the first conjunct, it can only make
use of information available when a first conjunct candidate is at σ0 and the conjunction at β0 (steps
1, 2 and 3 in table 2): critically, it tries to guess the second conjunct with no knowledge of the
correct first conjunct.

The most difficult cases for this feature are verbs, since both coordinated verbs need to be outside of
subordinate, relative or comment phrases. Comment phrases, particularly numerous in journalistic text,
and marked only by punctuation, word order, and lexical choices, are the most difficult to recognise. The
following list shows examples of sentences with two conjugated verbs (in italics), and with the conjuncts
underlined.

1. Verb coordination: Il s’agit ici d’un jour normal de la semaine et un inventaire scrupuleux exigerait
que l’on prenne également en compte l’offre accrue du mercredi. (We are dealing here with a normal
weekday, and a scupulous inventory would require us to take into account the increased offer on
Wednesdays.)

2. Verb coordination: Les chiffres parlent d’eux-mêmes : les Japonais occupent 30 % du marché
américain et leurs exportations représentent près de 75 % du déficit commercial global annuel.
(The numbers speak for themselves: the Japanese occupy 30% of the American market and their
exports represent almost 75% of the annual global commercial deficit.)

3. Comment phrase: A Lourdes, nous signale notre correspondant Jean-Jacques Rollat, la venue et
la circulation des pèlerins ont été très perturbées. (At Lourdes, signals our correspondent Jean-
Jacques Rollat, the arrival and circulation of pilgrims was considerably disrupted.)

4. Relative clause: Les émissions d’éveil qui ont fait la richesse des chaı̂nes de service public entre
1975 et 1985 ont toutes disparu. (The discovery programmes which constituted the richness of
public channels between 1975 and 1985 have all disappeared.)

We tested this feature on the training corpus, by applying it whenever a conjunction was found in
σ0, and seeing how often it correctly guessed “true” when the token in β0 was the second conjunct, and
“false” when the token in β0 was not the second conjunct, while ignoring knowledge of the first conjunct.
The accuracy for the “true” result is 99.07%, and for the “false” result is 94.54%.

We then used this feature to construct various features attempting to recognise parallelism in CS within
the framework of transition-based parsing. Most of these features compare the item currently at the top-
of-stack to the second conjunct guess, and check to see if there is a better candidate deeper in the stack.
The following features were used:

• Pos-tag mismatch: if the first conjunct candidate at the top-of-stack has a different pos-tag from
the second conjunct guess, does a candidate with the same pos-tag exist deeper on the stack?

• Mismatched prepositions: if the first candidate at the top-of-stack and the second conjunct guess
are two different prepositions, does the same preposition exist deeper on the stack?

31



• Pos-tag match: if the first conjunct candidate at the top-of-stack is the same pos-tag as the second
conjunct guess, are there any other candidates with this pos-tag deeper on the stack?

• 3 conjunct parallelism: when two tokens of the same pos-tag, separated by a comma, are being
compared, is the second token followed by a coordinating conjunction and then a third token with
the same pos-tag as the first two? We allow for various intervening modifiers depending on the
pos-tag being considered.

• Parentheses: is the first conjunct candidate at the top-of-stack inside parentheses and the second
conjunct guess outside of them?

When we first attempted to apply these features to our dev (and test) corpora, our f-score for
coordination (coord and dep coord combined) improved from 84.34% to 85.52% (85.16% to 86.97%
for test), giving a fairly modest error reduction of 7.54% (12.20% for test). In terms of significance,
McNemar’s test gives a p-value < 0.001 for coordination label changes in both dev and test.

Now, there are of course cases in the training corpus with valid non-parallel structures, such as the
following coordination between an adjective and prepositional phrase:

Example 5.1 Au mieux, la reprise sera lente/ADJ et de/P faible ampleur. (At best, the recovery will be
slow and of limited extent.)

These, however, are few and far in between when compared to the very large number of errors concern-
ing clear pos-tag parallelism. We will examine some errors introduced by applying targeted parallelism
features to non-parallel CSs in our final error analysis found in section 5.4.

5.2 Improvements through manual correction
The targeted feature definition involved several iterations in which features were projected onto the train-
ing corpus, and any unexpected results were analysed. Among the unexpected results were a very large
number of annotation errors. Given that 24% of the original errors in the dev corpus were annotation er-
rors, and our efficient method for pinpointing and correcting such errors by projecting targeted features,
we decided to apply these targeted manual corrections to the entire SPMRL French corpus (train, dev
and test).

Specifically, these manual corrections involved:

• Fixing any coordination where the dependent preceded the governor (impossible in the original
annotation standard)

• Reviewing and standardizing all cases of ni. . . ni. . . (neither. . . nor. . . ) and soit. . . soit. . . (ei-
ther. . . or. . . ).

• Projecting the above targeted features onto the corpus via Talismane, and correcting any items where
the feature yielded unexpected results.

The total corrections are 1,488 for train (out of 21,061 coordination relations = 7.07%), 106 for dev
(out of 1,743 coordination relations = 6.08%) and 274 for test (out of 3,420 coordination relations =
8.01%). Multi-word expressions (MWEs) were left as is, except on rare cases where a modifier inside
the MWE was coordinated to a modifier outside of it.

dev base dev fix test base test fix
train base 84.34 85.08 85.16 85.54
train fix 83.99 85.75 84.99 86.75

Table 3: Coordination f-score after targeted manual error correction

Table 3 shows the coordination f-score with and without targeted error correction in both training and
evaluation. Fixing errors in the training corpus is only useful when equivalent errors are fixed in the

evaluation corpora. If we consider the corrected evaluation corpora only, fixing errors in the training
corpus gives an f-score error reduction of 4.49% for dev (8.37% for test).

The remainder of this study uses the manually corrected corpora as a baseline. Although this is not
satisfying in terms of comparisons with other studies, we found ourselves constrained to do so because
our automatic conversions from one annotation scheme to another required a clean and consistent anno-
tation to begin with. In order to simplify comparisons, we have generated a difference file to apply to the
original SPMRL corpus, available upon request.

5.3 Comparing annotation schemes

As seen in section 4.3, over 14% of the initial errors were artefacts of the annotation scheme for a
CS with more than 2 conjuncts, where Talismane systematically attached the conjunct to the previous
conjunct, whereas the original annotation scheme systematically attaches it to the first conjunct. Indeed,
the previous conjunct attachment is more natural for transition-based parsers: since the comma is a highly
ambiguous indicator for coordination, the coordination is often missed between the first and second
conjuncts, and the first conjunct is reduced. By the time the parser reaches the coordinating conjunction,
only the second conjunct is left on the stack. This suggested that changing the CS annotation scheme
could lead to considerable improvements.

We therefore decided to experiment with four different equivalent CS annotation schemes, as shown in
figure 2. Subfigure 2a gives the original 1H (1st conjunct headed) annotation used in the SPMRL 2013
dependency corpus for French. The first conjunct always heads the CS, and governs the coordinating
commas and conjunction with a coord label, which in turn govern the remaining conjuncts with a
dep coord label. Subfigure 2b shows the CH (conjunction headed) annotation, used by a wide variety
of grammars: the conjunction governs all of the conjuncts with a coord label. Subfigure 2c shows the
PH (previous conjunct headed) annotation, in which each conjunct governs the following coordinator
(whether a comma or a conjunction) with the coord label, and the coordinator governs the following
conjunct with the dep coord label. Finally, subfigure 2d shows the PH2 annotation, in which we skip
the comma, so that conjuncts separated by a comma are directly governed by the previous conjunct using
the coord label. In the case of a simple CS with 2 conjuncts, the PH and PH2 annotations are identical
to the 1H annotation.

Notice that there is no loss of information between these four annotations, so that round-trip conver-
sions can restore the original annotation. Post-positioned shared modifiers (e.g. “Jean, Paul et Marie
Dupont”, where all three are members of the Dupont family) can be indicated by having the conjunc-
tion govern the shared modifier in the CH annotation, and having the 1st conjunct govern it in the other
annotations. This annotation becomes non-projective (i.e. involves crossed dependency arcs) in 1H, PH
and PH2 when the modifier applies to the objects of a prepositional phrase coordination, e.g. “Je parle

33



de Jean, de Paul, et de Marie Dupont” (“I’m talking about John, Paul and Marie Dupont”). Since we
use a projective parser in the present study, we change the governor to the final conjunct when required
to avoid non-projectivity, thus losing some information. The 1H, PH and PH2 have no simple way of
distinguishing ante-positioned shared modifiers from modifiers of the first conjunct, e.g. “Chers Jean,
Paul et Marie” (“Dear John, Paul and Mary”). Moreover, none of these annotation schemes provide a
clear solution for elliptical coordinations, e.g. “J’ai vu Jean et Paul hier, et Marie aujourd’hui” (“I saw
John and Paul yesterday, and Mary today”).

Another possibility for annotation was suggested by detailed analysis of the actual transition sequences
for the first 20 coordination errors, revealing two cases in which, if a comma followed the first conjunct,
the first conjunct was erroneously reduced. This suggested that having to take a decision when the comma
was found at β0 led to errors which could be eliminated if the comma were immediately attached and only
used as a feature for further decisions. Now, if we look at the French Treebank annotation for punctuation
outside of coordinated structures, the label is always ponct, but the choice of the punctuation’s governor
seems fairly arbitrary. Parser confidence is thus very low for punctuation attachment decisions, and as
a result, when applying a beam search, the beam is often filled with alternative arbitrary punctuation
attachment decisions instead of true syntactic ambiguities. We therefore decided to experiment as well
with attaching punctuation systematically to the previous non-punctation token (or to the root artefact
when punctuation opens the sentence), except in the case of coordinating commas for the 1H and PH
annotations. Indeed, for the CH and PH2 schemes, we were forced to apply this punctuation “fix”
in order to avoid generating a large number of non-projective punctuation arcs when transforming the
corpus. In these latter two annotations, where coordinated commas are not used to annotate the CS,
applying a punctuation fix results in systematic annotation for all punctuation in the corpus, thus resulting
in a systematic application of the right-arcponct and reduce transitions.

We thus make the hypothesis that transition-based parsers will favour those annotations which rely
on shorter-distance dependencies, specifically PH and PH2. Our second hypothesis is that systematic
annotation for commas (PH2) helps improve annotation by removing a needless source of ambiguity.

Table 4: Comparing CS annotation

Table 4 shows results for the six annotation schemes (where +P indicates the punctuation fix was ap-
plied): 1H, 1H+P, CH+P, PH, PH+P, PH2+P. All results are after targeted manual correction. For ease of
comparison with previous studies, we show LAS and UAS both with and without punctuation. Unsur-
prisingly, in the schemes without the punctuation fix, hence with arbitrary attachment for punctuation,
we systematically lose 2% when we include punctuation in the LAS/UAS, whereas in the schemes with

34



the punctuation fix we systematically gain over 1%.
In the coordination results, we include both the coord and dep coord labels, since different

schemes have different proportions for these. Precision is very high because of the strong markers
for coordination. Recall is much lower, because of the difficulty of finding the first conjunct. The
conjunction-headed scheme CH+P is a clear loser in transition-based parsing—hardly a surprising re-
sult, since it requires far more lookahead features. All of the previous-conjunct headed schemes (PH,
PH+P, PH2+P) outperform the first-conjunct headed schemes (1H, 1H+P) by over 1.5% when it comes
to the coordination f-score, which validates our hypothesis based on the analysis of errors in section
4.3. Finally, the clear winner is the PH2+P scheme, where all attachment ambiguity is transposed from
punctuation to the conjuncts, with 2.0% gain in coordination f-score with respect to the PH+P scheme.
The coordination f-score error reduction between the original 1H scheme and PH2+P is 24.28% for dev
(26.72% for test). In terms of statistical significance for both the dev and test corpora (McNemar’s
test applied to identifying individual conjuncts), the differences between 1H, 1H+P, PH and PH+P are
not significant (p-value > 0.05). The differences between any other schema and CH+P or PH2+P are
highly significant (p-value < 0.001).

5.4 Combining with targeted features
In our final experiment, we combine the PH2+P annotation scheme with the targeted features presented
in section 5.1, to see to what extent the gains are cumulative. We also test at different beam widths to see
how much additional gain can be had at higher beams.

Table 5: Combining annotation schemes and targeted features at different beam widths

Table 5 shows the results at beams 1, 2 and 5, for the original scheme 1H and the best scheme PH2+P,
and with (+) or without (∅) targeted features. Gains are clearly centered on coordination recall. Table 6
shows the same information in terms of f-score error reduction with respect to the baseline configuration
(1H annotation, baseline features, beam 1), with a maximal reduction of 35.09% for the dev corpus, and
37.28% for test. The three parameters tested are to a large extend cumulative. Individually, changing
the annotation standard gives the most gain, followed by targeted features and then increasing the beam
size to 2. In terms of statistical significance for the test corpus (McNemar’s test applied to identifying
individual conjuncts), all combinations are significant (p-value < 0.05) except for: PH2+P/∅/1-2 to
PH2+P/∅/5; PH2+P/+/2 to PH2+P/+/5; and a few other combinations going from 1H/+ to PH2+P/∅.

Table 6: Coordination f-score error reduction with respect to 1H, baseline features, beam 1

In terms of time performance, these changes have a vastly different cost. All tests were run on an Intel
Xeon E3-1245 V2 machine, with a 3.4GHz clock speed, 4 cores, 8 threads, and 8 Mb cache, running the
Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS 64-bit operating system. The baseline setup takes 171 seconds to parse the test
corpus (+133 seconds to load the model and lexicon), giving about 400 tokens/second. Changing the
schema from 1H to PH2+P speeds up analysis slightly (×0.93). Changing the beam width results in a
linear increase in time, ×2 for a beam of 2, and ×5 for a beam of 5. Finally, targeted features result in a
×22 increase in time.

We also performed a detailed error analysis for dev corpus, on the remaining errors in the PH2+P
corpus with targeted features at beam 1. Although the number of erroneous coordinations analysed has
reduced from 241 to 151, the percentage of errors relating to simple parallelism (pos-tag mismatch,
preposition mismatch, etc.) remains stable, down from 38% to 36%. Annotation errors are reduced from
24% to 11%. Artefacts of the annotation scheme in which conjuncts are attached to the first or second
conjunct are reduced from 15% to 5%. Finally, the complicated cases have climbed significantly, with
ellipses climbing from 5% to 13% and cases where only semantics can help us decide climbing from
12% to 23%. The latter results indicates that introducing semantic resources might be worthwhile for the
remaining errors.

There are a few cases of CSs coordinating unlike categories, where the new features introduced errors.
We have a two cases of true non-parallelism, as in the following case, where an adjectival past participle
is coordinated with a prepositional phrase:
Example 5.2 [. . . ] celle d’/P une part significative des programmes et des productions réalisées/VPP
ou en cours de/P réalisation. (. . . that of a significant part of programs and productions that are already
finished or currently being prepared.)

We have a similar valid case of a non-parallel copula coordinating an adjective with a pronoun :
Example 5.3 Ce n’est/V pas forcément la plus économiquement souhaitable/ADJ, mais celle/PRO qui
fera le moins de vagues, compte tenu de l’agitation dans les campagnes, entendait/V-on [. . . ] (It’s not
necessarily the most economically desirable, but the one which will make the least waves, given the
restlessness in the countryside, we were told. . . )

The remaining cases are related to spelling errors in the original text, or to tokenisation and pos-tag
errors in the gold pos-tags. For example, in the following case, the journalist misspelt the second baisser
(to lower) as an infinitive verb whereas it should have been the homophone past participle baissé:
Example 5.4 Quant au dollar lui-même, il a monté/V quand on croyait qu’il allait baisser/VINF [. . . ] et
baisser/VINF derechef quand le marché commençait à se convaincre. . . (As for the dollar itself, it rose
when we thought it would lower, and lower[ed] once again when the market started to convince itself. . . )

A second case involves the MWE conformément aux (in conformance with), which should probably
be marked as a single preposition rather than ADV+P:
Example 5.5 Dans le cas des/P céréales, et conformément/ADV aux/P orientations souhaitées par les
organisations professionnelles [. . . ] (In the case of cereals, and in conformance with the desires of
professional organisations, . . . )

36



Similar cases involve the pos-tagging of généraux as a noun (generals in an army) rather than an
adjective (general):

Example 5.6 [. . . ] à l’ensemble des présidents/NC des conseils régionaux/ADJ et généraux/NC. (. . . to
all of the presidents of regional and general councils.)

6 Conclusions and perspectives

In the present study, we attempted to improve the parsing of coordinated structures in French through
changes to the annotation scheme and the application of targeted features. Both methods were successful,
with annotation scheme changes reducing the test corpus coordination f-score error rate by 26.72%,
targeted features reducing it by 12.91%, and the two combined reducing it by 34.64% (36.83% at beam
2, 37.28% at beam 5).

However, the application of targeted features comes at a considerable practical cost in terms of time
performance (×22 increase in time). This is partly due to the fact that features are described in configu-
ration files using a declarative syntax, so that certain operations (e.g. looking forward in the buffer) are
repeated thousands of times. Indeed, forward-looking features do not rely on partial parsing information,
and could even be cached for any given token for the entire sentence parse, across parse configurations.
If features were programmed and compiled, this could be made far more efficient, but we would lose the
advantage of external configuration files.

In addition, we introduced a method for efficiently correcting training corpus errors through the pro-
jection of targeted features, a method which could be extremely useful for corpus constructors. Finally,
we highlighted the usefulness of removing all ambiguity from the annotation of punctuation.

In a future study, we would need to test these methods with guessed pos-tags rather than gold pos-tags
in order to check their sensitivity to pos-tag errors. It would also be interesting to apply our methods
to other languages, and to include targeted semantic features based on semantic resources automatically
constructed using semi-supervised methods. For languages with a richer morphology than French, it
might well be worthwhile to introduce features based on morphological parallelism as well. Finally,
various methods would have to be explored for improving the time performance of targeted features, if
possible without losing the configurability and flexibility of declarative feature files.
