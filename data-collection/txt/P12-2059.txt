Abstract

We propose several techniques for improv-
ing statistical machine translation between
closely-related languages with scarce re-
sources. We use character-level translation
trained on n-gram-character-aligned bitexts
and tuned using word-level BLEU, which we
further augment with character-based translit-
eration at the word level and combine with
a word-level translation model. The evalua-
tion on Macedonian-Bulgarian movie subtitles
shows an improvement of 2.84 BLEU points
over a phrase-based word-level baseline.

1 Introduction

Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, re-
quire parallel corpora of sentences and their transla-
tions, called bitexts, which are often not sufficiently
large. However, for many closely-related languages,
SMT can be carried out even with small bitexts by
exploring relations below the word level.

Closely-related languages such as Macedonian
and Bulgarian exhibit a large overlap in their vo-
cabulary and strong syntactic and lexical similari-
ties. Spelling conventions in such related languages
can still be different, and they may diverge more
substantially at the level of morphology. However,
the differences often constitute consistent regulari-
ties that can be generalized when translating.

The language similarities and the regularities in
morphological variation and spelling motivate the
use of character-level translation models, which
were applied to translation (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiede-
mann, 2009a) and transliteration (Matthews, 2007).

(without scores): mappings can cover words and phrases.

Certainly, translation cannot be adequately mod-
eled as simple transliteration, even for closely-
related languages. However, the strength of phrase-
based SMT (Koehn et al., 2003) is that it can support
rather large sequences (phrases) that capture transla-
tions of entire chunks. This makes it possible to in-
clude mappings that go far beyond the edit-distance-
based string operations usually modeled in translit-
eration. Table 1 shows how character-level phrase
tables can cover mappings spanning over multi-word
units. Thus, character-level phrase-based SMT mod-
els combine the generality of character-by-character
transliteration and lexical mappings of larger units
that could possibly refer to morphemes, words or
phrases, as well as to various combinations thereof.

2 Training Character-level SMT Models

We treat sentences as sequences of characters in-
stead of words, as shown in Figure 1. Due to the
reduced vocabulary, we can use higher-order mod-
els, which is necessary in order to avoid the genera-
tion of non-word sequences. In our case, we opted
for a 10-character language model and a maximum
phrase length of 10 (based on initial experiments).

However, word alignment models are not fit for
character-level SMT, where the vocabulary shrinks.

Figure 1: Preparing the training corpus for alignment.

Statistical word alignment models heavily rely on
context-independent lexical translation parameters
and, therefore, are unable to properly distinguish
character mapping differences in various contexts.
The alignment models used in the transliteration lit-
erature have the same problem as they are usually
based on edit distance operations and finite-state au-
tomata without contextual history (Jiampojamarn et
al., 2007; Damper et al., 2005; Ristad and Yiani-
los, 1998). We, thus, transformed the input to se-
quences of character n-grams as suggested by Tiede-
mann (2012); examples are shown in Figure 1. This
artificially increases the vocabulary as shown in Ta-
ble 2, making standard alignment models and their
lexical translation parameters more expressive.

character trigrams 13,794 14,305
words 41,816 30,927

Table 2: Vocabulary size of character-level alignment
models and the corresponding word-level model.

It turns out that bigrams constitute a good com-
promise between generality and contextual speci-
ficity, which yields useful character alignments with
good performance in terms of phrase-based transla-
tion. In our experiments, we used GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) with standard settings and the grow-
diagonal-final-and heuristics to symmetrize the fi-
nal IBM-model-4-based Viterbi alignments (Brown
et al., 1993). The phrases were extracted and scored
using the Moses training tools (Koehn et al., 2007).1

We tuned the parameters of the log-linear SMT
model using minimum error rate training (Och,
2003), optimizing BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

1Note that the extracted phrase table does not include se-
quences of character n-grams. We map character n-gram align-
ments to links between single characters before extraction.

Since BLEU over matching character sequences
does not make much sense, especially if the k-gram
size is limited to small values of k (usually, 4 or
less), we post-processed n-best lists in each tuning
step to calculate the usual word-based BLEU score.

3 Transliteration

We also built a character-level SMT system for
word-level transliteration, which we trained on a list
of automatically extracted pairs of likely cognates.

3.1 Cognate Extraction
Classic NLP approaches to cognate extraction look
for words with similar spelling that co-occur in par-
allel sentences (Kondrak et al., 2003). Since our
Macedonian-Bulgarian bitext (MK–BG) was small,
we further used a MK–EN and an EN–BG bitext.

First, we induced IBM-model-4 word alignments
for MK–EN and EN–BG, from which we extracted
four conditional lexical translation probabilities:
Pr(m|e) and Pr(e|m) for MK–EN, and Pr(b|e) and
Pr(e|b) for EN–BG, where m, e, and b stand for a
Macedonian, an English, and a Bulgarian word.

Then, following (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Wu
and Wang, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), we
induced conditional lexical translation probabilities
as Pr(m|b) =

∑
e Pr(m|e) Pr(e|b), where Pr(m|e)

and Pr(e|b) are estimated using maximum likeli-
hood from MK–EN and EN–BG word alignments.

Then, we induced translation probability estima-
tions for the reverse direction Pr(b|m) and we cal-
culated the quantity Piv(m, b) = Pr(m|b) Pr(b|m).
We calculated a similar quantity Dir(m, b), where
the probabilities Pr(m|b) and Pr(b|m) are estimated
using maximum likelihood from the MK–BG bitext
directly. Finally, we calculated the similarity score
S(m, b) = Piv(m, b)+Dir(m, b)+2×LCSR(m, b),
where LCSR is the longest common subsequence of
two strings, divided by the length of the longer one.

The score S(m, b) is high for words that are likely
to be cognates, i.e., that (i) have high probability of
being mutual translations, which is expressed by the
first two terms in the summation, and (ii) have sim-
ilar spelling, as expressed by the last term. Here we
give equal weight to Dir(m, b) and Piv(m, b); we
also give equal weights to the translational similar-
ity (the sum of the first two terms) and to the spelling
similarity (twice LCSR).

302



We excluded all words of length less than three, as
well as all Macedonian-Bulgarian word pairs (m, b)
for which Piv(m, b) + Dir(m, b) < 0.01, and those
for which LCSR(m, b) was below 0.58, a value
found by Kondrak et al. (2003) to work well for a
number of European language pairs.

Finally, using S(m, b), we induced a weighted bi-
partite graph, and we performed a greedy approxi-
mation to the maximum weighted bipartite matching
in that graph using competitive linking (Melamed,
2000), to produce the final list of cognate pairs.

Note that the above-described cognate extraction
algorithm has three important components: (1) or-
thographic, based on LCSR, (2) semantic, based
on word alignments and pivoting over English, and
(3) competitive linking. The orthographic compo-
nent is essential when looking for cognates since
they must have similar spelling by definition, while
the semantic component prevents the extraction of
false friends like vreden, which means ‘valuable’
in Macedonian but ‘harmful’ in Bulgarian. Finally,
competitive linking helps prevent issues related to
word inflection that cannot be handled using the se-
mantic component alone.

3.2 Transliteration Training

For each pair in the list of cognate pairs, we added
spaces between any two adjacent letters for both
words, and we further appended special start and
end characters. We split the resulting list into
training, development and testing parts and we
trained and tuned a character-level Macedonian-
Bulgarian phrase-based monotone SMT system sim-
ilar to that in (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Tiedemann
and Nabende, 2009; Nakov and Ng, 2009; Nakov
and Ng, 2012). The system used a character-level
Bulgarian language model trained on words. We set
the maximum phrase length and the language model
order to 10, and we tuned the system using MERT.

3.3 Transliteration Lattice Generation

Given a Macedonian sentence, we generated a lat-
tice where each input Macedonian word of length
three or longer was augmented with Bulgarian al-
ternatives: n-best transliterations generated by the
above character-level Macedonian-Bulgarian SMT
system (after the characters were concatenated to
form a word and the special symbols were removed).

In the lattice, we assigned the original Macedo-
nian word the weight of 1; for the alternatives, we
assigned scores between 0 and 1 that were the sum
of the translation model probabilities of generating
each alternative (the sum was needed since some op-
tions appeared multiple times in the n-best list).

4 Experiments and Evaluation

For our experiments, we used translated movie sub-
titles from the OPUS corpus (Tiedemann, 2009b).
For Macedonian-Bulgarian there were only about
102,000 aligned sentences containing approximately
1.3 million tokens altogether. There was substan-
tially more monolingual data available for Bulgar-
ian: about 16 million sentences containing ca. 136
million tokens.

However, this data was noisy. Thus, we realigned
the corpus using hunalign and we removed some
Bulgarian files that were misclassified as Macedo-
nian and vice versa, using a BLEU-filter. Fur-
thermore, we also removed sentence pairs contain-
ing language-specific characters on the wrong side.
From the remaining data we selected 10,000 sen-
tence pairs (roughly 128,000 words) for develop-
ment and another 10,000 (ca. 125,000 words) for
testing; we used the rest for training.

The evaluation results are summarized in Table 3.

Transliteration. The top rows of Table 3 show
the results for Macedonian-Bulgarian transliteration.
First, we can see that the BLEU score for the original
Macedonian testset evaluated against the Bulgarian
reference is 10.74, which is quite high and reflects
the similarity between the two languages. The next
line (t1) shows that many differences between Mace-
donian and Bulgarian stem from mere differences in
orthography: we mapped the six letters in the Mace-
donian alphabet that do not exist in the Bulgarian al-
phabet to corresponding Bulgarian letters and letter
sequences, gaining over 1.3 BLEU points. The fol-
lowing line (t2) shows the results using the sophis-
ticated transliteration described in Section 3, which
takes two kinds of context into account: (1) word-
internal letter context, and (2) sentence-level word
context. We generated a lattice for each Macedonian
test sentence, which included the original Mace-
donian words and the 1-best2 Bulgarian transliter-
ation option from the character-level transliteration
model. We then decoded the lattice using a Bulgar-
ian language model; this increased BLEU to 22.74.

Word-level translation. Naturally, lattice-based
transliteration cannot really compete against stan-
dard word-level translation (w1), which is better
by 8 BLEU points. Still, as line (w2) shows,
using the 1-best transliteration lattice as an input
to (w1) yields3 consistent improvement over (w1)
for four evaluation metrics: BLEU (Papineni et
al., 2002), NIST v. 13, TER (Snover et al., 2006)
v. 0.7.25, and METEOR (Lavie and Denkowski,
2009) v. 1.3. The baseline system is also signifi-
cantly better than the on-line version of Apertium
(http://www.apertium.org/), a shallow transfer-rule-
based MT system that is optimized for closely-
related languages (accessed on 2012/05/02). Here,
Apertium suffers badly from a large number of un-
known words in our testset (ca. 15%).

Character-level translation. Moving down to
the next group of experiments in Table 3, we can
see that standard character-level SMT (c1), i.e.,
simply treating characters as separate words, per-
forms significantly better than word-level SMT. Us-
ing bigram-based character alignments yields fur-
ther improvement of +0.43 BLEU.

2Using 3/5/10/100-best made very little difference.
3The decoder can choose between (a) translating a Macedo-

nian word and (b) using its 1-best Bulgarian transliteration.

System combination. Since word-level and
character-level models have different strengths and
weaknesses, we further tried to combine them.
We used MEMT, a state-of-the-art Multi-Engine
Machine Translation system (Heafield and Lavie,
2010), to combine the outputs of (c3) with the out-
put of (w1) and of (w2). Both combinations im-
proved over the individual systems, but (w1)+(c2)
performed better, by +0.6 BLEU points over (c2).

Combining word-level and phrase-level SMT.
Finally, we also combined (w1) with (c3) in a more
direct way: by merging their phrase tables. First,
we split the phrases in the word-level phrase tables
of (w1) to characters as in character-level models.
Then, we generated four versions of each phrase
pair: with/without “ ” at the beginning/end of the
phrase. Finally, we merged these phrase pairs with
those in the phrase table of (c3), adding two ex-
tra features indicating each phrase pair’s origin: the
first/second feature is 1 if the pair came from the
first/second table, and 0.5 otherwise. This combina-
tion outperformed MEMT, probably because it ex-
pands the search space of the SMT system more di-
rectly. We further tried scoring with two language
models in the process of translation, character-based
and word-based, but we did not get consistent im-
provements. Finally, we experimented with a 1-best
character-level lattice input that encodes the same
options and weights as for (w2). This yielded our
best overall BLEU score of 33.94, which is +2.84
BLEU points of absolute improvement over the (w1)
baseline, and +1.23 BLEU points over (c2).4

5 Conclusion and Future Work
We have explored several combinations of character-
and word-level translation models for translating
between closely-related languages with scarce re-
sources. In future work, we want to use such a model
for pivot-based translations from the resource-poor
language (Macedonian) to other languages (such as
English) via the related language (Bulgarian).
