Abstract

We present a discriminative model that di-
rectly predicts which set of phrasal transla-
tion rules should be extracted from a sen-
tence pair. Our model scores extraction
sets: nested collections of all the overlap-
ping phrase pairs consistent with an under-
lying word alignment. Extraction set mod-
els provide two principle advantages over
word-factored alignment models. First,
we can incorporate features on phrase
pairs, in addition to word links. Second,
we can optimize for an extraction-based
loss function that relates directly to the
end task of generating translations. Our
model gives improvements in alignment
quality relative to state-of-the-art unsuper-
vised and supervised baselines, as well
as providing up to a 1.4 improvement in
BLEU score in Chinese-to-English trans-
lation experiments.

1 Introduction

In the last decade, the field of statistical machine
translation has shifted from generating sentences
word by word to systems that recycle whole frag-
ments of training examples, expressed as transla-
tion rules. This general paradigm was first pur-
sued using contiguous phrases (Och et al., 1999;
Koehn et al., 2003), and has since been general-
ized to a wide variety of hierarchical and syntactic
formalisms. The training stage of statistical sys-
tems focuses primarily on discovering translation
rules in parallel corpora.

Most systems discover translation rules via a
two-stage pipeline: a parallel corpus is aligned at
the word level, and then a second procedure ex-
tracts fragment-level rules from word-aligned sen-
tence pairs. This paper offers a model-based alter-
native to phrasal rule extraction, which merges this

two-stage pipeline into a single step. We present a
discriminative model that directly predicts which
set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted
from a sentence pair. Our model predicts extrac-
tion sets: combinatorial objects that include the
set of all overlapping phrasal translation rules con-
sistent with an underlying word-level alignment.
This approach provides additional discriminative
power relative to word aligners because extraction
sets are scored based on the phrasal rules they con-
tain in addition to word-to-word alignment links.
Moreover, the structure of our model directly re-
flects the purpose of alignment models in general,
which is to discover translation rules.

We address several challenges to training and
applying an extraction set model. First, we would
like to leverage existing word-level alignment re-
sources. To do so, we define a deterministic map-
ping from word alignments to extraction sets, in-
spired by existing extraction procedures. In our
mapping, possible alignment links have a precise
interpretation that dictates what phrasal translation
rules can be extracted from a sentence pair. This
mapping allows us to train with existing annotated
data sets and use the predictions from word-level
aligners as features in our extraction set model.

Second, our model solves a structured predic-
tion problem, and the choice of loss function dur-
ing training affects model performance. We opti-
mize for a phrase-level F-measure in order to fo-
cus learning on the task of predicting phrasal rules
rather than word alignment links.

Third, our discriminative approach requires that
we perform inference in the space of extraction
sets. Our model does not factor over disjoint word-
to-word links or minimal phrase pairs, and so ex-
isting inference procedures do not directly apply.
However, we show that the dynamic program for
a block ITG aligner can be augmented to score ex-
traction sets that are indexed by underlying ITG
word alignments (Wu, 1997). We also describe a

coarse-to-fine inference approach that allows us to
scale our method to long sentences.

Our extraction set model outperforms both un-
supervised and supervised word aligners at pre-
dicting word alignments and extraction sets. We
also demonstrate that extraction sets are useful for
end-to-end machine translation. Our model im-
proves translation quality relative to state-of-the-
art Chinese-to-English baselines across two pub-
licly available systems, providing total BLEU im-
provements of 1.2 in Moses, a phrase-based sys-
tem, and 1.4 in a Joshua, a hierarchical system
(Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009)

2 Extraction Set Models

The input to our model is an unaligned sentence
pair, and the output is an extraction set of phrasal
translation rules. Word-level alignments are gen-
erated as a byproduct of inference. We first spec-
ify the relationship between word alignments and
extraction sets, then define our model.

2.1 Extraction Sets from Word Alignments

Rule extraction is a standard concept in machine
translation: word alignment constellations license
particular sets of overlapping rules, from which
subsets are selected according to limits on phrase
length (Koehn et al., 2003), number of gaps (Chi-
ang, 2007), count of internal tree nodes (Galley et
al., 2006), etc. In this paper, we focus on phrasal
rule extraction (i.e., phrase pair extraction), upon
which most other extraction procedures are based.

Given a sentence pair (e, f), phrasal rule extrac-
tion defines a mapping from a set of word-to-word

Figure 2: Examples of two types of possible align-
ment links (striped). These types account for 96%
of the possible alignment links in our data set.

alignment links A = {(i, j)} to an extraction set
of bispans Rn(A) = {[g, h) ⇔ [k, `)}, where
each bispan links target span [g, h) to source span
[k, `).1 The maximum phrase length n ensures that
max(h− g, `− k) ≤ n.

We can describe this mapping via word-to-
phrase projections, as illustrated in Figure 1. Let
word ei project to the phrasal span σ(ei), where

σ(ei) =
[

min
j∈Ji

j , max
j∈Ji

j + 1
)

(1)

Ji = {j : (i, j) ∈ A}

and likewise each word fj projects to a span of e.
Then, Rn(A) includes a bispan [g, h)⇔ [k, `) iff

σ(ei) ⊆ [k, `) ∀i ∈ [g, h)
σ(fj) ⊆ [g, h) ∀j ∈ [k, `)

That is, every word in one of the phrasal spans
must project within the other. This mapping is de-
terministic, and so we can interpret a word-level
alignment A as also specifying the phrasal rules
that should be extracted from a sentence pair.

2.2 Possible and Null Alignment Links
We have not yet accounted for two special cases
in annotated corpora: possible alignments and null
alignments. To analyze these annotations, we con-
sider a particular data set: a hand-aligned portion

1We use the fencepost indexing scheme used commonly
for parsing. Words are 0-indexed. Spans are inclusive on the
lower bound and exclusive on the upper bound. For example,
the span [0, 2) includes the first two words of a sentence.

of the NIST MT02 Chinese-to-English test set,
which has been used in previous alignment experi-
ments (Ayan et al., 2005; DeNero and Klein, 2007;
Haghighi et al., 2009).

Possible links account for 22% of all alignment
links in these data, and we found that most of
these links fall into two categories. First, possible
links are used to align function words that have no
equivalent in the other language, but colocate with
aligned content words, such as English determin-
ers. Second, they are used to mark pairs of words
or short phrases that are not lexical equivalents,
but which play equivalent roles in each sentence.
Figure 2 shows examples of these two use cases,
along with their corpus frequencies.2

On the other hand, null alignments are used
sparingly in our annotated data. More than 90%
of words participate in some alignment link. The
unaligned words typically express content in one
sentence that is absent in its translation.

Figure 3 illustrates how we interpret possible
and null links in our projection. Possible links are
typically not included in extraction procedures be-
cause most aligners predict only sure links. How-
ever, we see a natural interpretation for possible
links in rule extraction: they license phrasal rules
that both include and exclude them. We exclude
null alignments from extracted phrases because
they often indicate a mismatch in content.

We achieve these effects by redefining the pro-
jection operator σ. Let A(s) be the subset of A
that are sure links, then let the index set Ji used
for projection σ in Equation 1 be

Ji =


{
j : (i, j) ∈ A(s)

}
if ∃j : (i, j) ∈ A(s)

{−1, |f|} if @j : (i, j) ∈ A
{j : (i, j) ∈ A} otherwise

Here, Ji is a set of integers, and σ(ei) for null
aligned ei will be [−1, |f|+ 1) by Equation 1.

Of course, the characteristics of our aligned cor-
pus may not hold for other annotated corpora or
other language pairs. However, we hope that the
overall effectiveness of our modeling approach
will influence future annotation efforts to build
corpora that are consistent with this interpretation.

2.3 A Linear Model of Extraction Sets
We now define a linear model that scores extrac-
tion sets. We restrict our model to score only co-

link types ourselves on a sample of the hand-aligned data set.

Figure 3: Possible links constrain the word-to-
phrase projection of otherwise unaligned words,
which in turn license overlapping phrases. In this
example, σ(f2) = [1, 2) does not include the
possible link at (1, 0) because of the sure link at
(1, 1), but σ(e1) = [1, 2) does use the possible
link because it would otherwise be unaligned. The
word “PDT” is null aligned, and so its projection
σ(e4) = [−1, 4) extends beyond the bounds of the
sentence, excluding “PDT” from all phrase pairs.

herent extraction sets Rn(A), those that are li-
censed by an underlying word alignment A with
sure alignments A(s) ⊆ A. Conditioned on a
sentence pair (e, f) and maximum phrase length
n, we score extraction sets via a feature vec-
tor φ(A(s), Rn(A)) that includes features on sure
links (i, j) ∈ A(s) and features on the bispans in
Rn(A) that link [g, h) in e to [k, `) in f :

φ(A(s), Rn(A)) =∑
(i,j)∈A(s)

φa(i, j) +
∑

[g,h)⇔[k,`)∈Rn(A)

φb(g, h, k, `)

Because the projection operator Rn(·) is a
deterministic function, we can abbreviate
φ(A(s), Rn(A)) as φ(A) without loss of infor-
mation, although we emphasize that A is a set
of sure and possible alignments, and φ(A) does
not decompose as a sum of vectors on individual
word-level alignment links. Our model is param-
eterized by a weight vector θ, which scores an
extraction set Rn(A) as θ · φ(A).

To further limit the space of extraction sets we
are willing to consider, we restrict A to block
inverse transduction grammar (ITG) alignments,
a space that allows many-to-many alignments
through phrasal terminal productions, but other-
wise enforces at-most-one-to-one phrase match-
ings with ITG reordering patterns (Cherry and Lin,
2007; Zhang et al., 2008). The ITG constraint

Figure 4: Above, we show a representative sub-
set of the block alignment patterns that serve as

ductions cover up to n = 3 words in each sentence

is more computationally convenient than arbitrar-
ily ordered phrase matchings (Wu, 1997; DeNero
and Klein, 2008). However, the space of block
ITG alignments is expressive enough to include
the vast majority of patterns observed in hand-
annotated parallel corpora (Haghighi et al., 2009).

In summary, our model scores all Rn(A) for
A ∈ ITG(e, f) where A can include block termi-
nals of size up to n. In our experiments, n = 3.
Unlike previous work, we allow possible align-
ment links to appear in the block terminals, as de-
picted in Figure 4.

3 Model Estimation

We estimate the weights θ of our extraction set
model discriminatively using the margin-infused
relaxed algorithm (MIRA) of Crammer and Singer
(2003)—a large-margin, perceptron-style, online
learning algorithm. MIRA has been used suc-
cessfully in MT to estimate both alignment mod-
els (Haghighi et al., 2009) and translation models
(Chiang et al., 2008).

For each training example, MIRA requires that
we find the alignment Am corresponding to the
highest scoring extraction set Rn(Am) under the
current model,

Am = arg maxA∈ITG(e,f)θ · φ(A) (2)

Section 4 describes our approach to solving this
search problem for model inference.

MIRA updates away from Rn(Am) and to-
ward a gold extraction set Rn(Ag). Some hand-
annotated alignments are outside of the block ITG

model class. Hence, we update toward the ex-
traction set for a pseudo-gold alignment Ag ∈
ITG(e, f) with minimal distance from the true ref-
erence alignment At.

Ag = arg minA∈ITG(e,f)|A ∪ At −A ∩At| (3)

Inference details appear in Section 4.3.
GivenAg andAm, we update the model param-

eters away from Am and toward Ag.

θ ← θ + τ · (φ(Ag)− φ(Am))

where τ is the minimal step size that will ensure
we prefer Ag to Am by a margin greater than
the loss L(Am;Ag), capped at some maximum
update size C to provide regularization. We use
C = 0.01 in experiments. The step size is a closed
form function of the loss and feature vectors: τ =

min
(

C,
L(Am;Ag)− θ · (φ(Ag)− φ(Am))

||φ(Ag)− φ(Am)||22

)
We train the model for 30 iterations over the

training set, shuffling the order each time, and we
average the weight vectors observed after each it-
eration to estimate our final model.

3.1 Extraction Set Loss Function
In order to focus learning on predicting the
right bispans, we use an extraction-level loss
L(Am;Ag): an F-measure of the overlap between
bispans in Rn(Am) and Rn(Ag). This measure
has been proposed previously to evaluate align-
ment systems (Ayan and Dorr, 2006). Based
on preliminary translation results during develop-
ment, we chose bispan F5 as our loss:

Pr(Am) = |Rn(Am) ∩Rn(Ag)|/|Rn(Am)|
Rc(Am) = |Rn(Am) ∩Rn(Ag)|/|Rn(Ag)|

F5(Am;Ag) =
(1 + 52) · Pr(Am) · Rc(Am)

52 · Pr(Am) + Rc(Am)
L(Am;Ag) = 1− F5(Am;Ag)

F5 favors recall over precision. Previous align-
ment work has shown improvements from adjust-
ing the F-measure parameter (Fraser and Marcu,
2006). In particular, Lacoste-Julien et al. (2006)
also chose a recall-biased objective.

Optimizing for a bispan F-measure penalizes
alignment mistakes in proportion to their rule ex-
traction consequences. That is, adding a word
link that prevents the extraction of many correct
phrasal rules, or which licenses many incorrect
rules, is strongly discouraged by this loss.

1456



3.2 Features on Extraction Sets

The discriminative power of our model is driven
by the features on sure word alignment links
φa(i, j) and bispans φb(g, h, k, `). In both cases,
the most important features come from the pre-
dictions of unsupervised models trained on large
parallel corpora, which provide frequency and co-
occurrence information.

To score word-to-word links, we use the poste-
rior predictions of a jointly trained HMM align-
ment model (Liang et al., 2006). The remaining
features include a dictionary feature, an identical
word feature, an absolute position distortion fea-
ture, and features for numbers and punctuation.

To score phrasal translation rules in an extrac-
tion set, we use a mixture of feature types. Ex-
traction set models allow us to incorporate the
same phrasal relative frequency statistics that drive
phrase-based translation performance (Koehn et
al., 2003). To implement these frequency features,
we extract a phrase table from the alignment pre-
dictions of a jointly trained unsupervised HMM
model using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and score
bispans using the resulting features. We also in-
clude indicator features on lexical templates for
the 50 most common words in each language, as
in Haghighi et al. (2009). We include indicators
for the number of words and Chinese characters
in rules. One useful indicator feature exploits the
fact that capitalized terms in English tend to align
to Chinese words with three or more characters.
On 1-by-n or n-by-1 phrasal rules, we include in-
dicator features of fertility for common words.3

We also include monolingual phrase features
that expose useful information to the model. For
instance, English bigrams beginning with “the”
are often extractable phrases. English trigrams
with a hyphen as the second word are typically ex-
tractable, meaning that the first and third words
align to consecutive Chinese words. When any
conjugation of the word “to be” is followed by a
verb, indicating passive voice or progressive tense,
the two words tend to align together.

Our feature set also includes bias features on
phrasal rules and links, which control the num-
ber of null-aligned words and number of rules li-
censed. In total, our final model includes 4,249
individual features, dominated by various instanti-
ations of lexical templates.

3Limiting lexicalized features to common words helps
prevent overfitting.

4 Model Inference

Equation 2 asks for the highest scoring extraction
set under our model, Rn(Am), which we also re-
quire at test time. Although we have restricted
Am ∈ ITG(e, f), our extraction set model does not
factor over ITG productions, and so the dynamic
program for a vanilla block ITG will not suffice to
find Rn(Am). To see this, consider the extraction
set in Figure 5. An ITG decomposition of the un-
derlying alignment imposes a hierarchical brack-
eting on each sentence, and some bispan in the ex-
traction set for this alignment will cross any such
bracketing. Hence, the score of some licensed bis-
pan will be non-local to the ITG decomposition.

4.1 A Dynamic Program for Extraction Sets
If we treat the maximum phrase length n as a fixed
constant, then we can define a dynamic program to
search the space of extraction sets. An ITG deriva-
tion for some alignment A decomposes into two
sub-derivations forAL andAR.4 The model score
of A, which scores extraction set Rn(A), decom-
poses over AL and AR, along with any phrasal
bispans licensed by adjoining AL and AR.

θ · φ(A) = θ · φ(AL) + θ · φ(AR) + I(AL,AR)

where I(AL,AR) is θ ·
∑

φ(g, h, k, l) summed
over licensed bispans [g, h) ⇔ [k, `) that overlap
the boundary between AL and AR.5

4We abuse notation in conflating an alignment A with its
derivation. All derivations of the same alignment receive the
same score, and we only compute the max, not the sum.

5We focus on the case of adjoining two aligned bispans.
Our algorithm easily extends to include null alignments, but
we focus on the non-null setting for simplicity.

Figure 6: Augmenting the ITG grammar states
with the alignment configuration in an n− 1 deep
perimeter of the bispan allows us to score all over-
lapping phrasal rules introduced by adjoining two
bispans. The state must encode whether a sure link
appears in each edge column or row, but the spe-
cific location of edge links is not required.

In order to compute I(AL,AR), we need cer-
tain information about the alignment configura-
tions of AL and AR where they adjoin at a corner.
The state must represent (a) the specific alignment
links in the n − 1 deep corner of each A, and (b)
whether any sure alignments appear in the rows or
columns extending from those corners.6 With this
information, we can infer the bispans licensed by
adjoining AL and AR, as in Figure 6.

Applying our score recurrence yields a
polynomial-time dynamic program. This dynamic
program is an instance of ITG bitext parsing,
where the grammar uses symbols to encode
the alignment contexts described above. This
context-as-symbol augmentation of the grammar
is similar in character to augmenting symbols with
lexical items to score language models during
hierarchical decoding (Chiang, 2007).

4.2 Coarse-to-Fine Inference and Pruning

Exhaustive inference under an ITG requires O(k6)
time in sentence length k, and is prohibitively slow
when there is no sparsity in the grammar. Main-
taining the context necessary to score non-local
bispans further increases running time. That is,
ITG inference is organized around search states
associated with a grammar symbol and a bispan;
augmenting grammar symbols also augments this
state space.

To parse quickly, we prune away search states
using predictions from the more efficient HMM

6The number of configuration states does not depend on
the size ofA because corners have fixed size, and because the
position of links within rows or columns is not needed.

alignment model (Ney and Vogel, 1996). We dis-
card all states corresponding to bispans that are
incompatible with 3 or more alignment links un-
der an intersected HMM—a proven approach to
pruning the space of ITG alignments (Zhang and
Gildea, 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009). Pruning in
this way reduces the search space dramatically, but
only rarely prohibits correct alignments. The ora-
cle alignment error rate for the block ITG model
class is 1.4%; the oracle alignment error rate for
this pruned subset of ITG is 2.0%.

To take advantage of the sparsity that results
from pruning, we use an agenda-based parser that
orders search states from small to large, where we
define the size of a bispan as the total number of
words contained within it. For each size, we main-
tain a separate agenda. Only when the agenda for
size k is exhausted does the parser proceed to pro-
cess the agenda for size k + 1.

We also employ coarse-to-fine search to speed
up inference (Charniak and Caraballo, 1998). In
the coarse pass, we search over the space of ITG
alignments, but score only features on alignment
links and bispans that are local to terminal blocks.
This simplification eliminates the need to augment
grammar symbols, and so we can exhaustively ex-
plore the (pruned) space. We then compute out-
side scores for bispans under a max-sum semir-
ing (Goodman, 1996). In the fine pass with the
full extraction set model, we impose a maximum
size of 10,000 for each agenda. We order states on
agendas by the sum of their inside score under the
full model and the outside score computed in the
coarse pass, pruning all states not within the fixed
agenda beam size.

Search states that are popped off agendas are
indexed by their corner locations for fast look-
up when constructing new states. For each cor-
ner and size combination, built states are main-
tained in sorted order according to their inside
score. This ordering allows us to stop combin-
ing states early when the results are falling off the
agenda beams. Similar search and beaming strate-
gies appear in many decoders for machine trans-
lation (Huang and Chiang, 2007; Koehn and Had-
dow, 2009; Moore and Quirk, 2007).

Figure 7: A* search for pseudo-gold ITG align-
ments uses an admissible heuristic for bispans that
counts the number of gold links outside of [k, `)
but within [g, h). Above, the heuristic is 1, which
is also the minimal number of alignment errors
that an ITG alignment will incur using this bispan.

Ag using A* bitext parsing (Klein and Manning,
2003). Search states, which correspond to bispans
[g, h)⇔ [k, `), are scored by the number of errors
within the bispan plus the number of (i, j) ∈ At
such that j ∈ [k, `) but i /∈ [g, h) (recall errors).
As an admissible heuristic for the future cost of
a bispan [g, h) ⇔ [k, `), we count the number of
(i, j) ∈ At such that i ∈ [g, h) but j /∈ [k, `), as
depicted in Figure 7. These links will become re-
call errors eventually. A* search with this heuristic
makes no errors, and the time required to compute
pseudo-gold alignments is negligible.

5 Relationship to Previous Work

Our model is certainly not the first alignment ap-
proach to include structures larger than words.
Model-based phrase-to-phrase alignment was pro-
posed early in the history of phrase-based trans-
lation as a method for training translation models
(Marcu and Wong, 2002). A variety of unsuper-
vised models refined this initial work with priors
(DeNero et al., 2008; Blunsom et al., 2009) and
inference constraints (DeNero et al., 2006; Birch
et al., 2006; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al.,
2008). These models fundamentally differ from
ours in that they stipulate a segmentation of the
sentence pair into phrases, and only align the min-
imal phrases in that segmentation. Our model
scores the larger overlapping phrases that result
from composing these minimal phrases.

Discriminative alignment is also a well-

explored area. Most work has focused on pre-
dicting word alignments via partial matching in-
ference algorithms (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al.,
2005; Moore, 2005; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006).
Work in semi-supervised estimation has also con-
tributed evidence that hand-annotations are useful
for training alignment models (Fraser and Marcu,
2006; Fraser and Marcu, 2007). The ITG gram-
mar formalism, the corresponding word alignment
class, and inference procedures for the class have
also been explored extensively (Wu, 1997; Zhang
and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang
et al., 2008). At the intersection of these lines of
work, discriminative ITG models have also been
proposed, including one-to-one alignment mod-
els (Cherry and Lin, 2006) and block models
(Haghighi et al., 2009). Our model directly ex-
tends this research agenda with first-class possi-
ble links, overlapping phrasal rule features, and an
extraction-level loss function.

Kääriäinen (2009) trains a translation model
discriminatively using features on overlapping
phrase pairs. That work differs from ours in
that it uses fixed word alignments and focuses on
translation model estimation, while we focus on
alignment and translate using standard relative fre-
quency estimators.

Deng and Zhou (2009) present an alignment
combination technique that uses phrasal features.
Our approach differs in two ways. First, their ap-
proach is tightly coupled to the input alignments,
while we perform a full search over the space of
ITG alignments. Also, their approach uses greedy
search, while our search is optimal aside from
pruning and beaming. Despite these differences,
their strong results reinforce our claim that phrase-
level information is useful for alignment.

6 Experiments

We evaluate our extraction set model by the bis-
pans it predicts, the word alignments it generates,
and the translations generated by two end-to-end
systems. Table 1 compares the five systems de-
scribed below, including three baselines. All su-
pervised aligners were optimized for bispan F5.

Unsupervised Baseline: GIZA++. We trained
GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) using the default
parameters included with the Moses training script
(Koehn et al., 2007). The designated regimen con-
cludes by Viterbi aligning under Model 4 in both
directions. We combined these alignments with

1459



the grow-diag heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).

Unsupervised Baseline: Joint HMM. We
trained and combined two HMM alignment mod-
els (Ney and Vogel, 1996) using the Berkeley
Aligner.7 We initialized the HMM model pa-
rameters with jointly trained Model 1 param-
eters (Liang et al., 2006), combined word-to-
word posteriors by averaging (soft union), and de-
coded with the competitive thresholding heuristic
of DeNero and Klein (2007), yielding a state-of-
the-art unsupervised baseline.

Supervised Baseline: Block ITG. We discrimi-
natively trained a block ITG aligner with only sure
links, using block terminal productions up to 3
words by 3 words in size. This supervised base-
line is a reimplementation of the MIRA-trained
model of Haghighi et al. (2009). We use the same
features and parser implementation for this model
as we do for our extraction set model to ensure a
clean comparison. To remain within the alignment
class, MIRA updates this model toward a pseudo-
gold alignment with only sure links. This model
does not score any overlapping bispans.

Extraction Set Coarse Pass. We add possible
links to the output of the block ITG model by
adding the mixed terminal block productions de-
scribed in Section 2.3. This model scores over-
lapping phrasal rules contained within terminal
blocks that result from including or excluding pos-
sible links. However, this model does not score
bispans that cross bracketing of ITG derivations.

Full Extraction Set Model. Our full model in-
cludes possible links and features on extraction
sets for phrasal bispans with a maximum size of
3. Model inference is performed using the coarse-
to-fine scheme described in Section 4.2.

6.1 Data

In this paper, we focus exclusively on Chinese-to-
English translation. We performed our discrimi-
native training and alignment evaluations using a
hand-aligned portion of the NIST MT02 test set,
which consists of 150 training and 191 test sen-
tences (Ayan and Dorr, 2006). We trained the
baseline HMM on 11.3 million words of FBIS
newswire data, a comparable dataset to those used
in previous alignment evaluations on our test set
(DeNero and Klein, 2007; Haghighi et al., 2009).

7http://code.google.com/p/berkeleyaligner

Our end-to-end translation experiments were
tuned and evaluated on sentences up to length 40
from the NIST MT04 and MT05 test sets. For
these experiments, we trained on a 22.1 million
word parallel corpus consisting of sentences up to
length 40 of newswire data from the GALE pro-
gram, subsampled from a larger data set to pro-
mote overlap with the tune and test sets. This cor-
pus also includes a bilingual dictionary. To im-
prove performance, we retrained our aligner on a
retokenized version of the hand-annotated data to
match the tokenization of our corpus.8 We trained
a language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing
on 262 million words of newswire using SRILM
(Stolcke, 2002).

6.2 Word and Phrase Alignment

The first panel of Table 1 gives a word-level eval-
uation of all five aligners. We use the alignment
error rate (AER) measure: precision is the frac-
tion of sure links in the system output that are sure
or possible in the reference, and recall is the frac-
tion of sure links in the reference that the system
outputs as sure. For this evaluation, possible links
produced by our extraction set models are ignored.
The full extraction set model performs the best by
a small margin, although it was not tuned for word
alignment.

The second panel gives a phrasal rule-level
evaluation, which measures the degree to which
these aligners matched the extraction sets of hand-
annotated alignments, R3(At).9 To compete
fairly, all models were evaluated on the full ex-
traction sets induced by the word alignments they
predicted. Again, the extraction set model outper-
formed the baselines, particularly on the F5 mea-
sure for which these systems were trained.

Our coarse pass extraction set model performed
nearly as well as the full model. We believe
these models perform similarly for two reasons.
First, most of the information needed to predict
an extraction set can be inferred from word links
and phrasal rules contained within ITG terminal
productions. Second, the coarse-to-fine inference
may be constraining the full phrasal model to pre-
dict similar output to the coarse model. This simi-
larity persists in translation experiments.

8All alignment results are reported under the annotated
data set’s original tokenization.

9While pseudo-gold approximations to the annotation
were used for training, the evaluation is always performed
relative to the original human annotation.

Table 1: Experimental results demonstrate that the full extraction set model outperforms supervised and
unsupervised baselines in evaluations of word alignment quality, extraction set quality, and translation.
In word and bispan evaluations, GIZA++ did not have access to a dictionary while all other methods
did. In the BLEU evaluation, all systems used a bilingual dictionary included in the training corpus. The
BLEU evaluation of supervised systems also included rule counts from the Joint HMM to compensate
for parse failures.

6.3 Translation Experiments

We evaluate the alignments predicted by our
model using two publicly available, open-source,
state-of-the-art translation systems. Moses is a
phrase-based system with lexicalized reordering
(Koehn et al., 2007). Joshua (Li et al., 2009) is
an implementation of Hiero (Chiang, 2007) using
a suffix-array-based grammar extraction approach
(Lopez, 2007).

Both of these systems take word alignments as
input, and neither of these systems accepts possi-
ble links in the alignments they consume. To inter-
face with our extraction set models, we produced
three sets of sure-only alignments from our model
predictions: one that omitted possible links, one
that converted all possible links to sure links, and
one that includes each possible link with 0.5 prob-
ability. These three sets were aggregated and rules
were extracted from all three.

The training set we used for MT experiments
is quite heterogenous and noisy compared to our
alignment test sets, and the supervised aligners
did not handle certain sentence pairs in our par-
allel corpus well. In some cases, pruning based
on consistency with the HMM caused parse fail-
ures, which in turn caused training sentences to be
skipped. To account for these issues, we added
counts of phrasal rules extracted from the baseline
HMM to the counts produced by supervised align-
ers.

In Moses, our extraction set model predicts the
set of phrases extracted by the system, and so the
estimation techniques for the alignment model and
translation model both share a common underly-
ing representation: extraction sets. Empirically,
we observe a BLEU score improvement of 1.2

over the best unsupervised baseline and 0.8 over
the block ITG supervised baseline (Papineni et al.,
2002).

In Joshua, hierarchical rule extraction is based
upon phrasal rule extraction, but abstracts away
sub-phrases to create a grammar. Hence, the ex-
traction sets we predict are closely linked to the
representation that this system uses to translate.
The extraction model again outperformed both un-
supervised and supervised baselines, by 1.4 BLEU
and 1.2 BLEU respectively.

7 Conclusion

Our extraction set model serves to coordinate the
alignment and translation model components of a
statistical translation system by unifying their rep-
resentations. Moreover, our model provides an ef-
fective alternative to phrase alignment models that
choose a particular phrase segmentation; instead,
we predict many overlapping phrases, both large
and small, that are mutually consistent. In future
work, we look forward to developing extraction
set models for richer formalisms, including hier-
archical grammars.
