Abstract 

Pedagogical materials frequently contain 
deixis to communicative artifacts such as 
textual structures (e.g., sections and lists), 
discourse entities, and illustrations. By 
relating such artifacts to the prose, deixis plays 
an essential role in structuring the flow of 
information in informative writing. However, 
existing language technologies have largely 
overlooked this mechanism. We examine 
properties of deixis to communicative artifacts 
using a corpus rich in determiner-established 
instances of the phenomenon (e.g., “this 
section”, “these equations”, “those reasons”) 
from Wikibooks, a collection of learning texts. 
We use this corpus in combination with 
WordNet to determine a set of word senses 
that are characteristic of the phenomenon, 
showing its diversity and validating intuitions 
about its qualities. The results motivate further 
research to extract the connections encoded by 
such deixis, with the goals of enhancing tools 
to present pedagogical e-texts to readers and, 
more broadly, improving language 
technologies that rely on deictic phenomena. 

1 Introduction 
Deixis often appears in written language as an 
anaphoric mechanism to refer to communicative 
entities in a document. Such deixis can have a 
variety of referent types. For example, consider 
that idea in Sentence (1), those names in (2), this 
section in (3), and these figures in (4): 

(1) That idea has been challenged by many.  
(2) Those names are Welsh in origin. 
(3) In this section, we cover some early work. 
(4) Quantities in these figures are approximate. 

The kinds of deixis represented in (1) and (2) are 
similar to discourse deixis (Webber, 1991) and 
textual deixis (Lyons, 1977), respectively. 
Sentence (3) contains deixis to a structural 
element of a document (Paraboni and Deemter, 

2006), and (4) contains an example of deixis to 
illustrative items such as figures or examples. 
We collectively term such deictic acts as 
communicative deixis (CD for brevity), 
recognizing their shared characteristics, and we 
name their referents communicative artifacts 
(CAs). Prior studies have focused on narrow 
varieties of CD (such as those identified above), 
leaving unknown their properties when viewed 
together as a whole. Moreover, efforts to 
automatically identify or resolve CD have been 
piecemeal at best. Given the complexity of the 
referents, conventional tools for coreference or 
anaphora resolution are poorly applicable. 

This paper describes analysis of the first 
collection of instances of deixis in English 
targeted to refer to a broad variety of CAs. Texts 
from the website Wikibooks are used, for the 
intuitive density of CD in pedagogical material 
and the potential value of augmenting them with 
interpretive metadata. The diversity of referents 
in this corpus enables new inferences on the 
composition and relative frequencies of CD 
varieties in text. We focus on determiner-
established instances, i.e., anaphoric noun 
phrases that begin with determiners this, that, 
these, or those (e.g., (1)-(4)). This focus has the 
advantage of collecting instances that explicitly 
identify the relevant capacities of their referents 
(e.g., (1) reifies its referent as an “idea”). 

The remainder of this paper is structured as 
follows. Section 2 surveys related work on deixis 
to specific types of CAs. Section 3 describes the 
text source for this study and the procedure used 
to collect and label instances. Section 4 describes 
our use of WordNet to characterize CAs, 
resulting in an ontology of such referents and 
inter-annotator agreement results for labeling of 
artifact types. Finally, Section 5 provides some 
conclusions and directions for future work.

2 Related Work  
The value of CD in pedagogical contexts has 
been established by studies such as those by 
Mayer (2009) and Buisine and Martin (2007). 
Those motivate our work to fill the present lack 
of corpus-based linguistic knowledge of the 
phenomenon. Also, although spatial deixis falls 
beyond the scope of this paper, we acknowledge 
the efforts of others such as Gergle et al. (2013) 
to study its value in collaborative communication. 

Prior works have examined discourse deixis in 
text, though little attention has been given to CD 
as a phenomenon or deixis to other CAs. Seminal 
papers by Webber (1988, 1991) established the 
importance of discourse deixis, although they 
focused upon demonstrative pronouns such as 
“this” or “that”. Many efforts have addressed 
discourse deixis in the context of anaphora; these 
include Poesio and Artstein’s (2008), who 
created a corpus of anaphoric relations inclusive 
of (but not limited to) discourse. Their collection 
included 455 instances of discourse deixis, 
although they noted ambiguity in the set of 
markables. Dipper and Zinsmeister (2012) also 
addressed discourse deixis through anaphora 
resolution and produced a collection of 225 
abstract anaphors out of 643 candidate instances. 

Prior studies of shell nouns revealed capacities 
of referents similar to a subset of those found in 
our work. Such nouns are used anaphorically to 
refer to complex, proposition-like pieces of 
information such as points, assumptions, or acts 
(Schmid, 2000). Kolhatkar et al. (2013) noted the 
pervasiveness of shell nouns in text and their 
tendency to “characterize and label” their 
antecedents. However, such antecedents only 
partly intersect with CAs. The set of shell nouns 
studied by Schmid did not include typical 
document entities such as section, figure, or list. 
Simultaneously, the set included many nouns 
with little or no relevance as CAs, such as fury, 
miracle, and pride.  

The task of identifying CD in text and referent 
CAs bears some similarity to coreference 
resolution. However, coreference resolvers tried 
by the authors (namely CoreNLP (Recasens et al., 
2013), ArkRef (O’Connor and Heilman, 2013) 
and the work of Roth and Bengston (2008)) were 
ineffective at this task. We posit that many CAs 
are not noun phrases, which makes them difficult 
or inappropriate to characterize as referring 
expressions. This limits the effectiveness of 
traditional approaches to coreference resolution 
toward the present problem. 

 
Our results are further distinct from prior work 

by focusing on the communicative capacities of a 
variety of referents represented in documents. 
However, the present focus upon determiner-
established phrases is more exclusive, and our 
results do not include demarcation of referents. 
We posit that the tradeoff is worthwhile, given 
limited prior work on identifying CD and the 
lack of prior efforts to study CAs other than 
discourse entities. 

3 Corpus Creation  
Textbooks from Wikibooks were chosen to 
supply pedagogical text. Among the alternatives, 
this source provided the largest volume of 
material with a license amenable to corpus 
redistribution. Moreover, the collection of 
English language textbooks on the site covers a 
diverse set of topics and contains samples from a 
variety of writers. Below we describe our text 
pre-processing and then explain how candidate 
instances of CD were identified.  

3.1 Source Material 
To simplify collection and processing, 122 
Wikibooks textbooks with printable versions 
were selected for use. Contained in this set are 
textbooks in eleven different subject areas, such 
as computing, humanities, and the sciences. In 
preparation for analysis, the documents were 
POS tagged and parsed by the Stanford CoreNLP 
suite (Socher et al., 2013; Toutanova et al., 
2003). Table 1 presents some statistics on the 
texts in aggregate. They illustrate the substantial 
size of most texts, though a few were freshly 
started or incomplete. Overall, the corpus is 
comparable in size with corpora from efforts 
cited in Section 2, though text genera and sought 
markables vary. 

Next, potential instances of CD were 
identified. Such instances were noun phrases 
beginning with determiners this, that, these, or 
those. We include these and those to collect CD 
to sets of entities, a nuance absent from any 
previous work. 9252 sentences, or 8% of the 
corpus, contained at least one potential instance.

This collection contained substantial boilerplate 
text, and sentences that appeared verbatim in at 
least ten different books were discarded. This 
filtering produced a set of 7613 candidate 
instances. Table 2 shows the most frequent head 
nouns in candidate instances. Some resemble the 
shell nouns of prior work, but the presence of 
others illustrates the diversity of CD. Diversity 
was expected from pedagogical texts and 
validates Wikibooks as a rich source of CD.   

We conducted a preliminary survey of the 
corpus contents by reading a random selection of 
10% of candidates and judging their statuses as 
instances of CA. Table 3 shows examples of 
candidate instances, categorized by the foci of 
prior studies (cited in the Introduction) of CD 
phenomena. The researchers estimated that 48% 
of candidates were instances of CD, although 
directly labeling large numbers of candidates was 
deemed impractical. Instead, we noted that the 
word sense of the noun in a candidate instance is 
an important (albeit not definitive) indication of 
its CD status. Accordingly, we shift our focus 
from individual candidate instances to words that 
appear in them (i.e., lemmas) and word senses.  

 

3.2 Word Senses 
The noun in an instance of CD has a doubly 
salient role in CA, by providing a cue to the 
intended referent and also by reifying the 
referent. For example, an illustrating referent 
might be referred to as “this example” or “this 
ideal”, with divergent consequences. The noun 
choice semantically identifies the relevant 
capacity of the referent, affecting its message. 

To identify the varieties and characteristics of 
CD in pedagogical text, we examine in aggregate 
the senses of those words that appear in 
candidate phrases in the corpus. WordNet 3.0 
(Fellbaum, 1998) was chosen to provide an 
ontological structure for relevant word senses 
and thus for CAs. First, synsets for the 27 most 
frequent nouns in candidate phrases were 
collected, irrespective of viability for CD. This 
covered 34% of candidate instances and resulted 
in a set of 200 synsets. Their glosses were 
labeled as viable or non-viable for CD by two 
expert annotators, who first worked separately 
and then collaborated to resolve differences in 
their annotations.

Imagine instantiating the type 
represented by the gloss. Judge its 
suitability for the following statements. 

(1) [an instantiation of the type] is 
about a topic. 

(2) [an instantiation of the type] is 
intended to communicate an idea. 

(3) [an instantiation of the type] can 
be produced in a document or as a 
document to convey information. 

If at least two of the three statements 
above are coherent, mark 'y' for the 
gloss. Otherwise, mark 'n'.

Figure 1 shows the annotation instructions, 
which were designed to address the combined 
range of CAs from prior work. To illustrate its 
application, consider the noun chapter. One gloss 
of chapter is “a subdivision of a written work; 
usually numbered and titled”. This sense clearly 
satisfies the third numbered statement in Figure 
1. Coherency arguments for the first and second 
statements are less definitional, but both 
annotators decided at least one was satisfactory, 
leading to a y mark. Another gloss of chapter is 
“any distinct period in history or in a person’s 
life”. This sense fails to satisfy the second or 
third statement, leading to an n mark. 

4 Results and Discussion 
Resolving differences between the annotators’ 
labels produced a set of 62 synsets whose glosses 
characterized CAs. We refer to the sets of 200 
synsets and 62 synsets as the CCS (candidates 
for communicative senses) and VCS (verified  
communicative senses) sets, respectively. We 
offer the complete results of our annotations 
online 1  to encourage further research on this 
topic. In this section we present inter-annotator 
agreement statistics and describe the composition 
of the VCS set using the structure of WordNet. 

4.1 Inter-Annotator Agreement 
The kappa statistic for category agreement 
between the two annotators was 0.70, with 
matching annotations on 174 of 200 senses. 
Although this metric is an imperfect indicator, 
this value is generally regarded as substantial 
(Viera and Garrett, 2005) albeit with some 
tentativeness (Carletta, 1996). The annotators 
respectively placed 33% and 30% of instances in 
the VCS set, suggesting general agreement on 
the distribution of labels irrespective of specific 
instances. The annotators agreed that some cases 
were difficult to label without context, and a 
combination of sense labeling and in-text 
instance labeling may be fruitful for future work. 

4.2 Representation in WordNet 
We use the structure of WordNet to illustrate the 
properties of CAs that VCS senses represent. To 
do this, the hypernym closure (i.e., the 
sequence(s) of hypernyms from a given synset to 
the root synset) was computed for each VCS 
sense. These “traces” were aggregated into a

reproduction of a subset of WordNet’s synsets 
and relations, resulting in a de facto ontology of 
CAs. The same procedure was performed for the 
CCS set to create an illustrative baseline. 

Table 4 shows the structure of the most 
general synsets in the ontologies constructed 
from VCS and CCS traces. Fractions illustrate 
the relative constituent weight of each synset, by 
virtue of the traces that include it. For example, 
65 of the 72 traces for VCS synsets pass through 
abstraction.n.06, and 37 of those 65 traces pass 
through communication.n.02. The total quantities 
of traces for CCS and VCS are greater than their 
respective set sizes because of a small number of 
synsets in those sets with multiple hyponym 
paths to the root. The rightmost column of Table 
4 shows the decimal result of subtracting the 
CCS constituent weight fraction from the VCS 
fraction. Positive numbers indicate that the 
manual labeling of senses magnified the weight 
of a synset over the CCS baseline. 

The constituent weights confirm some 
intuitions but also hold a few surprises. The vast 
majority of CAs are abstractions rather than 
physical entities, and most of the abstractions are 
“something that is communicated by or to or 
between people or groups” (the gloss of 
communication.n.02). Psychological features are 
also a substantial constituency, with traces to 
VCS synsets that represent words such as 
method, plan, and question. Most of the few 
VCS physical entities are communicative 
artifacts in their complete form (e.g., a book or a 
periodical issue). Matter as a physical entity may 
seem out of place in Table 4. The VCS synset 
responsible for its inclusion is page.n.01, which

has the gloss “one side of one leaf (of a book or 
magazine or newspaper or letter etc.) or the 
written or pictorial matter it contains.” Both 
annotators believed it merited inclusion in VCS. 

Finally, we observed that many VCS senses 
(58%) were not the first sense for their words, 
indicating different senses appear more often2. 
This likely hinders word sense disambiguation of 
nouns in CD instances: the common baseline of 
first sense tagging is futile in these cases, and 
their extra-topical nature means that appropriate 
CA senses are not implied by the surrounding 
words (Wilson, 2011). This suggests that 
identification of CD instances may require a 
dedicated approach to word sense tagging. 

5 Conclusion 
The results of this study illustrate the 
significance of CD, both for the processing of 
pedagogical texts and for the broader project of 
understanding anaphora. Its pervasiveness and its 
diversity show its potential as a conduit for 
language technologies to enrich documents with 
pragmatic metadata. Our next effort will be to 
identify the referents of CD instances using 
knowledge from the present study of the 
character and distribution of those referents. CAs 
are represented by spans of content in a 
document (e.g., text or figures), and accordingly 
the identification of a CD referent will involve 
the selection of the correct span of content. We 
expect that the word sense of the noun in a CD 
phrase will limit the set of potentially relevant 
CAs, and that both localized features (such as 
paragraph position of a CD instance and the 
expected CA count) and document-level features 
(e.g., proximity of potential referents) will be 
valuable.
