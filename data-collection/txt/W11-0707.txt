Abstract

We present the AAWD corpus, a collection
of 365 discussions drawn from Wikipedia talk
pages and annotated with labels capturing two
kinds of social acts: alignment moves and au-
thority claims. We describe these social acts
and our annotation process, and analyze the
resulting data set for interactions between par-
ticipant status and social acts and between the
social acts themselves.

1 Introduction

This paper presents a new annotated resource: the
Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Discussions
(AAWD) corpus (available from http://ssli.
ee.washington.edu/projects/SCIL.html).
The AAWD corpus contains discussions from
English-language Wikipedia talk pages extracted
from the 2008 Wikipedia data dump and annotated
for two types of social acts: authority claims and
positive/negative alignment moves. In brief, an
authority claim is a statement made by a discussion
participant aimed at bolstering their credibility in
the discussion. An alignment move is a statement
by a participant which explicitly positions them as
agreeing or disagreeing with another participant or
participants regarding a particular topic.

These annotations are intended to make acces-
sible for automated processing two interesting and
characteristic aspects of interaction in online discus-
sion forums. As a dataset for computational and
sociolinguistic analysis, the discussion pages within
Wikipedia are valuable for several reasons. First, the

interaction among the participants is nearly entirely
captured within the dataset, and all of the “identity-
work” (Bucholtz and Hall, 2010) done by Wikipedia
discussion participants needs to be done directly in
the text of their comments. Furthermore, the discus-
sions tend to be task-driven, focused on the shared
goal of improving the associated article. This leads
the data to be a particularly rich source of linguistic
expressions of authority and alignment.

Our annotations represent a kind of information
which is rather different from that involved in NLP
tasks such as POS tagging, morphological analysis,
parsing and semantic role labeling. Such tasks in-
volve recognizing information that is implicit in the
linguistic signal but nonetheless part of its struc-
ture. Tasks such as named-entity recognition and
word sense disambiguation are also close to the lin-
guistic structure of the signal. Authority claims and
alignment moves, on the other hand, are examples
of communicative moves aimed at social position-
ing of a discussant within a group of participants,
which may be specialized dialog acts but are referred
to here as “social acts.” We distinguish social acts
from “social events” as described in (Agarwal and
Rambow, 2010): social events correspond to types
of interactions among people, whereas a social act
is associated with a fine-grained social goal and re-
flected in the specific choices of words and ortho-
graphic or prosodic cues at the level of a turn.

The primary value of this new data set is in facil-
itating computational modeling of a new task type,
i.e. the identification of fine-grained social acts in
linguistic interaction. While there has been some
prior work on detecting agreements and disagree-

48



ments in multiparty discussions (Hillard et al., 2003;
Galley et al., 2004), which is related to detecting
positive/negative alignment moves, most previous
work on authority bids has involved descriptive stud-
ies, e.g. (Galegher et al., 1998). Computational
modeling of these phenomena and automatic detec-
tion will help with understanding effective argumen-
tation strategies in online discussions and automatic
identification of divisive or controversial discussions
and online trolls. We believe that these tasks also
provide an interesting arena in which to study lin-
guistic feature engineering and feature selection. As
with tasks such as sentiment analysis, a simple “bag-
of-words” model with word or even n-gram-based
features is not sufficiently powerful to detect many
instances of these social acts, where combinations of
positive and negative words must be interpreted in
context, e.g. absolutely is positive alone but ampli-
fies a negative in absolutely not, and yeah in yeah,
I want to correct something John said of course
doesn’t necessarily indicate agreement. The typical
scenario where hand-annotated training data is lim-
ited presents a challenge for learning phrase patterns
that discriminate social acts.

In the remainder of this paper, we further describe
the social acts and annotation schemata (Section 2),
provide details of the AAWD corpus (Section 3),
and analyze the distribution of the social acts (Sec-
tion 4). This analysis describes the distribution of
the social acts and tests hypotheses about their inter-
actions with each other and with user status.

2 Annotation Schemata

2.1 Authority Claims

The ability to persuade others to believe in one’s
statements or the soundness of one’s judgments is
a necessary component of human social interac-
tion. In order to establish the necessary credibil-
ity to secure the belief or assent of others, commu-
nicators will often couch their statements in some
broadly-recognized basis for authority. These “ar-
guments from authority” have been recognized as
an important component of informal logic by many
language philosophers (Liu, 1997), including John
Locke (1959 [1690]). In recent decades the self-
presentation of authority has been studied in a va-
riety of spoken and written contexts by scholars

from disciplines such as communication, rhetoric,
health studies, sociolinguistics, linguistic pragmat-
ics and political science in order to understand the
strategies that communicators operating in differ-
ent genres and media employ to establish them-
selves as credible discursive participants. Studies
of online product reviews (Mackiewicz, 2010), on-
line political deliberation (Jensen, 2003), scientific
publications (Thompson, 1993), online forum posts
(Galegher et al., 1998; Richardson, 2003) and radio
talk-shows (Thornborrow, 2001) have revealed that
considerations of genre, medium and social context
all shape the ways interactants attempt to claim the
authority to be listened to and taken seriously.

From the perspective of discourse analysis, au-
thority claims provide an interesting lens through
which to view a text, as the overall frequency of
claims can reflect the nature or purpose of the dis-
course (e.g. task-oriented collaboration vs. undi-
rected conversation) and the distribution of claim
types can reveal features of the social context in
which they are made, such as shared norms, prac-
tices and community values. For example, since cer-
tain bases for authority may be seen as more credi-
ble than others in certain contexts (such as citation
of peer-reviewed publications in academic scholar-
ship, or references to personal experience in online
support groups), the prevalence and distribution of
different types of claims in a written text or a con-
versation transcript can illuminate the shared values
of speakers and audiences in a given genre (Galegher
et al., 1998). Although the linguistic construction of
authority claims can vary greatly according to the
genre of the communication, within a single genre
there is often great regularity in the ways claims
are made, such as the common I’m a long-time
listener introduction used by radio talk-show call-
in guests. Even across genres, recognizable types
emerge: references to personal credentials (such as
education or profession) are found to be important
in newsgroup messages (Richardson, 2003), product
reviews (Mackiewicz, 2010) and online scientific ar-
ticle comments (Shanahan, 2010).

Our taxonomy of authority claims was itera-
tively developed based on our empirical analysis
of conversational interaction in two different gen-
res: political talk shows and Wikipedia discus-
sion pages (Oxley et al., 2010), with reference to

49



the literature cited above. Our codebook (avail-
able from http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/
projects/SCIL.html) includes detailed defini-
tions as well as positive and negative examples for
each claim type.

We classify authority claims into the following
types (examples are drawn from our data):

Credentials: Credentials claims involve refer-
ence to education, training, or a history of work in
an area. (Ex: Speaking as a native born Midwest-
erner who is also a professional writer. . . )

Experiential: Experiential claims are based on
an individual’s involvement in or witnessing of an
event. (Ex: If I recall correctly, God is mentioned in
civil ceremonies in Snohomish County, Washington,
the only place I’ve witnessed one.)

Institutional: Institutional claims are based on
an individual’s position within an organization struc-
ture that governs the current discussion forum or has
power to affect the topic or direction of the discus-
sion. (Not attested in our corpus.)

Forum: Forum claims are based on policy,
norms, or contextual rules of behavior in the in-
teraction. (Ex: Do any of these meet wikipedia’s
[[WP:RS | Reliable Sources ]] criteria?)

External: External claims are based on an out-
side authority or source of expertise, such as a book,
magazine article, website, written law, press release,
or court decision. (Ex: The treaty of international
law which states that wars have to begin with a
declaration is the Hague Convention relative to the
Opening of Hostilities from 1907.)

Social Expectations: Social Expectations claims
are based on the intentions or expectations (what
they think, feel or believe) of groups or communities
that exist beyond the current conversational context.
(Ex: I think in the minds of most people, including
the government, the word “war” and a formal dec-
laration of war have come apart.)

2.2 Alignment Moves
In multiparty discourse, relationships among par-
ticipants manifest themselves in social moves that
participants make to demonstrate alignment with or
against other participants. Expressing alignment
with another participant functions as a means of
enhancing solidarity with that participant while ex-
pressing alignment against another participant main-

tains social distance between conversational partic-
ipants, particularly in situations where participants
may be previously unacquainted with each other
(Svennevig, 1999). Changes in the alignment of par-
ticipants toward one another or “shifts in footing”
may reflect changes in interpersonal relationships or
may be more transitory, demonstrating minor con-
cessions and critiques embedded within larger, more
stable patterns of participant agreement and dis-
agreement (Goffman, 1981; Wine, 2008).

As Wikipedia editors negotiate about article con-
tent, they make statements that support or oppose
propositions suggested by other editors and thereby
publicly align either with or against other editors in
the discussion. Although ways of expressing agree-
ment and disagreement vary according to power re-
lations between participants, participant goals, and
conversational context (Rees-Miller, 2000), pre-
vious research has suggested that expressions of
agreement and disagreement in written language are
more explicit than oral expressions of agreement and
disagreement (Mulkay, 1985; Mulkay, 1986) and
that statements of agreement are particularly explicit
in online discussions (Baym, 1996).

We classify alignment moves into positive and
negative types, according to whether the participant
is agreeing or disagreeing with the target:

Positive alignment moves express agreement
with the opinions of another participant. Positive
alignment is annotated in cases of explicit agree-
ment, praise/thanking, positive reference to another
participant’s point (e.g. As Joe pointed out. . . ), or
where other clear indicators of positive alignment
are present.

Negative alignment moves express disagreement
with the opinions of another participant. Negative
alignment is annotated in cases of explicit disagree-
ment, doubting, sarcastic praise, criticism/insult,
dismissing, or where other clear indicators of neg-
ative alignment (such as typographical cues) are
present.

Based on our experience using the types of au-
thority claims to diagnose and correct sources of
inter-annotator disagreement (see §3.3 below), we
developed subtypes of positive and negative align-
ment. While these do not have the same theoretical
grounding as the types of authority claims, they did
serve the same purpose of improving our annotation

50



over time.
We annotate a target for each alignment move,

which may be one or more specific other parties in
the conversation, the group as the whole, or some-
one outside the conversation. In addition, we in-
clude a category labeled “unclear” for cases where
there is an alignment move, but the annotators are
not able to discern its target. Again, the codebook
includes example subtypes as part of detailed defini-
tions as well as positive and negative examples for
each alignment type.

3 The Corpus

3.1 Source Data

Wikipedia talk pages (also called discussion pages)
are editable pages on which editors can take part in
threaded, asynchronous discussions about the con-
tent of other pages. All editors potentially interested
in a given article can join the conversation on that
article’s talk page. Sometimes these conversations
take the form of a deliberative exchange or even a
heated argument as editors advocate different ideas
about such things as the content or form of an ar-
ticle. Each edit to the talk pages is recorded as a
unique revision in the system and thus becomes part
of the permanent record of system activity.

Wikipedia constitutes a particularly valuable nat-
ural laboratory for studies such as this one, for
several reasons. First, the interaction among the
participants is almost entirely captured within the
Wikipedia database: while some Wikipedians might
interact with each other in person or in other online
fora (such as IRC or mailing lists), this is the excep-
tion rather than the rule. Furthermore, while partici-
pants often maintain persistent identities (usernames
for registered users; IP addresses for unregistered
ones) there are no cues to social identities available
to the participants beyond what is captured in the
digital record. Therefore all of the effort that partic-
ipants put into constructing their online identities is
in the record for analysis. Second, the discussions
on Wikipedia talk pages tend to be goal-oriented, as
the discussion topic is the Wikipedia article that the
participants are collaboratively editing. This goal-
orientation motivates participants to explicitly align
with each other in the course of discussions and but-
tress their arguments with authority claims. Finally,

the Wikipedia dataset contains rich metadata, such
as the date and time of each edit (identified by re-
vision id) to every article or talk page; the editor
responsible for the edit (identified by username or
IP address, depending on registration status); and
markup such as hyperlinks and formatting used in
the textual content of each edit. These metadata al-
low for sophisticated data analysis at the editor level
(e.g. how many edits made by one editor in a given
span of time) and the page level (e.g. how many ed-
itors have participated in a talk page discussion).

The Wikimedia Foundation frequently releases
the database dump of the Wikipedia pages in the
form of XML (available at http://download.
wikimedia.org). The database dumps are cate-
gorized into languages, and for each language, there
are XML files corresponding to different levels of
detail in terms of the information they contain. To
get the information on all revisions, we used the
largest database dump, which contains all Wikipedia
pages and complete edit history. The XML file was
parsed and a database created locally with all the
revision information for both main pages and talk
pages. We then constructed queries to retrieve the
main pages and corresponding talk pages based on
a list of topics for which extensive discussions are
likely to occur.

Our data is drawn from a set of 365 discussions
from 47 talk pages. The discussions were selected
to contain at least 5 turns and at least 4 human par-
ticipants.1 The earliest edit in our data set is from
January 29, 2002 and the latest is from January 6,
2008. A total of 1,509 editors collectively make
6,066 turns in this data. Of the 365 discussions,
185 were annotated for both alignment moves and
authority claims. An additional 26 were annotated
for alignment only and an additional 154 were an-
notated for authority only. The numbers of editors
and turns in these sets are shown in Table 1.

3.2 Annotation Units

A Wikipedia talk page is in itself a wiki-style docu-
ment. Thus, each modification to a talk page by an
editor can modify multiple sections of the page. We
define a “turn” as a contiguous body of text on the

1Wikipedia discussions may also include contributions by
automated “bots”.

corresponding page that was modified as part of a
single revision. Thus, a single revision may result in
multiple turns being added. Each turn may include
one or more paragraphs of text, either existing but
modified, or new additions. We annotated authority
claims at the paragraph level and alignment moves at
the turn level. The larger unit is used for alignment
moves because the phenomenon as defined can span
a larger section of text.

The annotation tool (a modified version of LDC’s
XTrans (Glenn et al., 2009)) allowed annotators to
indicate the presence and type of claims or moves in
each annotation unit, in addition to selecting spans
of text corresponding to each social act. For align-
ment moves, within a turn, alignment of the same
type (positive or negative) with the same target was
annotated as a single alignment move, even across
multiple sentences. Where the type or target dif-
fered, we annotated up to three separate alignment
moves per annotation unit. For authority claims, we
also annotated up to three claims per annotation unit,
with each claim identified by a single span of text.
Claims in separate sentences of an annotation unit
counted as separate even if they were of the same
type. Figure 1 gives an example from our codebook
of a turn with multiple alignment moves.

3.3 Annotation Process
Each discussion thread was annotated independently
by two or more annotators. Inter-annotator agree-
ment was calculated at weekly intervals to assess
annotation progress and identify areas of disagree-
ment. Adjudicators also performed “spot checks” of
annotated data weekly and provided feedback when
there were disagreements among annotators or when
codes seemed to be inconsistently or erroneously ap-
plied. The codebooks for authority claims and align-
ment moves were also iteratively refined with the ad-
dition of positive and negative examples and specific

linguistic cues commonly associated with particular
move or claim types based on spot-check results and
annotator feedback.

Two strategies that proved useful in maintaining
consistency in the frequency and reliability of cod-
ing across annotators were the computation of av-
erage agreement and comparison of overall counts
of each codable unit on a weekly basis. Comput-
ing average agreement allowed adjudicators to iden-
tify particular categories that were proving espe-
cially difficult to code consistently, and to better fo-
cus their efforts on re-training annotators and up-
dating the relevant sections of the annotation guide-
lines. Comparing counts of the number of times two
annotators had coded a particular category over the
same number of discussions also proved useful for
identifying potential problems with under- or over-
coding of a category by a particular annotator.

3.4 Reconciliation
The manual annotation process was completed in-
dependently by each annotator, resulting in multiple
sets of labels. To create a single copy of the data that
can be used in learning experiments, an algorithm
was designed to merge the annotations into a single,
“master” version. The algorithm balances annota-
tion consistency and simplicity of the merging pro-
cess. We treat the annotations for each unit in a file
as a set with respect to type: Multiple labels of the
same type are treated as a single label for purposes
of reconciliation, with only one label of each type
allowed for each annotation unit.

We mark each social act which had been identi-
fied by at least two annotators as having “high con-
fidence.” If a social act was identified by only one
annotator in that annotation unit, it is marked as hav-
ing “low confidence.” This procedure yields two sets
of social act types found in each annotation unit, one
consisting of the high confidence labels, and another
of the low confidence labels. The labels from each
set are kept distinct, i.e. for each label in the high
confidence set, the corresponding label in the low
confidence set has the suffix “ single” appended to
the high confidence label.

Aggregated social act labels are propagated to
the sentence level by using a dynamic program-
ming algorithm to match sentences (determined by
automatic segmentation) with the keyword spans

based on overlap. A sentence could have multi-
ple positive labels if one or more annotators la-
beled it for different types in the high or low con-
fidence set. Sentences in turns with a marked
social act but not aligned to text spans are la-
beled as “unused” due to the ambiguity associated
with a limit on the number of social acts anno-
tated per unit. All sentences in an annotation unit
for which no annotator found any positive labels
are labeled with the negative class. The data dis-
tributed at http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/
projects/SCIL.html include both the underly-
ing per-annotator files as well as the files output by
the reconciliation process.

3.5 Annotation Quality
In complicated annotation tasks, such as those con-
ducted in this work, establishing reliable ground
truth is a fundamental challenge. The most popular
approach to measuring annotation quality is via the
surrogate of annotation consistency. This assumes
that when annotators working independently arrive
at the same decisions they have correctly carried out
the task specified by the annotation guidelines. Sev-
eral quantitative measures of annotator consistency
have been proposed and debated over the years (Art-
stein and Poesio, 2008). We use the well-known
Cohen’s kappa coefficient κ, which accounts for un-
even class priors, so one may obtain a low agreement
score even when a high percentage of tokens have
the same label. We also report the percentage of in-
stances on which the annotators agreed, A, which
includes agreement on the absence of a particular
label. When a set of instances have been labeled by
more than two annotators, we compute the average
of pairwise agreement.

Scores for authority claim and alignment move
agreement are presented in Tables 2 and 3.2 For

pearing in only three labels. This is not sufficient for proper κ

authority, the most common types of claims, forum
and external, are also two of the most reliably identi-
fied. For alignment, the positive type has much bet-
ter agreement scores than the negative type. Inter-
estingly, it appears that the fine distinctions between
the types of negative alignment move are a large fac-
tor in the low agreement scores. When all of the
negative categories are merged, agreement is higher,
although still less than for positive alignment moves.

Our κ values generally fall within the range that
Landis and Koch (1977) deem “moderate agree-
ment”, but below the .8 cut-off tentatively suggested

computation, and so we do not include them in Table 3.

53



by Artstein and Poesio (2008).3 One possible rea-
son is that the negative class is not as discrete as it
might be in other tasks: both alignment moves and
authority claims can be more or less subtle or ex-
plicit. We have designed our annotation guidelines
to emphasize the more explicit variants of each, but
the same guidelines can sometimes lead annotators
to pick up more subtle examples that other annota-
tors might not feel meet the strict definitions in the
guidelines. Thus we expect our “high-confidence”
labels to correspond to the more blatant examples
and the “low-confidence” labels, while sometimes
being genuine noise, to pick out more subtle exam-
ples.

4 Analysis

While the main goal of this paper is to document
the AAWD corpus, we also performed several sta-
tistical analyses of authority and alignment, in or-
der to demonstrate the relevance of these social acts
as markers of user identity and social dynamics
within our corpus. In this section we present the
overall distribution of authority claims and align-
ment moves, compare the prevalence of authority
claims across user types, and show how a partici-
pant’s claim-making behavior may affect how others
subsequently align with them. In doing so, we con-
sider only high-confidence labels from files which
were annotated by at least two annotators. This sub-
set includes 186 discussions annotated for alignment
moves and 200 discussions annotated for authority
claims. Of those, 149 discussions were annotated
for both types of social acts.

4.1 Distribution of Social Acts

We find that 25% of the turns in our alignment data
contain alignment moves and 21% of the turns in our
authority data contain authority claims. In addition,
35% and 32% of the editors in each set make align-
ment moves and authority claims, respectively. The
breakdown by alignment move and authority claim
type is given in Table 4. Note that any given turn
might contain both positive and negative alignment
moves or multiple types of authority claims.

3Artstein and Poesio also note that it may not make sense to
have only one threshold for the field.

4.2 Authority Claim Types by User Status
Wikipedia distinguishes three different statuses: un-
registered users (able to perform most editing activ-
ities, identified only by IP address), registered users
(able to perform more editing activities, edits at-
tributed to a consistent user name) and administra-
tors (registered users with additional ‘sysop’ privi-
leges). Participants of different statuses tend to do
different kinds of work on Wikipedia, with admin-
istrators in particular being more likely to take on
moderator work (Burke and Kraut, 2008), such as
mediating and diffusing disputes among editors. Be-
cause conflict mediation requires a different kind of
credibility than collaborative writing work, and be-
cause unregistered users are likely to be newer and
therefore less likely to be incorporating references
to Wikipedia-specific rules and norms into their pro-
jected identities (and, therefore, their conversation),
we hypothesized that editors of different statuses
would use different kinds of authority claims.

Indeed, this is borne out. While no user group
was significantly more or less likely than any other
to include authority claims overall in their posts
(chi square test for independence, n=3164, df=2,
χ2=2.367, p=.306) users of different statuses did use
significantly different proportions of each type of
claim (chi square test for independence, n=973, df=8

external types, and percentage of total turns which con-
tained claims, across user statuses

χ2=38.301, p<.001). As illustrated in Table 5, ad-
ministrators are more likely than the other groups to
make forum claims and less likely to make exter-
nal claims, unregistered users make more external
claims and fewer forum claims, and registered users
exhibit a claim distribution that more closely reflects
the overall distribution of claim types.

4.3 Authority Claim Prevalence by V-Index

Given the few visible markers of status on Wikipedia
and the fact that editors are constantly interact-
ing with new collaborators, Wikipedians perform
authority by adopting insider language and norms
of interaction. Supporting arguments with specific
references is one such norm. Thus we hypothe-
sized that as editors become more integrated into
Wikipedia, they will make more authority claims.
In order to test this hypothesis, we developed “v-
index” as a proxy measure of degree of integration or
“veteran status” within the community. Inspired by
Ball’s (2005) “h-index” of scholarly productivity, v-
index balances frequency of interaction with length
of interaction. Specifically, an editor’s v-index at the
time of a particular revision is the greatest v such
that the editor has made at least v edits within the
past v months (28-day periods).

We measured the v-index for each revision in
our dataset, using all edits to Wikipedia in order
to calculate v (not just edits to the discussions we
have annotated). The v-index values for edits within
our dataset range from 1 to 46.4 We measured the
proportion of turns with authority claims (of any
type) for each v-index. The proportion of turns
with authority claims is in fact positively correlated

4The data becomes very sparse for v-indices above 29, with
every v-index in this range represented by < 10 turns, so the
v-indices of 30-46 were not included in this analysis.

4.4 Interaction of Social Phenomena

Thus far, we have been addressing our social acts
independently, but of course no social act occurs in
a vacuum. Alignment moves and authority claims
are only two types of social acts; many other types
of social acts are present (and could be annotated) in
this same data set. Even with only these two types
(and their subtypes), however, we find interactions.

We hypothesized that authority claims would be
likely to provoke alignment moves. That is, al-
though participants may make alignment moves
whenever someone else has expressed an opinion or
taken action (e.g. edited the article attached to the
discussion), we hypothesized that by making an au-
thority claim, a participant becomes more likely to
become a focal point in the debate. To test this,
we calculated, for every turn, the number of align-
ment moves targeted at the author of that turn within
the next 10 turns. We then divided the turns into
those that contained authority claims and those that
did not. Making an authority claim in a given turn
made the participant significantly more likely to be
the target of an alignment move within the subse-
quent 10 turns compared to turns that did not contain
any claims (t=-2.086, df=772, p=.037; Table 6))

Furthermore, we find that different types of au-
thority claims elicit different numbers of subsequent
alignment moves. Specifically, turns that contain ei-
ther external claims or forum claims (the two most
prevalent claim types in our sample) interact dif-
ferently with alignment. External claims elicited
more alignment overall (t=3.189, df=411, p=.002)
and more negative alignment moves than did forum
claims (t=3.839, df=415, p<.001). However, ex-
ternal claims did not elicit significantly more pos-
itive alignment moves than forum claims (t=0.695,
df=309, p=.488). This is illustrated in Table 7.

5 Conclusion

We have presented the Authority and Alignment
in Wikipedia Discussions (AAWD) corpus, a col-
lection of 365 discussions drawn from Wikipedia
talk pages and annotated for two broad types of so-
cial acts: authority claims and alignment moves.
These annotations make explicit important discur-
sive strategies that discussion participants use to
construct their identities in this online forum. That
“identity work” is being done with these social acts
is confirmed by the correlations we find between
proportions of turns with authority claims and ex-
ternal variables such as user status and v-index, on
the one hand, and the interaction between authority
claims and alignment moves on the other.

As an example of a social medium, Wikipedia is
characterized by its task-orientation and by the fact
that all of the interactants’ “identity work” with re-
spect to their identity in the medium is captured in
the database. This, in turn, causes the data set to be
rich in the type of social acts we are investigating.
The dataset was used for research in automatic de-
tection of forum claims, as presented in a compan-
ion paper (Marin et al., 2011). That work focused
on using lexical features, filtered through word lists
obtained from domain experts and through data-
driven methods, and extended with parse tree infor-
mation. Automatic detection of other types of au-
thority claims and of alignment moves is left for fu-
ture research.

We believe that, as social acts, authority claims
and alignment moves are broadly recognized com-
munication behaviors that play an important role in
human interaction across a variety of contexts. How-
ever, because Wikipedia discussions are shaped by
a set of well-defined, local communication norms
which are closely tied to the task of distributed,
collaborative writing, we expect authority claims
and alignment moves will manifest differently in
other genres. Future work could explore the range

of variation among the linguistic cues associated
with authority and alignment categories across gen-
res, cultures and communication media, as well
as the possible role of additional categories or so-
cial acts not discussed here. We believe that the
communicative ecology of Wikipedia discussions,
combined with the rich metadata of the Wikipedia
database, presents a highly valuable natural labora-
tory in which to explore social scientific analyses of
communication behaviors as well as a resource for
the development of NLP systems which can auto-
matically identify these social acts, in Wikipedia and
beyond.
