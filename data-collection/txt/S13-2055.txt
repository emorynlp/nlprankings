Abstract

This paper describes the systems submitted by
Avaya Labs (AVAYA) to SemEval-2013 Task
2 - Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. For the
constrained conditions of both the message
polarity classification and contextual polarity
disambiguation subtasks, our approach cen-
ters on training high-dimensional, linear clas-
sifiers with a combination of lexical and syn-
tactic features. The constrained message po-
larity model is then used to tag nearly half
a million unlabeled tweets. These automati-
cally labeled data are used for two purposes:
1) to discover prior polarities of words and
2) to provide additional training examples for
self-training. Our systems performed compet-
itively, placing in the top five for all subtasks
and data conditions. More importantly, these
results show that expanding the polarity lexi-
con and augmenting the training data with un-
labeled tweets can yield improvements in pre-
cision and recall in classifying the polarity of
non-neutral messages and contexts.

1 Introduction

The past decade has witnessed a massive expansion
in communication from long-form delivery such
as e-mail to short-form mechanisms such as mi-
croblogging and short messaging service (SMS) text
messages. Simultaneously businesses, media out-
lets, and investors are increasingly relying on these
messages as sources of real-time information and
are increasingly turning to sentiment analysis to dis-
cover product trends, identify customer preferences,
and categorize users. While a variety of corpora ex-

ist for developing and evaluating sentiment classi-
fiers for long-form texts such as product reviews,
there are few such resources for evaluating senti-
ment algorithms on microblogs and SMS texts.

The organizers of SemEval-2013 task 2, have be-
gun to address this resource deficiency by coordi-
nating a shared evaluation task for Twitter sentiment
analysis. In doing so they have assembled corpora
in support of the following two subtasks:

Task A - Contextual Polarity Disambiguation
“Given a message containing a marked in-
stance of a word or phrase, determine whether
that instance is positive, negative or neutral in
that context.”

Task B - Message Polarity Classification “Given
a message, classify whether the message is
of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
For messages conveying both a positive and
negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger
sentiment should be chosen.”

This paper describes the systems submitted by
Avaya Labs for participation in subtasks A and B.
Our goal for this evaluation was to investigate the
usefulness of dependency parses, polarity lexicons,
and unlabeled tweets for sentiment classification on
short messages. In total we built four systems for
SemEval-2013 task 2. For task B we developed a
constrained model using supervised learning, and
an unconstrained model that used semi-supervised
learning in the form of self-training and polarity lex-
icon expansion. For task A the constrained sys-
tem utilized supervised learning, while the uncon-
strained model made use of the expanded lexicon

from task B. Output from these systems were sub-
mitted to all eight evaluation conditions. For a com-
plete description of the data, tasks, and conditions,
please refer to Wilson et al. (2013). The remainder
of this paper details the approaches, experiments and
results associated with each of these models.

2 Related Work

Over the past few years sentiment analysis has
grown from a nascent topic in natural language pro-
cessing to a broad research area targeting a wide
range of text genres and applications. There is
now a significant body of work that spans topics
as diverse as document level sentiment classifica-
tion (Pang and Lee, 2008), induction of word polar-
ity lexicons (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997;
Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Moham-
mad and Turney, 2011) and even election prediction
(Tumasjan et al., 2010).

Efforts to train sentiment classifiers for Twitter
messages have largely relied on using emoticons
and hashtags as proxies of the true polarity (Bar-
bosa and Feng, 2010; Davidov et al., 2010b; Pak and
Paroubek, 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011; Kouloumpis
et al., 2011; Mohammad, 2012). Classification of
word and phrase sentiment with respect to surround-
ing context (Wilson et al., 2005) has yet to be ex-
plored for the less formal language often found in
microblog and SMS text. Semi-supervised learn-
ing has been applied to polarity lexicon induction
(Rao and Ravichandran, 2009), and sentiment clas-
sification at the sentence level (Täckström and Mc-
Donald, 2011) and document level (Sindhwani and
Melville, 2008; He and Zhou, 2011); however to
the best of our knowledge self-training and other
semi-supervised learning has seen only minimal use
in classifying Twitter texts (Davidov et al., 2010a;
Zhang et al., 2012).

3 System Overview

Given our overarching goal of combining polarity
lexicons, syntactic information and unlabeled data,
our approach centered on first building strong con-
strained models and then improving performance
by adding additional data and resources. For
both tasks, our data-constrained approach com-
bined standard features for document classification

conj → conj 〈conjunction〉
pobj → prep 〈preposition〉
pcomp→ prepc 〈preposition〉
prep|punct|cc→ ∅

with dependency parse and word polarity features
into a weighted linear classifier. For our data-
unconstrained models we used pointwise mutual in-
formation for lexicon expansion in conjunction with
self-training to increase the size of the feature space.

4 Preprocessing and Text Normalization

Our systems were built with ClearTK (Ogren et
al., 2008) a framework for developing NLP com-
ponents built on top of Apache UIMA. Our pre-
processing pipeline utilized ClearTK’s wrappers for
ClearNLP’s (Choi and McCallum, 2013) tokenizer,
lemmatizer, part-of-speech (POS) tagger, and de-
pendency parser. ClearNLP’s ability to retain emoti-
cons and emoji as individual tokens made it espe-
cially attractive for sentiment analysis. POS tags
were mapped from Penn Treebank-style tags to the
simplified, Twitter-oriented tags introduced by Gim-
pel et al. (2011). Dependency graphs output by
ClearNLP were also transformed to the Stanford
Collapsed dependencies representation (de Marneffe
and Manning, 2012) using our own transformation
rules (table 1). Input normalization consisted solely
of replacing all usernames and URLs with common
placeholders.

5 Sentiment Resources

A variety of our classifier features rely on manually
tagged sentiment lexicons and word lists. In partic-
ular we make use of the MPQA Subjectivity Lexi-
con (Wiebe et al., 2005) as well as manually-created
negation and emoticon dictionaries1. The negation
word list consisting of negation words such as no
and not. Because tokenization splits contractions,
the list includes the sub-word token n’t as well as
the apostrophe-less version of 12 contractions (e.g.
cant, wont, etc . . . ). To support emoticon-specific
features we created a dictionary, which paired 183
emoticons with either a positive or negative polarity.

6 Message Polarity Classification

6.1 Features

Polarized Bag-of-Words Features: Instead of ex-
tracting raw bag-of words (BOW), we opted to in-
tegrate negation directly into the word representa-
tions following the approaches used by Das and
Chen (2001) and Pang et al. (2002). All words
between a negation word and the first punctuation
mark after the negation word were suffixed with
a NOT tag – essentially doubling the number of
BOW features. We extended this polarized BOW
paradigm to include not only the raw word forms
but all of the following combinations: raw word, raw
word+PTB POS tag, raw word+simplified POS tag,
lemma+simplified POS tag.
Word Polarity Features: Using a subjectivity lex-
icon, we extracted features for the number of posi-
tive, negative, and neutral words as well as the net
polarity based on these counts. Individual word po-
larities were inverted if the word had a child depen-
dency relation with a negation (neg) label. Con-
strained models use the MPQA lexicon, while un-
constrained models use an expanded lexicon that is
described in section 6.2.
Emoticon Features: Similar to the word polarity
features, we computed features for the number of
positive, negative, and neutral emoticons, and the
net emoticon polarity score.
Microblogging Features: As noted by Kouloumpis
et al. (2011), the emotional intensity of words in so-
cial media messages is often emphasized by changes
to the word form such as capitalization, charac-
ter repetition, and emphasis characters (asterisks,
dashes). To capture this intuition we compute fea-
tures for the number of fully-capitalized words,
words with characters repeated more than 3 times
(e.g. booooo), and words surround by asterisks or
dashes (e.g. *yay*). We also created a binary fea-
ture to indicate the presence of a winning score or
winning record within the target span (e.g. Oh yeah
#Nuggets 15-0).
Part-of-Speech Tag Features: Counts of the Penn
Treebank POS tags provide a rough measure of the
content of the message.
Syntactic Dependency Features: We extracted
dependency pair features using both standard and
collapsed dependency parse graphs. Extracted

head/child relations include: raw word/raw word,
lemma/lemma, lemma/simplified POS tag, simpli-
fied POS tag/lemma. If the head node of the relation
has a child negation dependency, the pair’s relation
label is prefixed with a NEG tag.

6.2 Expanding the Polarity Lexicon

Unseen words pose a recurring challenge for both
machine learning and dictionary-based approaches
to sentiment analysis. This problem is even more
prevalent in social media and SMS messages where
text lengths are often limited to 140 characters or
less. To expand our word polarity lexicon we adopt
a framework similar to the one introduced by Turney
(2002). Turney’s unsupervised approach centered on
computing pointwise mutual information (PMI) be-
tween highly polar seed words and bigram phrases
extracted from a corpus of product reviews.

Instead of relying solely on seed words for po-
larity, we use the constrained version of the mes-
sage polarity classifier to tag a corpus of approxi-
mately 475,000 unlabeled, English language tweets.
These tweets were collected over the period from
November 2012 to February 2013. To reduce the
number of noisy instances and to obtain a more bal-
anced distribution of sentiment labels, we eliminated
all tweets with classifier confidence scores below
0.9, 0.7, and 0.8 for positive, negative and neutral
instances respectively. Applying the threshold, re-
duced the tweet count to 180,419 tweets (50,789
positive, 59,029 negative, 70,601 neutral). This fil-
tered set of automatically labeled tweets was used
to accumulate co-occurrence statistics between the
words in the tweets and their corresponding senti-
ment labels. These statistics are then used to com-
pute word-sentiment PMI (equation 1), which is
the joint probability of a word and sentiment co-
occurring divided by the probability of each of the
events occurring independently. A word’s net po-
larity is computed as the signum (sgn) of the differ-
ence between a its positive and negative PMI values
(equation 2). It should be noted that polarities were
deliberately limited to values of {-1, 0, +1} to ensure
consistency with the existing MPQA lexicon, and to
dampen the bias of any single word.

PMI(word, sentiment) = log2
p(word, sentiment)

p(word)p(sentiment)
(1)

polarity(word) = sgn(PMI(word, positive)−
PMI(word, negative))

(2)

Words with fewer than 10 occurrences, words
with neutral polarities, numbers, single characters,
and punctuation were then removed from this PMI-
derived polarity dictionary. Lastly, this dictionary
was merged with the dictionary created from the
MPQA lexicon yielding a final polarity dictionary
with 11,740 entries. In cases where an entry existed
in both dictionaries, the MPQA polarity value was
retained. This final polarity dictionary was used by
the unconstrained models for task A and B.

6.3 Model Parameters and Training
Constrained Model: Models were trained us-
ing the LIBLINEAR classification library (Fan et
al., 2008). L2 regularized logistic regression was
chosen over other LIBLINEAR loss functions be-
cause it not only gave improved performance on
the development set but also produced calibrated
outcomes for confidence thresholding. Training
data for the constrained model consisted of all
9829 examples from the training (8175 exam-
ples) and development (1654 examples) set re-
leased for SemEval 2013. Cost and label-specific
cost weight parameters were selected via exper-
imentation on the development set to maximize
the average positive and negative F1 values. The
c values ranged over {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 100}
and the label weights wpolarity ranged over
{0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100}. Final parameters
for the constrained model were cost c = 1 and
weights wpositive = 1, wnegative = 25, and
wneutral = 1.
Unconstrained Model: In addition to using the ex-
panded polarity dictionary described in 6.2 for fea-
ture extraction, the unconstrained model also makes
use of automatically labeled tweets for self-training
(Scudder, 1965). In contrast to preparation of the ex-
panded polarity dictionary, the self-training placed
no threshold on the examples. Combining the self-
labeled tweets, with the official training and devel-
opment set yielded a new training set consisting

of 485,112 examples. Because the self-labeled in-
stances were predominantly tagged neutral, the LI-
BLINEAR cost parameters were adjusted to heav-
ily discount neutral while emphasizing positive and
neutral instances. The size and cost of training
this model prevented extensive parameter tuning and
instead were chosen based on experience with the
constrained model and to maximize recall on pos-
itive and negative items. Final parameters for the
unconstrained model were cost c = 1 and cate-
gory weights wpositive = 2, wnegative = 5, and
wneutral = 0.1.

7 Contextual Polarity Disambiguation

7.1 Features

The same base set of features used for message po-
larity classification were used for the contextual po-
larity classification, with the exception of the syn-
tactic dependency features. To better express the in-
context and out-of-context relation these additional
feature classes were added:

Scoped Dependency Features: Because this task
focuses on a smaller context within the message,
collapsed dependencies are less useful as the com-
pression may cross over context boundaries. In-
stead the standard syntactic dependency features de-
scribed above were modified to account for their re-
lation to the context. All governing relations for the
words contained within the contact were extracted.
Relations wholly contained within the boundaries of
the context were prefixed with an IN tag, whereas
those that crossed outside of the context were pre-
fixed with an OUT tag. Additionally counts of IN
and OUT relations were included as features.

Dependency Path Features: Like the single de-
pendency arcs, a dependency path can provide addi-
tional information about the syntactic and semantic
role of the context in the sentence. Our path fea-
tures consisted of two varieties: 1) POS-path and
2) Sentiment-POS-path. The POS-path consisted of
the PTB POS tags and dependency relation labels
for all nodes between the head of the context and the
root node of the parent sentence. The Sentiment-
POS-path follows the same path but omits the de-
pendency relation labels, uses the simplified POS
tags and appends word polarities (POS/NEG/NTR)
to the POS tags along the path.

Table 3: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation (Task A) Results

For example given the bold-faced context in the
sentence:

@User Criminals killed Sadat, and in the
process they killed Egypt. . . they destroyed
the future of young & old Egyptians..

the extracted POS-path feature would be:

{NNP} dobj <{VBD} conj <{VBD}
ccomp <{VBD} root <{TOP}

while the Sentiment-POS path would be:

{ˆ/pos}{V/neg}{V/neg}{V/neg}{TOP}.

Paths with depth greater than 4 dependency rela-
tions were truncated to reduce feature sparsity. In
addition to these detailed path features, we include
two binary features to indicate if any part of the path
contains subject or object relations.

7.2 Model Parameters and Training
Like with message polarity classification, the con-
textual polarity disambiguation systems rely on LI-
BLINEAR’s L2 regularized logistic regression for
model training. Both constrained and unconstrained
models use identical parameters of cost c = 1

and weights wpositive = 1, wnegative = 2, and
wneutral = 1. They vary only in the choice of polar-
ity lexicon. The constrained model uses the MPQA
subjectivity lexicon, while the unconstrained model
uses the expanded dictionary derived via computa-
tion of PMI, which ultimately differentiates these
models through the variation in the sentiment path
and word polarity features.

8 Experiments and Results

In this section we report results for the series of Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter tasks at SemEval 2013.
Please refer to refer to Wilson et al. (2013) for the
exact details about the corpora, evaluation condi-
tions, and methodology.

We submitted polarity output for the Message Po-
larity Classification (task B) and the Contextual Po-
larity Disambiguation (task A). For each task we
submitted system output from our constrained and
unconstrained models. As stated above, the con-
strained models made use of only the training data
released for the task, whereas the unconstrained
models trained on additional tweets. Each subtask
had two test sets one comprised of tweets and the
other comprised of SMS messages. Final task 2

evaluation is based on the average positive and neg-
ative F-score. Task B results are listed in table 2,
and task A results are shown in table 3. For compar-
ison these tables also include the top-ranked system
in each category as well as the mean scores across
all submissions.

9 Error Analysis

To better understand our systems’ limitations we
manually inspected misclassified output. Table 4
lists errors representative of the common issues un-
covered in our error analysis.

Though some degree of noise is expected in senti-
ment analysis, we found several instances of annota-
tion error or ambiguity where it could be argued that
the system was actually correct. The message in #1
was annotated as neutral, whereas the presence of
the word “yay” suggests an overall positive polarity.
The text in #2 could be interpreted as positive, nega-
tive or neutral depending on the author’s disposition.

Unseen vocabulary and unexpected usages were
the largest category of error. For example in #3
“crashed” means to attend without an invitation in-
stead of the more negative meaning associated with
car accidents and airplane failures. Although POS
features can disambiguate word senses, in this case
more sophisticated features for word sense disam-
biguation could help. While the degradation in
performance between the Tweet and SMS test sets
might be explained by differences in medium, er-
rors like those found in #4 and #5 suggest that this
may have more to do with the dialectal differences
between the predominantly American and British
English found in the Tweet test set and the Collo-
quial Singaporean English (aka Singlish) found in
the SMS test set. Error #6 illustrates both how hash-
tags composed of common words can easily become

a problem when assigning a polarity to a short con-
text. Hashtag segmentation presents one possible
path to reducing this source of error.

10 Conclusions and Future Work

The results and rankings reported in section 8 sug-
gest that our systems were competitive in assign-
ing sentiment across the varied tasks and data con-
ditions. We performed particularly well in dis-
ambiguating contextual polarities finishing second
overall on the Tweet test set. We hypothesize this
performance is largely due to the expanded vocabu-
lary obtained via unlabeled data and the richer syn-
tactic context captured with dependency path repre-
sentations.

Looking forward, we expect that term recall and
unseen vocabulary will continue to be key chal-
lenges for sentiment analysis on social media. While
larger amounts of data should assist in that pursuit,
we would like to explore how a more iterative ap-
proach to self-training and lexicon expansion may
provide a less noisy path to attaining such recall.
