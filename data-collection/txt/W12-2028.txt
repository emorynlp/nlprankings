Abstract

Previous work on automated error recognition
and correction of texts written by learners of
English as a Second Language has demon-
strated experimentally that training classifiers
on error-annotated ESL text generally outper-
forms training on native text alone and that
adaptation of error correction models to the
native language (L1) of the writer improves
performance. Nevertheless, most extant mod-
els have poor precision, particularly when at-
tempting error correction, and this limits their
usefulness in practical applications requiring
feedback.

We experiment with various feature types,
varying quantities of error-corrected data, and
generic versus L1-specific adaptation to typi-
cal errors using Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) classifiers
and develop one model which maximizes pre-
cision. We report and discuss the results for
8 models, 5 trained on the HOO data and
3 (partly) on the full error-coded Cambridge
Learner Corpus, from which the HOO data is
drawn.

1 Introduction

The task of detecting and correcting writing errors
made by learners of English as a Second Language
(ESL) has recently become a focus of research.

The majority of previous papers in this area
have presented machine learning methods with mod-
els being trained on well-formed native English
text (Eeg-Olofsson and Knutsson, 2003; De Felice
and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Han et al.,
2006; Izumi et al., 2003; Tetreault and Chodorow,

2008; Tetreault et al., 2010). However, some recent
approaches have explored ways of using annotated
non-native text either by incorporating error-tagged
data into the training process (Gamon, 2010; Han
et al., 2010), or by using native language-specific
error statistics (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Ro-
zovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth,
2011). Both approaches show improvements over
the models trained solely on well-formed native text.

Training a model on error-tagged non-native
text is expensive, as it requires large amounts of
manually-annotated data, not currently publically
available. In contrast, using native language-specific
error statistics to adapt a model to a writer’s first or
native language (L1) is less restricted by the amount
of training data.

Rozovskaya and Roth (2010b; 2010c) show that
adapting error corrections to the writer’s L1 and in-
corporating artificial errors, in a way that mimics
the typical error rates and confusion patterns of non-
native text, improves both precision and recall com-
pared to classifiers trained on native data only. The
approach proposed in Rozovskaya and Roth (2011)
uses L1-specific error correction patterns as a dis-
tribution on priors over the corrections, incorporat-
ing the appropriate priors into a generic Naı̈ve Bayes
(NB) model. This approach is both cheaper to im-
plement, since it does not require a separate classi-
fier to be trained for every L1, and more effective,
since the priors condition on the writer’s L1 as well
as on the possible confusion sets.

Some extant approaches have achieved good re-
sults on error detection. However, error correction
is much harder and on this task precision remains

242



low. This is a disadvantage for applications such
as self-tutoring or writing assistance, which require
feedback to the user. A high proportion of error-
ful suggestions is likely to further confuse learners
and/or non-native writers rather than improve their
writing or assist learning. Instead a system which
maximizes precision over recall returning accurate
suggestions for a small proportion of errors is likely
to be more helpful (Nagata and Nakatani, 2010).

In section 2 we describe the data used for train-
ing and testing the systems we developed. In sec-
tion 3 we describe the preprocessing of the ESL text
undertaken to provide a source of features for the
classifiers. We also discuss the feature types that
we exploit in our classifiers. In section 4 we de-
scribe and report results for a high precision system
which makes no attempt to generalize from train-
ing data. In section 5 we describe our approach to
adapting multiclass NB classifiers to characteristic
errors and L1s. We also report the performance of
some of these NB classifiers on the training and test
data. In section 6 we report the official results of
all our submitted runs on the test data and also on
the HOO training data, cross-validated where appro-
priate. Finally, we briefly discuss our main results,
further work, and lessons learnt.

2 Cambridge Learner Corpus

The Cambridge Learner Corpus1 (CLC) is a large
corpus of learner English. It has been developed
by Cambridge University Press in collaboration with
Cambridge Assessment, and contains examination
scripts written by learners of English from 86 L1
backgrounds. The scripts have been produced by
language learners taking Cambridge Assessment’s
ESL examinations.2

The linguistic errors committed by the learners
have been manually annotated using a taxonomy of
86 error types (Nicholls, 2003). Each error has been
manually identified and tagged with an appropriate
code, specifying the error type, and a suggested cor-
rection. Additionally, the scripts are linked to meta-
data about examination and learner. This includes
the year of examination, the question prompts, the

custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-
Cambridge-Learner-Corpus

2http://www.cambridgeesol.org/

learner’s L1, as well as the grades obtained. The cur-
rent version of the CLC contains about 20M words
of error-annotated scripts from a wide variety of ex-
aminations.

The HOO training and test datasets are drawn
from the CLC. The training dataset is a reformatted
1000-script subset of a publically-available subset of
CLC scripts produced by learners sitting the First
Certficate in English (FCE) examination.3 This ex-
amination assesses English at an upper-intermediate
level, so many learners sitting this exam still man-
ifest a number of errors motivated by the conven-
tions of their L1s. The CLC-FCE subcorpus was ex-
tracted, anonymized, and made available as a set of
XML files by Yannakoudakis et al. (2011).4

The HOO training dataset contains scripts from
FCE examinations undertaken in the years 2000 and
2001 written by speakers of 16 L1s. These scripts
can be divided into two broad L1 typological groups,
Asian (Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese) and Euro-
pean (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Catalan,
Greek, Russian, Polish). The latter can be further
subdivided into Slavic (Russian, Polish) and Ro-
mance. In turn, the Romance languages differ in ty-
pological relatedness with, for example, Portuguese
and Spanish being closer than Spanish and French.
Error coding which is not relevant to preposition or
determiner errors has been removed from the train-
ing data so that only six error type annotations are
retained for training: incorrect, missing or unnec-
essary determiners (RD, MD, UD) and prepositions
(RT, MT, UT).

One consequence of this reformatting is that the
contexts of these errors often contain further errors
of different types that are no longer coded. The idea
is that errors should be considered in their natural
habitat, and that correcting and copy-editing the sur-
rounding text would create an artificial task. On the
other hand, not correcting anything makes it difficult
in some cases and nigh impossible in others to de-
termine whether a given determiner or preposition is
correct or not. The error-coding in the CLC in such
cases (provided the writer’s intent is deemed recov-
erable) depends not only on the original text, but also
on the correction of nearby errors.

Certain errors even appear as a direct result of
correcting others: for instance, the phrase to sleep
in tents has been corrected to to sleep in a tent in
the CLC; this ends up as a ‘correction’ to to sleep
in a tents in the HOO dataset. This issue is diffi-
cult to avoid given that the potential solutions are all
labour-intensive (explicit indication of dependencies
between error annotations, completely separate error
annotation for different types of errors, or manual re-
moval of spurious errors after extraction of the types
of error under consideration), and we mention it here
mainly to explain the origin of some surprising an-
notations in the dataset.

A more HOO-specific problem is the ‘[removal
of] elements [from] some of [the] files [...] to
dispose of nested edits and other phenomena that
caused difficulties in the preprocessing of the data’
(Dale et al., 2012). This approach unfortunately
leads to mutilated sentences such as I think if we
wear thistoevery wherespace ships. This mean. re-
placing the original I think if we wear this clothes we
will travel to every where easier than we use cars,
ships, planes and space ships. This mean the engi-
neering will find the way to useless petrol for it, so it
must useful in the future.

The HOO test set consists of 100 responses to
individual prompts from FCE examinations set be-
tween 1993 and 2009, also drawn from the CLC.
As a side effect of removing the test data from the
full CLC, we have discovered that the distribution of
L1s, examination years and exam prompts is differ-
ent from the training data. There are 27 L1s exem-
plified, a superset of the 16 seen in the HOO train-
ing data; about half are Romance, and the rest are
widely distributed with Asian and Slavic languages
less well represented than in the training data.

In the experiments reported below, we make use
of both the HOO training data and the full 20M
words of error-annotated CLC, but with the HOO
test data removed, to train our systems. Whenever
we use the larger training set we refer to this as the
full CLC below.

3 Data Preprocessing

We parsed the training and test data (see Section
2) using the Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing
(RASP) system with the standard tokenization and

My friend was (MD: a) good student

Grammatical Relations (GRs):
(ncsubj be+ed:3 VBDZ friend:2 NN1 )
(xcomp be+ed:3 VBDZ student:6 NN1)
(ncmod student:6 NN1 good:5 JJ)
(det friend:2 NN1 My:1 APP$)

*(det student:6 NN1 a:4 AT1)

Figure 1: RASP GR output

sentence boundary detection modules and the unlex-
icalized version of the parser (Briscoe et al., 2006)
in order to broaden the space of candidate fea-
tures types. The features used in our experiments
are mainly motivated by the fact that lexical and
grammatical features have been shown in previous
work to be effective for error detection and correc-
tion. We believe RASP is an appropriate tool to
use with ESL text because the PoS tagger deploys
a well-developed unknown word handling mecha-
nism, which makes it relatively robust to noisy in-
put such as misspellings, and because the parser de-
ploys a hand-coded grammar which indicates un-
grammaticality of sentences and markedness of con-
structions and is encoded entirely in terms of PoS
tag sequences. We utilize the open-source version
of RASP embedded in an XML-handling pipeline
that allows XML-encoded metadata in the CLC and
HOO training data to be preserved in the output,
but ensures that unannotated text is passed to RASP
(Andersen et al., 2008).

Relevant output of the system is shown in Fig-
ure 1 for a typical errorful example. The grammati-
cal relations (GRs) form a connected, directed graph
of typed bilexical head-dependent relations (where a
non-fragmentary analysis is found). Nodes are lem-
matized word tokens with associated PoS tag and
sentence position number. Directed arcs are labelled
with GR types. In the factored representation shown
here, each line represents a GR type, the head node,
the dependent node, and optional subtype informa-
tion either after the GR type or after the dependent.
In this example, the asterisked GR would be missing
in the errorful version of the sentence. We extract the
most likely analysis for each sentence based on the
most probable tag sequence found by the tagger.

Extraction of the lexical and grammatical infor-

244



mation from the parser output is easier when a deter-
miner or preposition is present than when it is miss-
ing. During training, for all nouns, we checked for a
det relation to a determiner, and whenever no det
GR is present, we checked whether the noun is pre-
ceded by an MD annotation in the XML file. For
missing prepositions, we have only extracted cases
where a noun is governed by a verb with a dobj
relation, and cases where a noun is governed by an-
other noun with an ncmod (non-clausal modifier)
relation. For example, in It’s been a long time since
I last wrote you, in absence of the preposition to the
parser would ‘recognize’ a dobj relation between
you and wrote, and this case would be used as a
training example for a missing preposition, while I
trusted him with the same dobj relation between
trusted and him would be used as a training exam-
ple to correct unwanted use of a preposition as in I
trusted *to him.

3.1 Feature Types
In all the experiments and system configurations
described below, we used a similar set of features
based on the following feature templates.

For determiner errors:

• Noun lemma: lemma of the noun that gov-
erns the determiner

• Noun PoS: PoS tag of the noun

• Distance from Noun: distance in num-
ber of words to the governed determiner

• Head lemma: head lemma in the shortest
grammatical relation in which the noun is de-
pendent

• Head PoS: as defined above, but with PoS tag
rather than lemma

• Distance from Head: distance in num-
ber of words to the determiner from head, as
defined above (for Head lemma)

• GR type to Noun: a GR between Head
and Noun.

For instance for the example shown in Figure 1, the
noun lemma is student, the noun PoS is NN1, the

distance from the noun is 2, the head lemma is be,
the head PoS is VBDZ, and the distance from the
head is 1, while the GR type to the noun is xcomp.

For preposition errors:

• Preposition (P): target preposition

• Head lemma (H): head lemma of the GR in
which the preposition is dependent

• Dependent lemma (D): dependent
lemma of the GR in which the preposition is
head.

For instance, in I am looking forward to your reply,
P is to, H is look and D is reply.

In contrast to work by Rozovskaya and Roth,
amongst others, we have not used word context fea-
tures, but instead focused on grammatical context in-
formation for detecting and correcting errors. We
also experimented with some other feature types,
such as n-grams consisting of the head, preposition
and dependent lemmas, but these did not improve
performance on the cross-validated HOO training
data, perhaps because they are sparser and the train-
ing set is small. However, there are many other po-
tential feature types, such as PoS n-grams or syn-
tactic rule types, and so forth that we don’t explore
here, despite their probable utility. Our main focus
in these experiments is not on optimal feature engi-
neering but rather on the issues of classifier adaption
to errors and high precision error correction.

4 A Simple High Precision Correction
System

We have experimented with a number of approaches
to maximizing precision and have not outperformed
a simple model that doesn’t generalize from the
training data using machine learning techniques. We
leverage the large amount of error-corrected text in
the full CLC to learn reliable contexts in which er-
rors occur and their associated corrections. For the
HOO shared task, we tested variants of this approach
for missing determiner (MD) and incorrect prepo-
sition (RT) errors. Better performing features and
thresholds used to define contexts were found by
testing variants on the HOO training data. The fea-
ture types from section 3.1 deployed for the MD
system submitted for the official run were Noun

245



lemma, Noun PoS, GR types to Noun and
GR types from Noun (set of GRs which has
the noun as head). For the RT system, all three P, H,
and D features were used to define contexts. A con-
text is considered reliable if it occurs at least twice
in the full CLC and more than 75% of the time it
occurs with an error.

The performance of this system on the training
data was very similar to performance on the test data
(in contrast to our other runs). We also explored L1-
specific and L1-group variants of these systems; for
instance, we split the CLC data into Asian and Eu-
ropean languages, trained separate systems on each,
and then applied them according to the L1 meta-
data supplied with the HOO training data. However,
all these systems performed worse than the best un-
adapted system.

The results for the generic, unadapted MD and RT
systems appear as run 0 in Tables 4–9 below. These
figures are artefactually low as we don’t attempt to
detect or correct UD, UT, RD or MT errors. The
actual results computed from the official runs solely
for MD errors are for detection, recognition and cor-
rection: 83.33 precision and 7.63 recall, which gives
an F-measure of 13.99; the RT system performed at
66.67 precision, 8.05 recall and 14.37 F-measure on
the detection, recognition and correction tasks. De-
spite the low recall, this was our best submitted sys-
tem in terms of official correction F-score.

5 Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) (Un)Adapted
Multiclass Classifiers

Rozovskaya and Roth (2011) demonstrate on a
different dataset that Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) can out-
perform discriminative classifiers on preposition
error detection and correction if the prior is adapted
to L1-specific estimates of error-correction pairs.
They compare the performance of an unadapted
NB multiclass classifier, in which the prior for a
preposition is defined as the relative probability
of seeing a specific preposition compared to a
predefined subset of the overall PoS class (which
they call the Conf(usion) Set):

prior(p) =
C(p)∑

q∈ConfSet C(q)
,

to the performance of the same NB classfier with
an adapted prior which calculates the probability of
a correct preposition as:

prior(c, p, L1) =
CL1(p, c)

CL1(p)
,

where CL1(p) is the number of times preposition
p is seen in texts written by learners with L1 as
their native language, and CL1(p, c) is the number
of times c is the correct preposition when p is used.

We applied Rozovskaya and Roth’s approach to
determiners as well as prepositions, and experi-
mented with priors calculated in the same way for
L1 groups as well as specific L1s. We also com-
pared L1-adaptation to generic adaption to correc-
tions, calculated as:

prior(c, p) =
C(p, c)

C(p)
,

We have limited the set of determiners and prepo-
sitions that our classifiers aim to detect and correct,
if necessary. Our confusions sets contain:

• Determiners: no determiner, the, a, an;

• Prepositions: no preposition, in, of, for,
to, at, with, on, about, from, by, after.

Therefore, for determiners, our systems were only
aimed at detecting and correcting errors in the use of
articles, and we have not taken into account any er-
rors in the use of possessive pronouns (my, our, etc.),
demonstratives (this, those, etc.), and other types of
determiners (any, some, etc.). For prepositions, it is
well known that a set of about 10 of the most fre-
quent prepositions account for more than 80% of all
prepositional usage (Gamon, 2010).

We have calculated the upper bounds for the train-
ing and test sets when the determiner and preposi-
tion confusion sets are limited this way. The upper
bound recall for recognition (i.e., ability of the clas-
sifier to recognize that there is an error, dependent on
the fact that only the chosen determiners and prepo-
sitions are considered) is calculated as the propor-
tion of cases where the incorrect, missing or unnec-
essary determiner or preposition is contained in our
confusion set. For the training set, it is estimated at
91.95, and for the test at 93.20. Since for correction,

246



the determiner or preposition suggested by the sys-
tem should also be contained in our confusion set,
upper bound recall for correction is slightly lower
than that for recognition, and is estimated at 86.24
for the training set, and at 86.39 for the test set.
These figures show that the chosen candidates dis-
tribute similarly in both datasets, and that a system
aimed at recognition and correction of only these
function words can obtain good performance on the
full task.

The 1000 training scripts were divided into 5 por-
tions pseudo-randomly to ensure that each portion
contained approximately the same number of L1-
specific scripts in order not to introduce any L1-
related bias. The results on the training set pre-
sented below were averaged across 5 runs, where in
each run 4 portions (about 800 scripts) were used
for training, and one portion (about 200 scripts) was
used for testing.

We treated the task as multi-class classification,
where the number of classes equates to the size of
our confusion set, and when the classifier’s decision
is different from the input, it is considered to be er-
rorful. For determiners, we used the full set of fea-
tures described in section 3.1, whereas for preposi-
tions, we have tried two different feature sets: only
head lemma (H), or Hwith the dependent lemma (D).

We ran the unadapted and L1-adapted NB classi-
fiers on determiners and prepositions using the fea-
tures defined above. The results of these preliminary
experiments are presented below.

5.1 Unadapted and L1-adapted NB classifiers

Tables 1 to 3 below present results averaged over
the 5 runs for the unadapted classifiers. We report
the results in terms of recall, precision and F-score
for detection, recognition and correction of errors as
defined for the HOO shared task.5

We have experimented with two types of L1-
specific classification: classifier1 below is a
combination of 16 separate multiclass NB classi-
fiers, each trained on a specific L1 and applied to
the corresponding parts of the data. Classifier2
is a replication of the classifier presented in Ro-
zovskaya and Roth (2011), which uses the priors

5For precise definitions of these measures see

adapted to the writer’s L1 and to the chosen deter-
miner or preposition at decision time. The priors
used for these runs were estimated from the HOO
training data.

We present only the results of the systems that use
H+D features for prepositions, since these systems
outperform systems using H only. Tables 1, 2 and
3 below show the comparative results of the three
classifiers averaged over 5 runs, with all errors, de-
terminer errors only, and preposition errors only, re-
spectively.

The results show some improvement with a com-
bination of classifiers trained on L1-subsets in terms
of recall for detection and recognition of errors, and
a slight improvement in precision using L1-specific
priors for preposition errors. However, in general,
unadapted classifiers outperform L1-adapted classi-
fiers with identical feature types. Therefore, we have
not included L1-specific classifiers in the submitted
set of runs.

5.2 Submitted systems
For the official runs, we trained various versions of
the unadapted and generic adapted NB classifiers.

247



We trained all the adapted priors on the full CLC
dataset in the expectation that this would yield more
accurate estimates. We trained the unadapted priors
and the NB features as before on the HOO training
dataset. We also trained the NB features on the full
CLC dataset and tested the impact of the preposi-
tion feature D (dependent lemma of the GR from the
preposition, i.e., the head of the preposition comple-
ment) with the different training set sizes. For all
runs we used the full set of determiner features de-
scribed in section 3.1.

The full set of multiclass NB classifiers submitted
is described below:

• Run1: unadapted, trained on the HOO data. H
feature for prepositions;

• Run2: unadapted, trained on the HOO data. H
and D features for prepositions;

• Run3: a combination of the NB classifiers
trained for each of the used candidate words
separately. H and D features are used for prepo-
sitions;

• Run4: generic adapted, trained on HOO data.
H feature for prepositions;

• Run5: generic adapted, trained on HOO data.
H and D features for prepositions;

• Run6: unadapted, trained on the full CLC. H
feature for prepositions;

• Run7: unadapted, trained on the full CLC. H
and D features for prepositions.

The classifiers used for runs 1 and 2 differ from
the ones used for runs 6 and 7 only in the amount
of training data. None of these classifiers involve
any adaptation. The classifiers used for runs 4 and
5 involve prior adaptation to the input determiner
or preposition, adjusted at decision time. In run
3, a combination of classifiers trained on the input
determiner- or preposition-specific partitions of the
HOO training data are used. At test time, the appro-
priate classifier from this set is applied depending on
the preposition or determiner chosen by the learner.

To limit the number of classes for the classifiers
used in runs 1–3 and 6–7, we have combined the
training cases for determiners a and an in one class

a/an; after classification one of the variants is chosen
depending on the first letter of the next word. How-
ever, for the classifiers used in runs 4–5, we used
priors including confusions between a and an.

The results for these runs on the training data are
shown in Tables 4 to 6 below.

Table 6: Training set results, preposition errors

The results on the training data show that use
of the D feature improves the performance of all
the preposition classifiers. Use of the full CLC for
training improves recall, but does not improve pre-
cision for prepositions, while for determiners pre-
cision of the classifiers trained on the full CLC
is much worse. Adaptation of the classifiers with
determiner/preposition-specific priors slightly im-
proves precision on prepositions, but is damaging
for recall. Therefore, in terms of F-score, unadapted
classifiers outperform adapted ones. The over-
all best-performing system on the cross-validated
training data is Run3, which is trained on the
determiner/preposition-specific data subsets and ap-

248



plies an input-specific classifier to test data. How-
ever, the result is due to improved performance on
determiners, not prepositions.

Table 9: Test set results, preposition errors

The test set results for NB classifiers (Runs 1–
7) are significantly worse than our preliminary re-
sults obtained on the training data partitions, espe-
cially for determiners. Use of additional training
data (Runs 6 and 7) improves recall, but does not im-
prove precision. Adaptation to the input preposition
improves precision as compared to the unadapted
classifier for prepositions (Run 4), whereas training

on the determiner-specific subsets improves preci-
sion for determiners (Run 3). However, generally
these results are worse than the results of the similar
classifiers on the training data subsets.

We calculated the upper bound recall for our clas-
sifiers on the test data. The upper bound recall on
the test data is 93.20 for recognition, and 86.39 for
correction, given our confusion sets for both deter-
miners and prepositions. However, the actual upper
bound recall is 71.82, with upper bound recall on
determiners at 71.74 and on prepositions at 71.90,
because 65 out of 230 determiner errors, and 68 out
of 243 preposition errors are not considered by our
classifiers, primarily because when the parser fails to
find a full analysis, the grammatical context is often
not recovered accurately enough to identify missing
input positions or relevant GRs. This is an inher-
ent weakness of using only parser-extracted features
from noisy and often ungrammatical input. Taking
this into account, some models (Runs 1, 2, 6 and 7)
achieved quite high recall.

We suspect the considerable drop in precision is
explained by the differences in the training and test
data. The training set contains answers from learners
of a smaller group of L1s from one examination year
to a much more restricted set of prompts. The well-
known weaknesses of generative NB classifiers may
prevent effective exploitation of the additional infor-
mation in the full CLC over the HOO training data.
Experimentation with count weighting schemes and
optimized interpolation of adapted priors may well
be beneficial (Rennie et al., 2003).
