Abstract

We present a novel model for the task
of joint mention extraction and classifi-
cation. Unlike existing approaches, our
model is able to effectively capture over-
lapping mentions with unbounded lengths.
The model is highly scalable, with a time
complexity that is linear in the number of
words in the input sentence and linear in
the number of possible mention classes.
Our model can be extended to additionally
capture mention heads explicitly in a joint
manner under the same time complexity.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model through extensive experiments on
standard datasets.

1 Introduction

One of the essential goals in natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) is the development of effective sys-
tems that can capture the underlying semantics
conveyed by human languages. An important step
towards such a goal is the development of practi-
cal systems that can efficiently extract useful shal-
low semantic information such as entities and at
the same time identify their semantic classes (e.g.,
person, organization, etc).

Such a task is often known as named entity
recognition and classification (NERC), one of
the standard tasks in information extraction (IE).
While such a task focuses on the extraction and
classification of entities in the texts which are
named, recently researchers also showed inter-
est in a closely related task – mention extraction
and classification/typing. Unlike a named entity,
a mention is typically defined as a reference to
an entity in natural language text that can be ei-
ther named, nominal or pronominal (Florian et al.,
2004). The task of mention detection and track-
ing has received substantial attention, largely due

to its important role in conducting several down-
stream tasks, such as relation extraction (Mintz et
al., 2009), entity linking (Guo et al., 2013), and
coreference resolution (Chang et al., 2013).

While most existing work on named entity
recognition and mention extraction and classifi-
cation have been effective, there remain several
key limitations associated with existing models. In
fact, one can view these problems as instances of
the more general problem of semantic tagging –
the task of assigning appropriate semantic tags to
certain text spans for a given input sentence. Un-
like part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which has been
extensively studied in the past few decades by the
community, such a semantic tagging task presents
several additional new challenges. First, a men-
tion can consist of multiple words, so its length
can be arbitrarily long. Second, the mentions can
overlap with one another. Popular models used for
POS tagging, such as linear-chain conditional ran-
dom fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) or semi-Markov
conditional random fields (Sarawagi and Cohen,
2004) have difficulties coping with these issues.
While approaches on addressing these issues ex-
ist, current algorithms typically suffer from high
time complexity (Finkel and Manning, 2009) and
are therefore difficult to scale to large datasets.
On the other hand, the problem of designing ef-
ficient and scalable models for mention extraction
and classification from natural language texts be-
comes increasingly important in this era where a
large volume of textual data is becoming available
on the Web every day – users need systems which
are able to scale to extremely large datasets to sup-
port efficient semantic analysis for timely decison-
making.

In this paper, we tackle the above-mentioned is-
sue by introducing a novel model for joint mention
extraction and classification. We make the follow-
ing major contributions in this work:

• We propose a model that is able to effectively

857



handle overlapping mentions with unbounded
lengths.
• The learning and inference algorithms of our

proposed model have a time complexity that is
linear in the number of words in the input sen-
tence and also linear in the number of possi-
ble semantic classes/types, making our model
scalable to extremely large datasets.
• Our model can additionally capture mentions’

head information in a joint manner under the
same time complexity.

2 Related Work

Existing work has been largely focused on the
task of named entity recognition and classifica-
tion (NERC). The survey of (Nadeau and Sekine,
2007) is a comprehensive study of this topic.

Most prior work took a supervised learning ap-
proach. Zhou and Su (2002) presented a system
for recognizing named entities using an HMM-
based approach. Florian et al. (2003) presented a
system for named entity recognition by combining
different classifiers. McDonald and Pereira (2005)
used conditional random fields for extracting gene
and protein mentions from biomedical texts. Rati-
nov and Roth (2009) presented a systematic anal-
ysis over several issues related to the design of a
named entity recognition and classification system
where issues such as chunk representations and
the choice of inference algorithms were discussed.
Researchers also looked into semi-supervised and
unsupervised approaches for such a task (Cuc-
chiarelli and Velardi, 2001; Etzioni et al., 2005).
Additional efforts on addressing the NERC prob-
lem under a multilingual or cross lingual setting
also exist (Florian et al., 2004; Che et al., 2013;
Wang et al., 2013).

As pointed out by Finkel and Manning (2009),
named entities are often nested. This fact was of-
ten ignored by the community largely due to tech-
nical reasons. They therefore proposed to use a
constituency parser with a O(n3) time complexity
(n is the number of words in the input sentence)
to handle nested entities, and showed its effective-
ness across several datasets. Alex et al. (2007) also
presented several approaches by building models
on top of linear-chain conditional random fields
for recognizing nested entities in biomedical texts.
Hoffmann et al. (2011) looked into a separate

issue, which is to identify overlapping relations
amongst entities.

Named entity recognition and classification still
remains a popular topic in the field of statistical
natural language processing. Ritter et al. (2011)
looked into recognizing entities from social me-
dia data that involves informal and potentially
noisy texts. Pasupat and Liang (2014) looked
into the issue of zero-shot entity extraction from
Web pages with natural language queries where
minimal supervision was used. Neelakantan and
Collins (2014) looked into the problem of auto-
matically constructing dictionaries with minimal
supervision for improved named entity extraction.
Li and Ji (2014) presented an approach to perform
the task of extraction of mentions and their rela-
tions in a joint and incremental manner.

3 Approach

3.1 Mentions and Their Combinations

Typically, a mention that appears in a natural lan-
guage sentence consists of a contiguous sequence
of natural language words. Consider a sentence
that consists of n words where each word is in-
dexed with its position in the sentence. A men-
tion m can be uniquely represented with a tuple
〈bm, em, τ〉, where bm and em are the indices of
the first and last word of the mention, respectively,
and τ is its semantic class (type).

We can see that for a given sentence consisting
of n words, there are altogether tn(n + 1)/2 pos-
sible different mention candidates, where t is the
total number of possible mention types. Now, for
each such candidate in the given sentence, it can
be either a mention, or not a mention. This leads
to a total number of 2tn(n+1)/2 possible mention
combinations. This number is prohibitively large
even for small values of n and t, which prevents us
from exhaustively enumerating all of them during
learning and inference.

One approach to performing inference over
such a large space is to introduce compact rep-
resentations that are able to encode exponentially
many mentions that would enable tractable infer-
ence algorithms to be employed. We discuss in the
next section our novel mention hypergraph repre-
sentation proposed for such a purpose.

3.2 Mention Hypergraphs

the novel mention hypergraphs that allow us to

ble combinations of mention occurrences. Links that belong
to the same hyperedge are highlighted with the same color,
and different hyperedges are highlighted with different col-
ors, e.g., the green link that connects two I nodes forms a
single hyperedge, while the two brown links that connect two
I nodes and one X node form a separate single hyperedge.

compactly represent exponentially many possible
combinations of potentially overlapping, length-
unbounded mentions of different types.

A hypergraph is a generalization of a conven-
tional graph, whose edges (a.k.a. hyperedges) can
connect two or more nodes. In this work, we con-
sider a special class of hypergraphs, where each
hyperedge consists of a designated parent node
and an ordered list of child nodes. Hypergraphs
have also been used in other fields, such as syntac-
tic parsing (Klein and Manning, 2001), semantic
parsing (Lu, 2015) and machine translation (Cme-
jrek et al., 2013).

Our mention hypergraphs consist of five types
of nodes which are used to compactly represent
many mentions of different semantic types and
boundaries, namely, A nodes, E nodes, T nodes, I
nodes, and X nodes. A partial mention hypergraph
is depicted in Figure 1. We describe the definition
of each type of nodes next.

• A nodes. These nodes are used to sequentially
arrange mentions with different left bound-
aries. Specifically, each A node at position
k (the k-th word), or Ak, is used to com-
pactly represent all such mentions in the sen-
tence whose left boundaries are exactly at or
strictly after k.

• E nodes. The node Ek is used to compactly
represent all possible mentions (possibly of
length zero) whose left boundaries are exactly
at the current position k.

• T nodes. The node Tkj is used to compactly
represent all mentions (possibly of length
zero) whose left boundaries are exactly at po-
sition k, and have the mention type j.
• I nodes. The node Ikj is used to compactly

represent all incomplete mentions which con-
tain the current word at position k as part of
the mention, and have the mention type j.
• X nodes. These are the “terminal” nodes indi-

cating the completion of a path. No additional
node will be attached to such nodes as a child.

There are also various hyperedges that con-
nect different nodes in the mention hypergraph.
We use 〈α← β1, . . . , βn〉 to denote a hyperedge
which connects a parent node α and child nodes
β1, . . . , βn. Each hyperedge essentially provides
one possible way of re-expressing the semantics
conveyed by the parent node using the child nodes.
For example, as shown in Figure 1, the hyperedge
connecting the parent node Ak and the child nodes
Ek,Ak+1 explains the fact that any mention cov-
ered by Ak either has a left boundary that is “ex-
actly at k” (Ek), or “exactly at or strictly after
k + 1” (Ak+1).

Similarly, for each I node, there exist 3 hyper-
edges that connect it to other child nodes. The top
hyperedge (in green) encodes the fact that the cur-
rent word appears in the middle of a mention; the
bottom hyperedge (in yellow) encodes the fact that
the current word appears in a mention as the last
word; the middle hyperedge (in brown) encodes
the fact that both cases can occur at the same time
(i.e., the current word belongs to multiple over-
lapping mentions of the same type). We have the
following theorem:
Theorem 3.1 Any combination of mentions in a
sentence can be represented with exactly one sub-
hypergraph of the complete mention hypergraph.

Proof For each mention, there exists a unique
path in the mention hypergraph to represent it. For
any combination of mentions, there exist unique
paths in the mention hypergraph to represent such
a combination. These paths altogether form a
unique sub-hypergraph of the original hypergraph.

For example, consider the following sentence:
“he also talked with the egyptian president .” This
sentence contains three mentions. The first is “he”
with type PER, the second is “the egyptian pres-
ident’’ with type PER, and the third mention is
“egyptian” with type GPE. Figure 2 gives the sub-
hypergraph structure showing how these mentions

are jointly represented. The mention hypergraph
defined over the input sentence contains exponen-
tially many such sub-hypergraph structures.

We note that the converse of Theorem 3.1 is not
true. In certain cases, it is possible for two differ-
ent overlapping mention combinations to share the
same mention hypergraph.

Figure 3: An example illustrating the converse of Theorem
3.1 is not true.

For example, consider a toy example sentence A
B C D shown in Figure 3, both B C and A B C D are
mentions of the same type PER (i.e. one is strictly
contained by the other. We call such combinations
type-I combinations). The above sub-hypergraph
shows how to encode such a combination. How-
ever, if both A B C and B C D are mentions of the
same type PER (i.e., two mentions overlap but no
one is contained by the other. We call such com-

binations type-II combinations), such a combina-
tion shares the same representation as the above
sub-hypergraph. Note that such an ambiguity hap-
pens only when two overlapping mentions have
the same type, and one mention is strictly con-
tained by the other and their boundaries are all dif-
ferent. In practice, however, we found that in the
two datasets that we used for evaluations, if two
mentions overlap with one another, they almost al-
ways form a type-I combination, and type-II com-
binations are very rare. Empirically, as we will see
later in our experiments, our model is effective in
handling overlapping mentions.

3.3 Log-Linear Modeling
Following the conditional random fields (Lafferty
et al., 2001), we adopted a log-linear approach for
such a joint mention extraction and typing task.
Specifically, for a given input sentence x, the prob-
ability of predicting a possible output y (a mention
sub-hypergraph that represents a particular combi-
nation of mentions) is given as follows:

p(y|x) = exp(w
T f(x,y))∑

y′ exp(wT f(x,y′))
(1)

where f(x,y) is the feature vector defined over the
input-output pair (x,y), and the weight vector w
gives the parameters of the model.

Our objective is to minimize the regularized
negative joint log-likelihood of the dataset:

L(w) =
∑

i

log
∑
y′

exp(wT f(xi,y′))

−
∑

i

wT f(xi,yi) + λwTw (2)

860



where (xi,yi) refers to the i-th training instance,
and the last term is a L2 regularization term with λ
being a positive scalar (fixed to 0.01 in this work).

The gradient of the above objective function is:

∂L(w)
∂wk

=
∑

i

Ep(y′|xi)[fk(xi,y
′)]

−
∑

i

fk(xi,yi) + 2λwk (3)

where wk is the weight of the k-th feature fk.
We note that unlike many recent latent-variable

approaches to structured prediction (Petrov and
Klein, 2007; Blunsom et al., 2008), we are able to
represent each of our outputs y with a single fully-
observed structure. Thus, our objective function
essentially defines a standard regularized softmax
regression model, and is therefore convex (Boyd
and Vandenberghe, 2004), where a global opti-
mum can be found.

The objective function defined in Equation 2
can be optimized with standard gradient-based
methods. We used L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal,
1989) as our optimization method.

3.4 Algorithms

In order to solve the optimization problem de-
scribed above, one needs to compute the values
of the gradient scores in Equation 3. Computa-
tion of the second and third terms in this equa-
tion is straightforward. The first term in Equa-
tion 3 involves the computation of an expecta-
tion of feature values over all possible mention
combinations for a given input sentence. Follow-
ing classic dynamic programming algorithms used
in graphical models, we develop analogous effi-
cient dynamic programming algorithms that work
on hypergraphs and generalize the conventional
forward-backward/inside-outside algorithm to ef-
ficiently compute such values.

Time Complexity At each time step k, we need
to compute scores for m I nodes, m T nodes, 1 E
node, and 1 A node. Hence, the overall time com-
plexity for our algorithm is in O(mn) (assuming
computation of the feature scores at each node in-
volves a constant time), where m is the total num-
ber of possible mention types, and n is the total
number of words in the given sentence. 1

1Note that the time complexity for the linear chain CRF is
in O(m2n) due to their first-order assumption.

3.5 Features
The features that we use are inspired by the work
of (Carreras et al., 2002). Specifically, we consider
the following features defined over the inputs:

• Words (and POS tags, if available) that appear
around the current word (with position infor-
mation), with a window of size 3.
• Word n-grams (and POS n-grams, if available)

that contain the current word (with position in-
formation), for n = 2, 3, 4.
• Bag of words around the current word, with a

window of size 5.
• Word pattern features 2.

Note that these are the indicator functions de-
fined over the inputs. The final set of features are
defined over (x,y) tuples, which is obtained as a
cross-product between the above indicator func-
tions and the following indicator function:

• The type of the node (such as T or I).
In addition, we also introduce the following fea-

ture defined over the output structure only:

• The number of such hyperedges that exactly
connect one T node and one I node.

We call this feature mention penalty. This fea-
ture learns a global preference of the number of
mentions that should appear in any input sentence.

3.6 Joint Modeling of Mention Heads
One additional assumption for the mention extrac-
tion and typing task is that each mention comes
with a head. A head is strictly a substring of the
mention and provides important information about
the mention. It is possible to extend our model
to support joint modeling of mention heads, while
still maintaining the same time complexity.

Due to space limitations, we could only give
a relatively brief description of this extension in
this section. The idea is to replace the I nodes
with three different types of nodes, namely Ij–B
nodes (used to represent words that appear within
a mention of type j and before its head), Ij–W
nodes (used to represent words that appear within
the head of a mention of type j), and Ij–A nodes
(used to represent words that appear within a men-
tion of type j and after its head). The hyperedges
also need to be established accordingly in order
to properly model all possible mention and head

combinations. Since in such a new hypergraph, at
each time step, only a constant number (2) of addi-
tional nodes are involved, the time complexity for
learning and inference with such a model remains
the same, which is in O(mn).

3.7 Optimization of F measure

One standard evaluation metric for named entity
recognition is the F (F1) measure. In our task,
the F measure is defined as the harmonic mean
of the precision (P ) and recall (R) scores, where
precision is the ratio between the number of cor-
rectly predicted mentions and the total number of
predicted mentions, and recall is the ratio between
the number of correctly predicted mentions and
the total number of gold mentions. We will also
adopt these metrics in our evaluations later. Un-
fortunately, the model only optimizes its objec-
tive function defined in Equation 2, which is the
negative (regularized) joint log-likelihood. Previ-
ous work showed it was possible to optimize the
F measure in a log-linear model (Suzuki et al.,
2006). Culotta and McCallum (2004) also pro-
posed a method for optimizing information extrac-
tion performance based on confidence estimation.
Their work is based on linear-chain CRF and es-
timate the confidence of extracted fields based on
marginal probabilities. The technique is not di-
rectly applicable to our task where a hypergraph
representation is used to encode overlapping men-
tions. In this work, we used a very simple and
intuitive technique for optimizing the F measure.
The idea is to further tune the weight of a single
parameter – mention penalty based on the devel-
opment set, after the training process completes.

This is based on the observation that by increas-
ing the value of the mention penalty, we are essen-
tially forcing our model to predict more mentions.
Therefore the recall is a monotonic function with
respect to the mention penalty. Based on this fact,
we use a simple search algorithm with a fixed step
size (we set it to 0.01) to determine the optimal
value of the modified mention penalty so that the
F measure of the development set is optimized.

4 Experiments

In this section, we present empirical evaluations.
Our main experiments were conducted on the stan-
dard ACE2004 and ACE2005 datasets which
contain overlapping mentions. Two additional ex-
periments on the GENIA and CONLL2003 dataset
were also conducted .

4.1 Results on ACE

Our primary experiments were conducted based
on the English portion of the ACE2004 dataset3

and the ACE2005 dataset4. Following previous
work, for ACE2004, we considered all documents
from arabic treebank, bnews, chinese treebank,
and nwire, and for ACE2005, we considered all
documents from bc, bn, nw, and wl . We randomly
split the documents for each dataset into three por-
tions: 80% for training, 10% for development, and
the remaining 10% for evaluations. The statistics
of the datasets are summarized in Table 15. We

can observe that overlapping mentions are com-
mon – over 30% of the sentences contain overlap-
ping mentions (see row 3 of the table). Mentions
can also be very long – over 5% of the mentions
consist of more than 6 words, and the longest men-
tion consists of 57 words.

We compared our system’s performance with
those of several baseline approaches. We first
built two simple baseline approaches based on se-
quence labelling models using the conditional ran-
dom fields (CRFs). Such approaches can not han-
dle overlapping mentions. To train such mod-
els, whenever two mentions overlap with one an-
other in the training set, we remove the mention
that is shorter in length. Following (Ratinov and
Roth, 2009), we considered the BIO (Begin, In-
side, Outside) approach and the BILOU (Begin,
Inside, Last, Outside, Unit) approach for design-
ing the output labels. Results show the BILOU ap-
proach yields better results. Similar observations
were reported in Ratinov and Roth (2009).

In the work of (Alex et al., 2007), the authors
proposed several approaches for building mod-
els to handle nested named entities in biomedi-
cal texts. Their best results were obtained from a
cascaded approach where they built one model for
each named entity class. Outputs from one model
can then served as the inputs to the next model
for predicting the named entity class of a differ-
ent type. One fundamental limitation of such an
approach is that it being unable to handle overlap-
ping mentions of the same type. Nevertheless, this
approach worked very well on both datasets. The
results are shown in the row of “CRF (CC)”.6

Another class of models that is often used in in-
formation extraction are the semi-Markov condi-
tional random fields (semi-CRFs) (Sarawagi and
Cohen, 2004). Semi-CRF models are able to cap-
ture the non-Markovian properties of mentions.
However, they are unable to handle nested or over-
lapping mentions. We thus used the same method
as discussed above to exclude certain mentions
for training. Such semi-CRF models typically as-
sume there is a length restriction for the mentions
– each mention can consist of up to c words – in
order to scale linearly. When such a restriction
is lifted, the time complexity of such models be-
comes quadratic in the number of words in the in-

6For all such linear chain CRF-related experiments, we
used the CRF++ toolkit (https://code.google.com/p/crfpp/)
with L-BFGS, which gives us the most competitive re-
sults over several different CRF implementations (see:
http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/benchmark.html).

length restriction, where c = 6, and the other with-
out a length restriction (c = ∞). For features de-
fined over the inputs, besides the Markovian fea-
tures described in Sec 3.5, we also used the sur-

The results of these two models are reported in the

estingly, imposing the length restriction appears to
be helpful for precision, and as a result it makes a
positive contribution towards the final F measure.

Our basic model (MH: mention hypergraph)
that optimizes the negative joint log likelihood is
able to obtain the best precision across these two
datasets. When the model is further augmented
with the F measure optimization step described in
Sec 3.7 (MH (F )) it consistently yields the best
results in terms of both recall score and F measure
across these two datasets.

4.1.1 Running Time

We also conducted controlled experiments to re-
port the actual execution time of our model and
make a comparison with the linear-chain CRF
model (BILOU approach). The experiments are
all conducted on the ACE2004 dataset on the same
machine. To make a proper comparison here,
we implemented the linear-chain CRF model us-
ing Java (the same language is used when imple-
menting our model), and employed the same data
structures for creating features as well as the same
learning and inference routines used by our men-
tion hypergraph model.

To understand how the features and speed
change as we increase the number of mention
types (i.e., semantic types), we also conducted ex-
periments where we increase the number of possi-
ble mention types. Specifically, we created sub-
types from each original type annotated in the
dataset. For example, we randomly replaced the
type “GPE” by sub-types “GPE1” or “GPE2” in
the dataset. This gave us 14 different mention
types. Similarly, we could randomly replace the
type “GPE” by sub-types “GPE1” – “GPE4”, re-

sulting in 28 different mention types in total. Our
purpose of doing so is to understand how the mod-
els behave when the number of possible mention
types becomes large. We found that training on the
entire training set of ACE2004 using the linear-
chain CRF model with a large number of men-
tion types was very expensive due to the extremely
large number of features involved. We instead
trained the models on the development set and pre-
sented decoding time on the test set.

Table 3 shows the results. We empirically cap-
tured the relationship between the speed of each
system (average number of words processed per
second) and the number of mention types. Specif-
ically, we found that as we linearly increased the
number of mention types, for the linear-chain CRF
model, the number of features grew quadratically
and the speed dropped quadratically, whereas for
our model, the number of features grew linearly
and the speed dropped linearly. This indicates
that our model is more scalable to large, practical
datasets with a large number of fine-grained men-
tion types.

4.1.2 Joint Modeling of Heads
We also conducted experiments on these two
datasets for the task of joint modeling of mention
boundaries, types and heads. We used the same
training and tuning methodology for optimizing
the F measure. In such experiments, we adopted
a very strict evaluation criterion: a predicted men-
tion is regarded as correct iff and only if its bound-
aries, type and head all exactly match those of the
gold standard.

We compared our system’s results with those of
several baseline approaches based on CRF where
the cascaded BILOU approach described above
was always used. Specifically, we considered ap-
proaches that always regarded the complete span
(CC-S), the first word (CC-F), and the last word
(CC-L) as the predicted mention’s head, respec-
tively. We also considered a cascaded approach
(CC-CC) where we first predicted mentions, and

then predicted their heads by following a simi-
lar approach used for predicting overlapping men-
tions discussed above. The first four rows of Ta-
ble 4 give the results of these baseline approaches.
We can observe that always predicting the last
word as the head gives the best performance. In-
spired by this, we performed a simple approach
by training a model presented in the previous sec-
tion without considering head information. When
making predictions, we always regarded the last
word of each predicted mention as its head. The
results for such an approach are given in the fifth
row of Table 4. The sixth row shows the results ob-
tained by optimizing our model’s objective func-
tion. The last row gives the results obtained by
tuning the mention penalty based on the develop-
ment set. As seen, our joint models significantly
outperformed all those baseline approaches. We
are not aware of any prior work in the literature
that performs joint modeling of mention bound-
aries, types, and heads.

4.2 Additional Experiments
We also additionally evaluated on the GENIA
dataset (v3.02) whose focus was on biomedical
related named entity recognition and classifica-
tion, where the entities may overlap with one an-
other. Furthermore, to see how our model works
on datasets where mentions do not overlap with
one another, we also conducted evaluations on the
standard CONLL2003 NER dataset.

4.2.1 Results on GENIA
We followed the description of Finkel and Man-
ning (2009) to set up our experiments on the GE-
NIA dataset. Specifically, we used the first 90% of
the sentences as the training data and the remain-
ing 10% as the evaluation data. We also adhered
to the paper’s prescription of collapsing all DNA
subtypes into DNA; RNA subtypes into RNA; and
all protein subtypes into protein. We kept cell line
and cell type, and removed all other entities.

To optimize the F measure, we further split the

training set into two portions. We trained a model
using the first 90% of the training data, and used
the remaining 10% for development. For features,
no POS and no bag-of-words features are used.

We compared our model’s performance with
that of a model based on a constituency parser pro-
posed by (Finkel and Manning, 2009), as well as
the semi-CRF model reported there. The results
are shown in Table 5. Our model yields a better
F measure than the semi-CRF model, but gives a
lower performance than the model of (Finkel and
Manning, 2009). We note that, however, these
results are not directly comparable. Specifically,
both of these two previous models relied on an ad-
ditional 200 million words from PubMed abstracts
to learn word clusters as additional features, which
we do not have access to.

One distinctive advantage of our model is the
efficiency and scalability. The model of (Finkel
and Manning, 2009) had a time complexity that is
cubic in the number of words in the input sentence.
In contrast, our model scales linearly as the length
of the input sentence increases. 7

4.2.2 Results on CONLL2003
To understand how well our model works on
datasets where mentions or entities do not overlap
with one another, we conducted additional experi-
ments on the standard dataset used in the CONLL
2003 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der, 2003), where the named entities strictly do
not overlap with one another. We compared our
system’s performance against that of a baseline
version of the state-of-the-art Illinois NER sys-
tem (Ratinov and Roth, 2009). Their system per-
formed sequential prediction over the input words
and adopted the BILOU approach. Their full
model also incorporates external knowledge re-
sources (e.g., gazetteers and word class).

In order to make a proper comparison with the
baseline version of their model, besides the gen-
eral features we mentioned earlier, we also fol-

7In our experiments, for this dataset our model tagged
over 5,000 words/second. In (Finkel and Manning, 2009),
the authors mentioned that their model tagged about 38
words/second, and the semi-CRF model tagged about 45
words/second. However, we note these numbers are not di-
rectly comparable due to the advancement of CPU speed.

months, dates and numbers. Table 6 shows that
our system gives an F measure that is compara-
ble to that of the baseline version of their system,
where no external resources are used.

This additional experiment showed that while
our model is designed for handling more real-
istic scenarios where mentions can overlap, it
yields a performance competitive to a state-of-the-
art system which only handles datasets with non-
overlapping mentions.

5 Conclusions

In this work, we have introduced a novel model
for the task of joint modeling of mention bound-
aries, types, as well as their heads. Unlike many
previous research efforts for mention extraction
and classification, our novel mention hypergraph
representations for compactly representing expo-
nentially many possible mentions enables a men-
tion’s boundaries, type and head information to be
jointly learned in a single framework. The model
scales linearly with respect to the number of words
in the input sentence, and performs exact learning
where a unique global optimum can be found. Em-
pirically, we have demonstrated the effectiveness
of such a model across several standard datasets.

Future work include explorations of efficient al-
gorithms for other information extraction tasks,
such as joint mention and relation extraction (Li
and Ji, 2014) and event extraction (Li et al., 2013).
