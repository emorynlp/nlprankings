Abstract

We investigate the order of mention for
objects in relational descriptions in visual
scenes. Existing work in the visual do-
main focuses on content selection for text
generation and relies primarily on tem-
plates to generate surface realizations from
underlying content choices. In contrast,
we seek to clarify the influence of visual
perception on the linguistic form (as op-
posed to the content) of descriptions, mod-
eling the variation in and constraints on
the surface orderings in a description. We
find previously-unknown effects of the vi-
sual characteristics of objects; specifically,
when a relational description involves a vi-
sually salient object, that object is more
likely to be mentioned first. We conduct
a detailed analysis of these patterns using
logistic regression, and also train and eval-
uate a classifier. Our methods yield signif-
icant improvement in classification accu-
racy over a naive baseline.

1 Introduction

Visual-world referring expression generation
(REG) is the task of instructing a listener how
to find an object (the target) in a visual scene.
In complicated scenes, people often produce
relational descriptions, in which the target object
is described relative to another (a landmark)
(Viethen and Dale, 2008). While existing REG
systems can generate relational descriptions,
they tend to focus on content selection (that is,
choosing an appropriate set of landmarks for
each object). Surface realization (turning the
selected content into a string of words) is handled

by simple heuristics, such as sets of templates.
Complex descriptions, however, have a non-trivial
information structure— objects are not mentioned
in an arbitrary order. Numerous studies in
non-visual domains show that English speakers
favor constructions that place familiar (given)
information before unfamiliar (new) (Bresnan et
al., 2007; Ward and Birner, 2001; Prince, 1981).
We show that this pattern also holds for visual-
world referring expressions (REs), and moreover,
that objects with sufficient visual prominence are
treated as given. Thus, we argue that the concept
of salience used in surface realization should
incorporate metrics from visual perception.

In this study, we create a model of information
ordering in complex relational descriptions. Us-
ing a discriminative classifier, we learn to predict
the information structuring strategies used in our
corpus. We compare these strategies to the typical
given/new pattern of English discourse. Experi-
ments on a corpus of descriptions of cartoon peo-
ple in the childrens’ book “Where’s Wally” (Hand-
ford, 1987), corpus described in (Clarke et al.,
2013), show that our approach significantly out-
performs a naive baseline, improving especially
on prediction of non-canonical orderings.

This study has three main contributions. First,
it demonstrates that humans use sophisticated in-
formation ordering strategies for REG, and there-
fore that the template strategies used in previous
work do not adequately model human production.
Second, it makes a practical proposal for an im-
proved model which is capable of predicting these
orderings; while this model is not a full-scale sur-
face realizer, we view it as an important interme-
diate step towards one. Finally, it makes a the-
oretical contribution: By linking the information
structures observed in the data to the existing re-

520



search on salience and information structure, we
show that visually prominent objects are treated
as part of common ground despite the lack of pre-
vious mention.

2 Related work

Computational models of REG (Krahmer and van
Deemter, 2012) focus mainly on content selection:
Given a list of objects in the scene and their visual
attributes, such models decide what information to
include in a description so as to specify the tar-
get object. Early systems (with the exception of
Dale and Haddock (1991)) did not produce rela-
tional descriptions. Nor did these systems model
the visual salience of the objects or attributes un-
der discussion.

Later models (Kelleher et al., 2005; Kelleher
and Kruijff, 2006; Duckham et al., 2010) intro-
duce simple models of visual salience, prompted
by psycholinguistic research which shows that ob-
jects are more likely to be selected as landmarks
when they are easy for an observer to find (Beun
and Cremers, 1998). Clarke et al. (2013) extend
these results with a more complicated model of
visual salience (Torralba et al., 2006). Fang et al.
(2013) similarly note that generated REs should
avoid information that is perceptually expensive to
obtain. However, these results focus on content se-
lection rather than surface realization.

In comparison to selection, surface realization
for REG has received little attention. Many re-
searchers do not even perform realization, but sim-
ply compare their systems’ selected content with
the gold standard under metrics like the Dice co-
efficient. The TUNA challenges (Gatt et al., 2008;
Gatt et al., 2009; Gatt and Belz, 2010) are an ex-
ception; participants were required to provide sur-
face realizations, which were evaluated via NIST,
BLEU and string edit distance. Many partici-
pants used a template-based realizer written by
Irene Langkilde-Geary, which imposes a fixed or-
dering on attributes like “size” and “color” but
has no provisions for relational descriptions. A
few participants created their own realizers. Brug-
man et al. (2009) describe a system with multi-
ple hand-written templates. Di Fabbrizio et al.
(2008) propose several learning-based systems;
the most effective were a dependency-based ap-
proach which learned precedence relationships be-
tween pairs of words, and a template-based ap-
proach which learned global orderings over sets of

attributes. Neither approach is designed to handle
relational descriptions, nor do they incorporate vi-
sual information. Duan et al. (2013), also studying
the Wally corpus, demonstrates that visual features
affect determiner choice for NPs, but do not study
information structure.

Several studies give basic principles for infor-
mation structure in English discourse. Prince
(1981) introduces the key distinctions between
discourse-old and new entities (previously men-
tioned vs not mentioned) and hearer-old and new
entities (familiar to the listener vs not familiar).
Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) extends the latter
distinction to a notion of common ground; entities
in the common ground are familiar to both par-
ticipants in the discourse, and each participant is
in turn aware of the other’s familiarity. As noted
by Prince (1981) and expanded on by Ward and
Birner (2001) and in Centering Theory (Grosz et
al., 1995), the first element in an English sentence
is generally reserved for old information, while
new information is usually placed at the end. For
instance, see these (contrived) examples:

(1) a. Obama adopted a dog named Bo.
b. #A dog named Bo was adopted by

Obama.

Ex. (1-a) demonstrates the standard order (un-
der the assumption that Obama is familiar to a
reader of this paper while Bo may not be). (1-b)
violates the ordering principles and is likely to
be judged less felicitous. Importantly, Obama is
hearer-old not because of a preceding discourse
mention but due to (assumed) general knowl-
edge; it is an unused (Prince, 1981), or existential
(Bean and Riloff, 1999) entity. General knowl-
edge shared by speakers of a community is one
way in which an entity enters the common ground.
Along with this shared socio-cultural background,
speakers may also share physical co-presence and
linguistic co-presence (Clark, 1996). They can in-
dicate salient entities, individuals, or entire events
by engaging their listener in joint attention via
pointing or gaze cueing (Baldwin, 1995; Carpen-
ter et al., 1998); in this paper, we demonstrate that
visual prominence is also sufficient.

Maienborn (2001) explicitly suggests that this
topic-comment structure principle is the motiva-
tion for the frequent appearance of locative modi-
fiers in clause-initial position; however, she gives
no felicity conditions on when this leftward move-
ment is expected. Since most of the modifiers in

521



this study are locatives, our data should be taken as
endorsing this theoretical position, but supplying
felicity conditions in terms of common ground.

These principles have been applied to compu-
tational surface realization in non-visual domains
(Webber, 2004; Nakatsu and White, 2010, and
others). Freer-word-order languages such as Ger-
man also have predictable information structures
which have been employed in surface realization
systems, but these require a different structural
analysis than in English (Zarrieß et al., 2012; Fil-
ippova and Strube, 2007).

3 Information structures in our corpus

In this section, we define the particular ordering
strategies which we investigate in the rest of the
paper. We begin by defining some terms: A re-
lational description includes two objects, the an-
chor, which is the object being located, and the
landmark, an object which is mentioned to make
it easier to locate the anchor. The anchor may be
the target of the entire expression, or it may in turn
serve as a landmark in another relational descrip-
tion (as in “the man next to the horse next to the
building” where “horse” serves as both a landmark
for “man” and an anchor for “building”.1 The
REs in this corpus reflect the variation in the way
speakers constructed their descriptions: Some pro-
duced multiple complete sentences; others used
abbreviated language and compacted their expres-
sion into a single sentence or phrase. In this pa-
per we use the term “ordering” to refer to speak-
ers’ decisions of whether to precede or postpose a
reference to one object relative to their reference
to another. In this way, the “syntax” of the de-
scription is built out of references to particular ob-
jects (the noun phrases) and the relationships be-
tween those references. Note that the references
may consist of a short phrase (“the man with the
sword”) or an entire clause (“he is standing and
holding a sword”)

In our corpus, speakers use three primary strate-
gies to order anchors and landmarks, exemplified
by the following REs from our corpus (shown with
bold for text describing the anchor and italics for
text for landmarks):

(2) Near the hut that is burning, there is a man
holding a lit torch in one hand, and a
sword in the other.

1In our examples below, the anchor is the target of the
overall expression, i.e., the intended referent in the REG task.

(3) Man closest to the rear tyre of the van.

(4) There is a person standing in the water
wearing a blue shirt and yellow hat

Ex. (2) places the landmark so that it precedes
the anchor; Ex. (3) shows the landmark follow-
ing it. Ex. (4) shows a more complex structure,
which we refer to as interleaved, where informa-
tion about the anchor is given in multiple phrases
and the landmark phrase appears between them.2

(These orders are determined with respect to the
first mention of the landmark.) We denote these
ordering strategies as PRECEDE, FOLLOW and IN-
TER respectively.

We also distinguish between landmarks which
are only mentioned in relation to an anchor and
those which are first introduced in a non-relative
construction such as “look at the X” or “there’s an
X”:

(5) There is a horse rearing up on its hind legs.
Behind the horse is a man laying down on
his back completely flat and straight.

Since these constructions establish the existence
of a landmark without immediately incorporating
it into the description, we denote these as ESTAB-
LISH constructions.

Finally, our annotation scheme distinguishes
between genuine landmarks (visible objects or
groups of objects in the scene) and image regions
like “the left” or “bottom center”:

(6) Bottom center, man looking left

4 Dataset

We use a collection of referring expressions
elicited on Mechanical Turk, previously described
in (Clarke et al., 2013).3 The dataset contains
descriptions of targets in 11 images from the
childrens’ book Where’s Wally4 (Handford, 1987;
Handford, 1988); in each image, 16 people were
designated as targets. Each participant saw each
scene only once. An example scene is shown in
Figure 1. The participant was instructed to type a
description of the person in the red box so that an-
other person viewing the same scene (but without
the box) would be able to find them; to make sure

2This structure is not syntactically discontinuous, but vi-
sually it is; if the listener wants to confirm these details visu-
ally, they must first look at the person, then look away at the
water and then look back at the person.

this was clear, as part of the study instructions,
they completed a few visual searches based on text
descriptions. The image in the figure also contains
a black box (not part of the initial stimulus), which
the annotator has added to designate the landmark
object “burning hut”). The dataset contains 1672
descriptions, contributed by 152 different partici-
pants (152 participants × 11 scenes).

The REs are annotated for visual and linguistic
content. The annotation scheme indicates which
substrings of the RE describe the target object, an-
other mentioned object or an image region. Ref-
erences to parts or attributes of objects are not
treated as separate objects; “a man holding torch
and sword” in Figure 1 is a single object. The
mentioned objects are linked to bounding boxes
(or for very large objects, bounding polygons) in
the image.

For each mention of a non-target object, the an-
notation indicates whether it is part of a relational
description of a specific anchor, and if so which; if
it is not, it receives an ESTABLISH tag. These an-
notations are used to determine the ordering strate-
gies used in this study. In some cases, the linkage
between objects is implicit:

(7) ...there are 4 men smoking... the man you
are looking for is the one [=of the 4 men]
leaning against a crate

In the above RE, 4 men is first introduced in an
ESTABLISH construction. The word “one” refers
implicitly to part of this set of men, so the annota-
tor marks a relational link from “4 men” to “one”.
In our analysis in this study, we treat the entity
“crates” as anchored to the target (“one”) on the
basis of this implicit link (so that this is an instance
of the PRECEDE-ESTABLISH pattern), but we do
not treat the hidden link itself as a mention or try
to predict its nonexistent “position” in the string.

5 Distribution of ordering strategies

We first describe the distribution of these strate-
gies across the corpus as a whole. As shown in Ta-
ble 1, landmarks are ordered about equally to the
FOLLOW or PRECEDE of the objects they help to
locate. Regions, on the other hand, prefer the PRE-
CEDE ordering. The INTER ordering is less com-
mon, but still quite well-represented. The ESTAB-
LISH construction (initial “there is” or “look at”)
occurs only with PRECEDE ordering, and indeed
can be viewed as a syntactic strategy for achieving
such an order. We will explain these characteristic

patterns in linguistic terms in Section 7.
As in most discourse tasks (Ford and Olson,

1975; Pechmann, 2009), speakers display a fair
amount of variability. To measure this, we exam-
ine each anchor/landmark pair which is mentioned
by more than one speaker, and compute how often
these speakers use the same strategy. There are
664 such pairs,5 appearing a total of 2361 times
in the corpus.6 Of these, 66% agree on the direc-
tional strategy.7 Separately, 14% of the expres-
sions use an ESTABLISH construction, and 43% of
these are agreed on by the majority. (The remain-
ing variation could in principle have two sources:
The content of the expression as a whole could af-
fect the realization of a particular pair of objects,
or individual speakers might simply differ in their
usage patterns.) Nonetheless, there is a good deal
of regularity in speakers’ decisions. In the rest of
the paper, we attempt to model and predict this
regularity.

5286 of these pairs are mentioned by exactly two speakers.
6This is more than the total number of referring expres-

sions in the corpus, because many of the REs contain multiple
pairs of entities.

7If strategies were assigned randomly using the overall
marginals, we would expect only 34% agreement. Using this
method of calculating chance agreement, we would obtain a
Cohen’s κ of .48.

An additional 24 landmarks occur with no associ-
ated anchor (and therefore no discernible order).

6 Visual and non-visual information

Since visual properties are known to affect land-
mark selection (Kelleher et al., 2005; Viethen and
Dale, 2008), we expect them to influence informa-
tion structure as well. Our system uses three visual
properties to predict information structure; we se-
lect properties that are known from previous work
to help predict whether a landmark will be men-
tioned. These properties are the area of the an-
chor and landmark, the distance between them
(Golland et al., 2010, among others) and their cen-
trality (centr.) (distance from the center of the
screen) (Kelleher et al., 2005).8 These properties
are all indicators of visual salience (Toet, 2011),
the property which makes objects in a scene easy
to find quickly (Wolfe, 2012) and tends to draw
initial gaze fixations (Itti and Koch, 2000). We
also include indicators for whether the anchor is
the target object, and whether the landmark is an
image region (reg) (see section 3).

In addition, we give a few non-visual features
derived from the content structure. These include
the number of dependents (landmarks which re-
late to each object in the description) and the num-
ber of descendants (the direct dependents, their
dependents and so forth). When the speaker has
to arrange a large number of landmarks, they tend
to vary the ordering more, because of heavy-shift
effects (White and Rajkumar, 2012) and the diffi-
culty of preposing more than one constituent.

7 Regression analysis

To gain some insight into the influence of differ-
ent features, we conduct a logistic regression anal-
ysis. For each pair of (anchor, landmark) occur-

8Following Clarke et al. (2013), we attempted to also
measuring distinctiveness from the background using a per-
ceptual model of visual salience (Torralba et al., 2006). Al-
though this measure is effective in predicting landmark selec-
tion, it proves uninformative here for predicting information
structure, yielding no significant effects in any analyses.

ring in a relational description, we attempt to pre-
dict the manner of realization (direction and ES-
TABLISH). We performed a logistic regression for
each class (one-vs-all); thus there are four regres-
sors in total, making 0-1 predictions for PRECEDE,
PRECEDE-ESTABLISH, INTER and FOLLOW.

Because their distributions are heavily skewed,
area is transformed to square root area and dis-
tance/centrality values are log-transformed as in
Clarke et al. (2013).9 Features are scaled to zero
mean and unit variance. Finally, centrality values
are negated so that higher values indicate more
central objects; this is for ease of interpretation.
We fit models using random intercepts for speaker
and image using the LME4 package (Bates et al.,
2011), then removed all fixed effects which were
never significant for any class and reran the anal-
ysis until a minimal model was reached (Crawley,
2007). This minimization removed the number of
descendants features (but kept number of direct
dependents). Table 2 shows the significant coef-
ficients, standard deviations and Z-scores. (Note
that as the regressions are separate, the coefficients
are comparable reading down columns, but not
across rows).

The regression analysis shows that as landmarks
get larger, they are more likely to be realized with
the PRECEDE (β = 3.27) or INTER (β = 1.28)
strategies (but not PRECEDE-ESTABLISH) and less
likely (β = −3.76) to be placed following. (This
does not appear to be the case for landmarks that
are central; these are slightly more likely to be
ordered FOLLOW (β = .81).) The PRECEDE-
ESTABLISH construction is neither favored nor
disfavored by landmark area. It does, however,
have a strong preference for landmarks with many
dependents (β = 2.38), since these are more nat-
urally realized in the clause-final position intro-
duced by a “There is X”-type construction. In con-
trast, landmarks with many dependents disfavor
the INTER strategy (β = −1.07), since this would
require placing a heavy NP in a central rather than
rightward position.

There are also a few effects of visual features
of the anchor objects. Larger anchors (which are
easier to see in their own right) prefer landmarks
to FOLLOW (β = .35). This presumably reflects
the fact that, since the listener is more likely to
see them quickly, such anchors are more often re-

9We use these continuous values in our analysis; our clas-
sifier model (below) uses discretized area, distance and cen-
trality.

alized at the start of an expression. (Clarke et al.
(2013) show that they have fewer landmarks over-
all.) Again, the effect of centrality is counterin-
tuitive, but weak (β = .81). Anchors with more
dependents are slightly more likely to use the IN-
TER slot (β = .22), suggesting that the various
dependents are spread syntactically throughout the
expression.

Although distance and centrality are weak in-
dicators in this dataset, area shows strong effects
which support our conclusion that visual salience
behaves like discourse salience. The standard in-
formation order of English clauses places given in-
formation first and new information later (Prince,
1981). Thus, we observe that the non-right or-
ders are used for larger objects, which is what we
would expect if their visual perceptibility is suffi-
cient to place them in common ground despite the
lack of a previous mention.10 On the other hand,
the FOLLOW order is used for smaller objects that
cannot be assumed to be part of common ground
(and are therefore treated as new).

The use of ESTABLISH constructions for mid-
sized objects also makes sense on theoretical
grounds. ESTABLISH constructions are a way
of achieving the PRECEDE information structure,
which places the landmark first— and this makes
sense primarily if the landmark is reasonably
salient, since otherwise it will not be found any
faster than the target. On the other hand, most
of the constructions we discuss as ESTABLISH,

10Prince (1981) discusses other discourse-new items that
are nonetheless treated as familiar, like “The FBI”, under the
name unused (that is, available, but not previously in use in
the discourse).

such as existential “there is”, require their object
to be discourse-new (Ward and Birner, 1995); it
would be infelicitous to start a description by stat-
ing the existence of something already in the com-
mon ground “there is a sky, and it is blue. . . ”
Thus, it makes sense that neither large or small
objects favor the use of this construction; it can be
used to foreground an object which is not salient
enough to be assumed in common ground, but is
salient enough to find without a great deal of vi-
sual search.

8 Information structure prediction

In this section, we experiment with an idealized
version of the information structuring task. We
provide our system with gold standard content
selection— we know which objects will be men-
tioned, and if they serve as landmarks, we know
the anchor they describe. However, we do not
know which information strategies will be used to
order them; our task is to predict this. In doing
so, we are working with an idealized version of
the standard generation pipeline, which often op-
erates as a two-stage process, with content selec-
tion followed by surface realization. Information
structure prediction is intermediate between these
two stages; once we have decided which objects
to mention (or in concert), we would like to de-
cide what order to mention them in.

We set up the prediction task as in the pre-
vious section: Given an anchor/landmark pair,
our system must decide what direction and ES-
TABLISH status to assign it. However, here we
evaluate the system as a classifier. We treat an-
chor/landmark pair as independent from the others

(including other pairs from the same description);
during development, we investigated a parser-like
structured classifier based on (Socher et al., 2011;
Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009) that jointly clas-
sified all the relational descriptions in a single ut-
terance at once, but results did not improve over
the classifier system, perhaps because on average
the trees are fairly shallow.

8.1 Discriminative comparison

We train a discriminative multilabel classifier us-
ing maximum entropy.11 We predict EST-DIR pairs
given a set of discrete features shown in Table
3. This setup differs slightly from the previous
section (which used one-vs-all); we are attempt-
ing to conform to the standard practices of psy-
cholinguistics and computational linguistics re-
spectively. Area, salience, distance to center and
inter-object distance values are discretized by de-
termining in which quartile of the training set each
value falls (lowest 25%, mid-low, mid-high, high-
est 25%). Our initial model used continuous val-
ues as in the previous section, but results were
somewhat poorer, suggesting some of these fea-
tures may have nonlinear effects.

8.2 Experiments

We hold out three images (vikings, airport,
blackandwhite) as a development set. In test, we
exclude these 3 documents and use the other 8
for evaluation. In both development and test, we
conduct experiments by crossvalidation, testing on
one document at a time and training on the other
ten.12

11Learned using the Theano neural-network package
(Bergstra et al., 2010) and stochastic gradient descent code
from deeplearning.net/tutorial (Bengio, 2009).

12This means we always use 10 of the 11 documents for
training, whether in dev or test, but we didn’t do error anal-

We report two trivial baseline strategies, all
landmarks following (the best baseline for over-
all accuracy) and all landmarks preceding (the best
baseline for predicting the direction, but not as
good overall because the PRECEDE predictions are
split between ESTABLISH and not ESTABLISH).
Our preliminary analysis shows that regions have
a strong tendency to precede their anchors, so we
also report results for a baseline using this pat-
tern (regions preceding, everything else follow-
ing). We believe this baseline pattern is the one
which would be learned as a template by previ-
ous systems like Di Fabbrizio et al. (2008), since
this system can learn relationships between broad
types of entities (target, landmark and region) but
does not use visual features of the actual entities
in the scene to make any finer distinctions.

We also provide two “inter-subject” oracle
scores intended to estimate the performance ceil-
ing imposed by human variability. This oracle
assigns each anchor/landmark pair the direction
and ESTABLISH status assigned by the majority
of speakers who mentioned that pair. The “mul-
tiple mentions” estimate of agreement is the one
mentioned in Section 5; it was based only on pairs
mentioned by multiple speakers. The “all” esti-
mate is based on all objects; it is higher because,
for pairs mentioned by only one speaker, it is by
definition perfect. Our system’s use of the num-
ber of descendants feature is not captured by this
oracle— these features capture information about
a particular speaker’s content plan beyond their
decision to mention a particular pair— but we sus-
pect that the oracle’s performance will nonetheless
be hard for any practical system to beat.

We report gross accuracy (correctly predicting
both DIR and ESTABLISH) for relational pairs (Ta-
ble 5), and also decompose by direction (Table 4)
and ESTABLISH status (Table 6).

The baseline correctly predicts 43% of pairs,
implying that this pattern (regions precede, land-
marks follow) covers a bit under half the data. The
classifier improves this to 52%. When predicting
the direction alone, the best baseline (PRECEDE)
scores 42%; the classifier scores 57%. All sys-
tem scores are significantly better than the base-
line (sign test on pairs, p < 0.01). In predictions
of ESTABLISH tags, our result is a 60% f-score,
which is indistinguishable from the lower bound

ysis on the training examples. Data size does appear to mat-
ter; training on 8 documents at a time and testing on 3 yields
poorer results.

9 Conclusions

The results of this study show that the information
structure of relational descriptions is highly vari-
able, and depends on notions of salience and com-
mon ground that are difficult to capture with tem-
plates or simple case-based rules. This suggests
that the question of realization for visual-word re-
ferring expressions may need to be reopened. A
data-driven approach not only allows better pre-
diction of which strategy will be used (reducing
error by 9% absolute, 16% relative) but also en-
ables us to analyze the pattern and conclude that
the visual salience of an object acts in the same
way as discourse salience.

Several open questions remain. One is the fail-
ure of the Torralba et al. (2006) visual distinctive-

ness model to make any difference: Is this actually
a perceptual fact, or does it merely demonstrate
that the model is not as predictive of human atten-
tional patterns as we would like? More important
is the question of what lies behind the substantial
variations we observe across individuals. These
may reflect truly different strategies; for instance,
some speakers may generate REs incrementally as
they scan the image (Pechmann, 2009) while oth-
ers perform a more complete scan before begin-
ning (Gatt et al., 2012). We suspect answering
this question is beyond the scope of corpus stud-
ies, and intend to investigate via psycholinguistic
experiments using an eyetracker.

Another question is to what extend the patterns
we observe are intended to facilitate listeners’ vi-
sual search (an audience design hypothesis) ver-
sus speakers’ efficient construction of utterances.
This study focused on predicting speaker behavior,
while acknowledging that the utterances speakers
produce are not always optimal for listeners (Belz
and Gatt, 2008). However, we suspect that in this
case, putting easy-to-see objects early really does
help listeners; we are currently planning percep-
tion experiments to test this hypothesis.

Finally, we intend to incorporate the visual fea-
tures used in this study into a full-scale realization
system. This will enable us to create more human-
like REs for visual domains. Such REs can be in-
corporated into natural language systems for a va-
riety of interactive visual-world tasks.
