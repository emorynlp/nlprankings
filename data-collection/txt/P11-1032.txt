Abstract

Consumers increasingly rate, review and re-
search products online (Jansen, 2010; Litvin
et al., 2008). Consequently, websites con-
taining consumer reviews are becoming tar-
gets of opinion spam. While recent work
has focused primarily on manually identifi-
able instances of opinion spam, in this work
we study deceptive opinion spam—fictitious
opinions that have been deliberately written to
sound authentic. Integrating work from psy-
chology and computational linguistics, we de-
velop and compare three approaches to detect-
ing deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately
develop a classifier that is nearly 90% accurate
on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset.
Based on feature analysis of our learned mod-
els, we additionally make several theoretical
contributions, including revealing a relation-
ship between deceptive opinions and imagina-
tive writing.

1 Introduction

With the ever-increasing popularity of review web-
sites that feature user-generated opinions (e.g.,
TripAdvisor1 and Yelp2), there comes an increasing
potential for monetary gain through opinion spam—
inappropriate or fraudulent reviews. Opinion spam
can range from annoying self-promotion of an un-
related website or blog to deliberate review fraud,
as in the recent case3 of a Belkin employee who

hired people to write positive reviews for an other-
wise poorly reviewed product.4

While other kinds of spam have received consid-
erable computational attention, regrettably there has
been little work to date (see Section 2) on opinion
spam detection. Furthermore, most previous work in
the area has focused on the detection of DISRUPTIVE
OPINION SPAM—uncontroversial instances of spam
that are easily identified by a human reader, e.g., ad-
vertisements, questions, and other irrelevant or non-
opinion text (Jindal and Liu, 2008). And while the
presence of disruptive opinion spam is certainly a
nuisance, the risk it poses to the user is minimal,
since the user can always choose to ignore it.

We focus here on a potentially more insidi-
ous type of opinion spam: DECEPTIVE OPINION
SPAM—fictitious opinions that have been deliber-
ately written to sound authentic, in order to deceive
the reader. For example, one of the following two
hotel reviews is truthful and the other is deceptive
opinion spam:

1. I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business
and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is
tops. The service at the hotel is first class. The rooms
are modern and very comfortable. The location is per-
fect within walking distance to all of the great sights and
restaurants. Highly recommend to both business trav-
ellers and couples.

2. My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel
for our anniversary. This place is fantastic! We knew
as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! The
rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and
wonderful!! The area of the hotel is great, since I love
to shop I couldn’t ask for more!! We will definatly be

4It is also possible for opinion spam to be negative, poten-
tially in order to sully the reputation of a competitor.

back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James
Chicago.

Typically, these deceptive opinions are neither
easily ignored nor even identifiable by a human
reader;5 consequently, there are few good sources
of labeled data for this research. Indeed, in the ab-
sence of gold-standard data, related studies (see Sec-
tion 2) have been forced to utilize ad hoc procedures
for evaluation. In contrast, one contribution of the
work presented here is the creation of the first large-
scale, publicly available6 dataset for deceptive opin-
ion spam research, containing 400 truthful and 400
gold-standard deceptive reviews.

To obtain a deeper understanding of the nature of
deceptive opinion spam, we explore the relative util-
ity of three potentially complementary framings of
our problem. Specifically, we view the task as: (a)
a standard text categorization task, in which we use
n-gram–based classifiers to label opinions as either
deceptive or truthful (Joachims, 1998; Sebastiani,
2002); (b) an instance of psycholinguistic decep-
tion detection, in which we expect deceptive state-
ments to exemplify the psychological effects of ly-
ing, such as increased negative emotion and psycho-
logical distancing (Hancock et al., 2008; Newman et
al., 2003); and, (c) a problem of genre identification,
in which we view deceptive and truthful writing as
sub-genres of imaginative and informative writing,
respectively (Biber et al., 1999; Rayson et al., 2001).

We compare the performance of each approach
on our novel dataset. Particularly, we find that ma-
chine learning classifiers trained on features tradi-
tionally employed in (a) psychological studies of
deception and (b) genre identification are both out-
performed at statistically significant levels by n-
gram–based text categorization techniques. Notably,
a combined classifier with both n-gram and psy-
chological deception features achieves nearly 90%
cross-validated accuracy on this task. In contrast,
we find deceptive opinion spam detection to be well
beyond the capabilities of most human judges, who
perform roughly at-chance—a finding that is consis-
tent with decades of traditional deception detection
research (Bond and DePaulo, 2006).

Additionally, we make several theoretical con-
tributions based on an examination of the feature
weights learned by our machine learning classifiers.
Specifically, we shed light on an ongoing debate in
the deception literature regarding the importance of
considering the context and motivation of a decep-
tion, rather than simply identifying a universal set
of deception cues. We also present findings that are
consistent with recent work highlighting the difficul-
ties that liars have encoding spatial information (Vrij
et al., 2009). Lastly, our study of deceptive opinion
spam detection as a genre identification problem re-
veals relationships between deceptive opinions and
imaginative writing, and between truthful opinions
and informative writing.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in
Section 2, we summarize related work; in Section 3,
we explain our methodology for gathering data and
evaluate human performance; in Section 4, we de-
scribe the features and classifiers employed by our
three automated detection approaches; in Section 5,
we present and discuss experimental results; finally,
conclusions and directions for future work are given
in Section 6.

2 Related Work

Spam has historically been studied in the contexts of
e-mail (Drucker et al., 2002), and the Web (Gyöngyi
et al., 2004; Ntoulas et al., 2006). Recently, re-
searchers have began to look at opinion spam as
well (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Wu et al., 2010; Yoo
and Gretzel, 2009).

Jindal and Liu (2008) find that opinion spam is
both widespread and different in nature from either
e-mail or Web spam. Using product review data,
and in the absence of gold-standard deceptive opin-
ions, they train models using features based on the
review text, reviewer, and product, to distinguish
between duplicate opinions7 (considered deceptive
spam) and non-duplicate opinions (considered truth-
ful). Wu et al. (2010) propose an alternative strategy
for detecting deceptive opinion spam in the absence

7Duplicate (or near-duplicate) opinions are opinions that ap-
pear more than once in the corpus with the same (or similar)
text. While these opinions are likely to be deceptive, they are
unlikely to be representative of deceptive opinion spam in gen-
eral. Moreover, they are potentially detectable via off-the-shelf
plagiarism detection software.

of gold-standard data, based on the distortion of pop-
ularity rankings. Both of these heuristic evaluation
approaches are unnecessary in our work, since we
compare gold-standard deceptive and truthful opin-
ions.

Yoo and Gretzel (2009) gather 40 truthful and 42
deceptive hotel reviews and, using a standard statis-
tical test, manually compare the psychologically rel-
evant linguistic differences between them. In con-
trast, we create a much larger dataset of 800 opin-
ions that we use to develop and evaluate automated
deception classifiers.

Research has also been conducted on the re-
lated task of psycholinguistic deception detection.
Newman et al. (2003), and later Mihalcea and
Strapparava (2009), ask participants to give both
their true and untrue views on personal issues
(e.g., their stance on the death penalty). Zhou et
al. (2004; 2008) consider computer-mediated decep-
tion in role-playing games designed to be played
over instant messaging and e-mail. However, while
these studies compare n-gram–based deception clas-
sifiers to a random guess baseline of 50%, we addi-
tionally evaluate and compare two other computa-
tional approaches (described in Section 4), as well
as the performance of human judges (described in
Section 3.3).

Lastly, automatic approaches to determining re-
view quality have been studied—directly (Weimer
et al., 2007), and in the contexts of helpful-
ness (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2009; Kim et
al., 2006; O’Mahony and Smyth, 2009) and credibil-
ity (Weerkamp and De Rijke, 2008). Unfortunately,
most measures of quality employed in those works
are based exclusively on human judgments, which
we find in Section 3 to be poorly calibrated to de-
tecting deceptive opinion spam.

3 Dataset Construction and Human
Performance

While truthful opinions are ubiquitous online, de-
ceptive opinions are difficult to obtain without re-
sorting to heuristic methods (Jindal and Liu, 2008;
Wu et al., 2010). In this section, we report our ef-
forts to gather (and validate with human judgments)
the first publicly available opinion spam dataset with
gold-standard deceptive opinions.

Following the work of Yoo and Gretzel (2009), we
compare truthful and deceptive positive reviews for
hotels found on TripAdvisor. Specifically, we mine
all 5-star truthful reviews from the 20 most popular
hotels on TripAdvisor8 in the Chicago area.9 De-
ceptive opinions are gathered for those same 20 ho-
tels using Amazon Mechanical Turk10 (AMT). Be-
low, we provide details of the collection methodolo-
gies for deceptive (Section 3.1) and truthful opinions
(Section 3.2). Ultimately, we collect 20 truthful and
20 deceptive opinions for each of the 20 chosen ho-
tels (800 opinions total).

3.1 Deceptive opinions via Mechanical Turk

Crowdsourcing services such as AMT have made
large-scale data annotation and collection efforts fi-
nancially affordable by granting anyone with ba-
sic programming skills access to a marketplace of
anonymous online workers (known as Turkers) will-
ing to complete small tasks.

To solicit gold-standard deceptive opinion spam
using AMT, we create a pool of 400 Human-
Intelligence Tasks (HITs) and allocate them evenly
across our 20 chosen hotels. To ensure that opin-
ions are written by unique authors, we allow only a
single submission per Turker. We also restrict our
task to Turkers who are located in the United States,
and who maintain an approval rating of at least 90%.
Turkers are allowed a maximum of 30 minutes to
work on the HIT, and are paid one US dollar for an
accepted submission.

Each HIT presents the Turker with the name and
website of a hotel. The HIT instructions ask the
Turker to assume that they work for the hotel’s mar-
keting department, and to pretend that their boss
wants them to write a fake review (as if they were
a customer) to be posted on a travel review website;
additionally, the review needs to sound realistic and
portray the hotel in a positive light. A disclaimer

8TripAdvisor utilizes a proprietary ranking system to assess
hotel popularity. We chose the 20 hotels with the greatest num-
ber of reviews, irrespective of the TripAdvisor ranking.

9It has been hypothesized that popular offerings are less
likely to become targets of deceptive opinion spam, since the
relative impact of the spam in such cases is small (Jindal and
Liu, 2008; Lim et al., 2010). By considering only the most
popular hotels, we hope to minimize the risk of mining opinion
spam and labeling it as truthful.

indicates that any submission found to be of insuffi-
cient quality (e.g., written for the wrong hotel, unin-
telligible, unreasonably short,11 plagiarized,12 etc.)
will be rejected.

It took approximately 14 days to collect 400 sat-
isfactory deceptive opinions. Descriptive statistics
appear in Table 1. Submissions vary quite dramati-
cally both in length, and time spent on the task. Par-
ticularly, nearly 12% of the submissions were com-
pleted in under one minute. Surprisingly, an inde-
pendent two-tailed t-test between the mean length of
these submissions (¯̀t<1) and the other submissions
(¯̀t≥1) reveals no significant difference (p = 0.83).
We suspect that these “quick” users may have started
working prior to having formally accepted the HIT,
presumably to circumvent the imposed time limit.
Indeed, the quickest submission took just 5 seconds
and contained 114 words.

3.2 Truthful opinions from TripAdvisor
For truthful opinions, we mine all 6,977 reviews
from the 20 most popular Chicago hotels on
TripAdvisor. From these we eliminate:

• 3,130 non-5-star reviews;
• 41 non-English reviews;13

• 75 reviews with fewer than 150 characters
since, by construction, deceptive opinions are

11A submission is considered unreasonably short if it con-
tains fewer than 150 characters.

12Submissions are individually checked for plagiarism at

at least 150 characters long (see footnote 11 in
Section 3.1);
• 1,607 reviews written by first-time authors—

new users who have not previously posted an
opinion on TripAdvisor—since these opinions
are more likely to contain opinion spam, which
would reduce the integrity of our truthful re-
view data (Wu et al., 2010).

Finally, we balance the number of truthful and
deceptive opinions by selecting 400 of the remain-
ing 2,124 truthful reviews, such that the document
lengths of the selected truthful reviews are similarly
distributed to those of the deceptive reviews. Work
by Serrano et al. (2009) suggests that a log-normal
distribution is appropriate for modeling document
lengths. Thus, for each of the 20 chosen hotels, we
select 20 truthful reviews from a log-normal (left-
truncated at 150 characters) distribution fit to the
lengths of the deceptive reviews.14 Combined with
the 400 deceptive reviews gathered in Section 3.1
this yields our final dataset of 800 reviews.

3.3 Human performance
Assessing human deception detection performance
is important for several reasons. First, there are few
other baselines for our classification task; indeed, re-
lated studies (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Mihalcea and
Strapparava, 2009) have only considered a random
guess baseline. Second, assessing human perfor-
mance is necessary to validate the deceptive opin-
ions gathered in Section 3.1. If human performance
is low, then our deceptive opinions are convincing,
and therefore, deserving of further attention.

Our initial approach to assessing human perfor-
mance on this task was with Mechanical Turk. Un-
fortunately, we found that some Turkers selected
among the choices seemingly at random, presum-
ably to maximize their hourly earnings by obviating
the need to read the review. While a similar effect
has been observed previously (Akkaya et al., 2010),
there remains no universal solution.

Instead, we solicit the help of three volunteer un-
dergraduate university students to make judgments
on a subset of our data. This balanced subset, cor-
responding to the first fold of our cross-validation

14We use the R package GAMLSS (Rigby and Stasinopoulos,
2005) to fit the left-truncated log-normal distribution.

experiments described in Section 5, contains all 40
reviews from each of four randomly chosen hotels.
Unlike the Turkers, our student volunteers are not
offered a monetary reward. Consequently, we con-
sider their judgements to be more honest than those
obtained via AMT.

Additionally, to test the extent to which the in-
dividual human judges are biased, we evaluate the
performance of two virtual meta-judges. Specifi-
cally, the MAJORITY meta-judge predicts “decep-
tive” when at least two out of three human judges
believe the review to be deceptive, and the SKEP-
TIC meta-judge predicts “deceptive” when any hu-
man judge believes the review to be deceptive.

Human and meta-judge performance is given in
Table 2. It is clear from the results that human
judges are not particularly effective at this task. In-
deed, a two-tailed binomial test fails to reject the
null hypothesis that JUDGE 2 and JUDGE 3 per-
form at-chance (p = 0.003, 0.10, 0.48 for the three
judges, respectively). Furthermore, all three judges
suffer from truth-bias (Vrij, 2008), a common find-
ing in deception detection research in which hu-
man judges are more likely to classify an opinion
as truthful than deceptive. In fact, JUDGE 2 clas-
sified fewer than 12% of the opinions as decep-
tive! Interestingly, this bias is effectively smoothed
by the SKEPTIC meta-judge, which produces nearly
perfectly class-balanced predictions. A subsequent
reevaluation of human performance on this task sug-
gests that the truth-bias can be reduced if judges
are given the class-proportions in advance, although
such prior knowledge is unrealistic; and ultimately,
performance remains similar to that of Table 2.

Inter-annotator agreement among the three
judges, computed using Fleiss’ kappa, is 0.11.
While there is no precise rule for interpreting
kappa scores, Landis and Koch (1977) suggest

that scores in the range (0.00, 0.20] correspond
to “slight agreement” between annotators. The
largest pairwise Cohen’s kappa is 0.12, between
JUDGE 2 and JUDGE 3—a value far below generally
accepted pairwise agreement levels. We suspect
that agreement among our human judges is so
low precisely because humans are poor judges of
deception (Vrij, 2008), and therefore they perform
nearly at-chance respective to one another.

4 Automated Approaches to Deceptive
Opinion Spam Detection

We consider three automated approaches to detect-
ing deceptive opinion spam, each of which utilizes
classifiers (described in Section 4.4) trained on the
dataset of Section 3. The features employed by each
strategy are outlined here.

4.1 Genre identification
Work in computational linguistics has shown that
the frequency distribution of part-of-speech (POS)
tags in a text is often dependent on the genre of the
text (Biber et al., 1999; Rayson et al., 2001). In our
genre identification approach to deceptive opinion
spam detection, we test if such a relationship exists
for truthful and deceptive reviews by constructing,
for each review, features based on the frequencies of
each POS tag.15 These features are also intended to
provide a good baseline with which to compare our
other automated approaches.

4.2 Psycholinguistic deception detection
The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)
software (Pennebaker et al., 2007) is a popular au-
tomated text analysis tool used widely in the so-
cial sciences. It has been used to detect personality

15We use the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) to
obtain the relative POS frequencies.

traits (Mairesse et al., 2007), to study tutoring dy-
namics (Cade et al., 2010), and, most relevantly, to
analyze deception (Hancock et al., 2008; Mihalcea
and Strapparava, 2009; Vrij et al., 2007).

While LIWC does not include a text classifier, we
can create one with features derived from the LIWC
output. In particular, LIWC counts and groups
the number of instances of nearly 4,500 keywords
into 80 psychologically meaningful dimensions. We
construct one feature for each of the 80 LIWC di-
mensions, which can be summarized broadly under
the following four categories:

1. Linguistic processes: Functional aspects of text
(e.g., the average number of words per sen-
tence, the rate of misspelling, swearing, etc.)

2. Psychological processes: Includes all social,
emotional, cognitive, perceptual and biological
processes, as well as anything related to time or
space.

3. Personal concerns: Any references to work,
leisure, money, religion, etc.

4. Spoken categories: Primarily filler and agree-
ment words.

While other features have been considered in past
deception detection work, notably those of Zhou et
al. (2004), early experiments found LIWC features
to perform best. Indeed, the LIWC2007 software
used in our experiments subsumes most of the fea-
tures introduced in other work. Thus, we focus our
psycholinguistic approach to deception detection on
LIWC-based features.

4.3 Text categorization

In contrast to the other strategies just discussed,
our text categorization approach to deception de-
tection allows us to model both content and con-
text with n-gram features. Specifically, we consider
the following three n-gram feature sets, with the
corresponding features lowercased and unstemmed:
UNIGRAMS, BIGRAMS+, TRIGRAMS+, where the
superscript + indicates that the feature set subsumes
the preceding feature set.

4.4 Classifiers

Features from the three approaches just introduced
are used to train Naı̈ve Bayes and Support Vector

Machine classifiers, both of which have performed
well in related work (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Mihalcea
and Strapparava, 2009; Zhou et al., 2008).

For a document ~x, with label y, the Naı̈ve Bayes
(NB) classifier gives us the following decision rule:

ŷ = arg max
c

Pr(y = c) · Pr(~x | y = c) (1)

When the class prior is uniform, for example
when the classes are balanced (as in our case), (1)
can be simplified to the maximum likelihood classi-
fier (Peng and Schuurmans, 2003):

ŷ = arg max
c

Pr(~x | y = c) (2)

Under (2), both the NB classifier used by Mihal-
cea and Strapparava (2009) and the language model
classifier used by Zhou et al. (2008) are equivalent.
Thus, following Zhou et al. (2008), we use the SRI
Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to esti-
mate individual language models, Pr(~x | y = c),
for truthful and deceptive opinions. We consider
all three n-gram feature sets, namely UNIGRAMS,
BIGRAMS+, and TRIGRAMS+, with corresponding
language models smoothed using the interpolated
Kneser-Ney method (Chen and Goodman, 1996).

We also train Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers, which find a high-dimensional separating
hyperplane between two groups of data. To simplify
feature analysis in Section 5, we restrict our evalu-
ation to linear SVMs, which learn a weight vector
~w and bias term b, such that a document ~x can be
classified by:

ŷ = sign(~w · ~x + b) (3)

We use SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) to train our
linear SVM models on all three approaches and
feature sets described above, namely POS, LIWC,
UNIGRAMS, BIGRAMS+, and TRIGRAMS+. We also
evaluate every combination of these features, but
for brevity include only LIWC+BIGRAMS+, which
performs best. Following standard practice, doc-
ument vectors are normalized to unit-length. For
LIWC+BIGRAMS+, we unit-length normalize LIWC
and BIGRAMS+ features individually before com-
bining them.

positive and false negative rates, as suggested by Forman and Scholz (2009). Human performance is repeated here for
JUDGE 1, JUDGE 2 and the SKEPTIC meta-judge, although they cannot be directly compared since the 160-opinion
subset on which they are assessed only corresponds to the first cross-validation fold.

5 Results and Discussion

The deception detection strategies described in Sec-
tion 4 are evaluated using a 5-fold nested cross-
validation (CV) procedure (Quadrianto et al., 2009),
where model parameters are selected for each test
fold based on standard CV experiments on the train-
ing folds. Folds are selected so that each contains all
reviews from four hotels; thus, learned models are
always evaluated on reviews from unseen hotels.

Results appear in Table 3. We observe that auto-
mated classifiers outperform human judges for every
metric, except truthful recall where JUDGE 2 per-
forms best.16 However, this is expected given that
untrained humans often focus on unreliable cues to
deception (Vrij, 2008). For example, one study ex-
amining deception in online dating found that hu-
mans perform at-chance detecting deceptive pro-
files because they rely on text-based cues that are
unrelated to deception, such as second-person pro-
nouns (Toma and Hancock, In Press).

Among the automated classifiers, baseline per-
formance is given by the simple genre identifica-
tion approach (POSSVM) proposed in Section 4.1.
Surprisingly, we find that even this simple auto-

16As mentioned in Section 3.3, JUDGE 2 classified fewer than
12% of opinions as deceptive. While achieving 95% truthful re-
call, this judge’s corresponding precision was not significantly
better than chance (two-tailed binomial p = 0.4).

mated classifier outperforms most human judges
(one-tailed sign test p = 0.06, 0.01, 0.001 for the
three judges, respectively, on the first fold). This
result is best explained by theories of reality mon-
itoring (Johnson and Raye, 1981), which suggest
that truthful and deceptive opinions might be clas-
sified into informative and imaginative genres, re-
spectively. Work by Rayson et al. (2001) has found
strong distributional differences between informa-
tive and imaginative writing, namely that the former
typically consists of more nouns, adjectives, prepo-
sitions, determiners, and coordinating conjunctions,
while the latter consists of more verbs,17 adverbs,18

pronouns, and pre-determiners. Indeed, we find that
the weights learned by POSSVM (found in Table 4)
are largely in agreement with these findings, no-
tably except for adjective and adverb superlatives,
the latter of which was found to be an exception by
Rayson et al. (2001). However, that deceptive opin-
ions contain more superlatives is not unexpected,
since deceptive writing (but not necessarily imagi-
native writing in general) often contains exaggerated
language (Buller and Burgoon, 1996; Hancock et al.,
2008).

Both remaining automated approaches to detect-
ing deceptive opinion spam outperform the simple

Table 4: Average feature weights learned by POSSVM. Based on work by Rayson et al. (2001), we expect weights on
the left to be positive (predictive of truthful opinions), and weights on the right to be negative (predictive of deceptive
opinions). Boldface entries are at odds with these expectations. We report average feature weights of unit-normalized
weight vectors, rather than raw weights vectors, to account for potential differences in magnitude between the folds.

genre identification baseline just discussed. Specifi-
cally, the psycholinguistic approach (LIWCSVM) pro-
posed in Section 4.2 performs 3.8% more accurately
(one-tailed sign test p = 0.02), and the standard text
categorization approach proposed in Section 4.3 per-
forms between 14.6% and 16.6% more accurately.
However, best performance overall is achieved by
combining features from these two approaches. Par-
ticularly, the combined model LIWC+BIGRAMS+SVM
is 89.8% accurate at detecting deceptive opinion
spam.19

Surprisingly, models trained only on
UNIGRAMS—the simplest n-gram feature set—
outperform all non–text-categorization approaches,
and models trained on BIGRAMS+ perform even
better (one-tailed sign test p = 0.07). This suggests
that a universal set of keyword-based deception
cues (e.g., LIWC) is not the best approach to de-
tecting deception, and a context-sensitive approach
(e.g., BIGRAMS+) might be necessary to achieve
state-of-the-art deception detection performance.

To better understand the models learned by these
automated approaches, we report in Table 5 the top
15 highest weighted features for each class (truthful
and deceptive) as learned by LIWC+BIGRAMS+SVM
and LIWCSVM. In agreement with theories of reality
monitoring (Johnson and Raye, 1981), we observe
that truthful opinions tend to include more sensorial
and concrete language than deceptive opinions; in

19The result is not significantly better than BIGRAMS+SVM.

particular, truthful opinions are more specific about
spatial configurations (e.g., small, bathroom, on, lo-
cation). This finding is also supported by recent
work by Vrij et al. (2009) suggesting that liars have
considerable difficultly encoding spatial information
into their lies. Accordingly, we observe an increased
focus in deceptive opinions on aspects external to
the hotel being reviewed (e.g., husband, business,

316



vacation).
We also acknowledge several findings that, on the

surface, are in contrast to previous psycholinguistic
studies of deception (Hancock et al., 2008; Newman
et al., 2003). For instance, while deception is often
associated with negative emotion terms, our decep-
tive reviews have more positive and fewer negative
emotion terms. This pattern makes sense when one
considers the goal of our deceivers, namely to create
a positive review (Buller and Burgoon, 1996).

Deception has also previously been associated
with decreased usage of first person singular, an ef-
fect attributed to psychological distancing (Newman
et al., 2003). In contrast, we find increased first
person singular to be among the largest indicators
of deception, which we speculate is due to our de-
ceivers attempting to enhance the credibility of their
reviews by emphasizing their own presence in the
review. Additional work is required, but these find-
ings further suggest the importance of moving be-
yond a universal set of deceptive language features
(e.g., LIWC) by considering both the contextual (e.g.,
BIGRAMS+) and motivational parameters underly-
ing a deception as well.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this work we have developed the first large-scale
dataset containing gold-standard deceptive opinion
spam. With it, we have shown that the detection
of deceptive opinion spam is well beyond the ca-
pabilities of human judges, most of whom perform
roughly at-chance. Accordingly, we have introduced
three automated approaches to deceptive opinion
spam detection, based on insights coming from re-
search in computational linguistics and psychology.
We find that while standard n-gram–based text cate-
gorization is the best individual detection approach,
a combination approach using psycholinguistically-
motivated features and n-gram features can perform
slightly better.

Finally, we have made several theoretical con-
tributions. Specifically, our findings suggest the
importance of considering both the context (e.g.,
BIGRAMS+) and motivations underlying a decep-
tion, rather than strictly adhering to a universal set
of deception cues (e.g., LIWC). We have also pre-
sented results based on the feature weights learned

by our classifiers that illustrate the difficulties faced
by liars in encoding spatial information. Lastly, we
have discovered a plausible relationship between de-
ceptive opinion spam and imaginative writing, based
on POS distributional similarities.

Possible directions for future work include an ex-
tended evaluation of the methods proposed in this
work to both negative opinions, as well as opinions
coming from other domains. Many additional ap-
proaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam are
also possible, and a focus on approaches with high
deceptive precision might be useful for production
environments.
