Abstract

Discourse relations can be categorized as
continuous or discontinuous in the hypoth-
esis of continuity (Murray, 1997), with
continuous relations expressing normal
succession of events in discourse such as
temporal, spatial or causal. Asr and Dem-
berg (2013) propose a markedness mea-
sure to test the prediction that discontin-
uous relations may have more unambigu-
ous connectives, but restrict the marked-
ness calculation to relations with explicit
connectives only. This paper extends their
measure to explicit and implicit relations
and shows that results from this extension
better fit the continuity hypothesis predic-
tions both for the English Penn Discourse
(Prasad et al., 2008) and the Chinese Dis-
course (Zhou and Xue, 2015) Treebanks.

1 Introduction

Discourse relations between units of text are cru-
cial for the production and understanding of dis-
course. Different taxonomies of discourse rela-
tions have been proposed (i.a. Hobbs (1985), Las-
carides and Asher (1993) and Knott and Sanders
(1998)). One taxonomy is based on deictic conti-
nuity (Segal et al., 1991; Murray, 1997): continu-
ity in the sense of Segal et al. (1991) means that
the same frame of reference is maintained, for ex-
ample by subsequent sentences talking about the
same event, without a shift in perspective (Asr and
Demberg, 2012). For instance, a causal relation
such as I was tired, so I drank a cup of coffee. is
continuous, and adversatives show discontinuous
relations: I drank a cup of coffee but I was still
tired. Other continuous relations include temporal
succession, topic succession and so on. The conti-
nuity hypothesis predicts that sentences connected
by continuous relations are easier to understand
than ones connected by discontinuous relations.

Previous work on continuity hypothesis (Maury
and Teisserenc, 2005; Cain and Nash, 2011;
Hoek and Zufferey, 2015) suggests that discourse
connectives are indicators of the continuity of
discourse and help the interlocutors predict the
level of continuity of upcoming sentences. Se-
gal et al. (1991) propose that connectives which
signal discontinuous discourse relations, such as
but, are the marked ones because they indicate
harder-to-comprehend content. Asr and Demberg
(2012, 2013) extend this idea to discourse rela-
tions, proposing that discourse relations which are
discontinuous, or posing a conceptual difficulty
(Haspelmath, 2006), may be less explicitly con-
veyed in text, or more explicitly marked by a con-
nective which unambiguously conveys that spe-
cific relation than continuous ones. They propose
a new measure called markedness to capture this,
but when computed on the Penn Discourse Tree-
bank, results do not fit the continuity theory well.
This paper improves on Asr and Demberg (2013)’s
measure and shows that the results on the Penn
Discourse and the Chinese Discourse Treebanks
fit the continuity hypothesis very well.

2 Discourse Treebanks

Penn Discourse Treebank The Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB) is a corpus of Wall Street Jour-
nal articles annotated with discourse relations
(Prasad et al., 2008). The discourse relations are
organized in a hierarchical structure with three lev-
els: a level 1 (e.g. TEMPORAL), level 1/level 2 (e.g.
TEMPORAL.Asynchronous) or level 1/level 2/level
3 (e.g. TEMPORAL.Asynchronous.succession) re-
lation can appear between two clauses within a
sentence. Discourse relations with overt discourse
connectives are annotated as “Explicit”, whereas
the relations with no discourse connective are an-
notated as “Implicit”. The “AltLex” category is
used when a non-connective expression conveys
the relation. Table 1 gives the distribution of the

1114



relation categories in the corpus.
Some connectives are labeled with multiple re-

lations when it was difficult to pinpoint exactly
one exact discourse relation for it. We follow Asr
and Demberg (2013) and treat these cases as if
there are multiple instances of the connective, each
with one of the labels it received. This gives us a
total of 35,870 relation instances.

Table 1: Relation category counts for the Penn
Discourse and Chinese Discourse Treebanks.

Chinese Discourse Treebank The Chinese Dis-
course Treebank (CDTB, Zhou and Xue 2014) fol-
lows the PDTB annotation style and has annota-
tions for 164 documents from Xinhua News. The
main difference between CDTB and PDTB is that
CDTB has a flat structure of only ten relations
compared to the hierarchical relation structure in
PDTB. Table 1 gives the distribution of the rela-
tion categories.

3 Rethinking the Markedness Measure

To quantify the conceptual difficulty of dis-
course relations, Asr and Demberg (2013) propose
an information-theoretic measure “markedness”,
which tells us how tightly and uniquely a relation
is associated with a connective. The measure uses
normalized point-wise mutual information:

npmi(r; c) =
log p(r)p(c)
log p(r, c)

− 1 (1)

to get the markedness of a discourse relation:

markedness(r) =
∑

c

p(c|r)npmi(r; c) + 1
2

(2)

where r is a relation and c is a discourse connec-
tive. Asr and Demberg (2013) propose this mea-
sure in the surprisal framework of Levy (2008),
and restrict the scope of the data to only Explicit
relations in PDTB. We will call this measure with
only explicit relations “M-exp”. Since surprisal is
defined as the probability of a word given previous

words and context (3), this restriction on the scope
of relations does not seem reasonable. Surprisal is
defined as

surprisal ∝ − log p(wi|w1...i−1, CONTEXT )
(3)

It can be argued that at the current word wi−1,
the distribution of upcoming discourse relations,
available in CONTEXT, should play a role in de-
termining the probability of the upcoming word
wi. In the surprisal model, the domain for wi
should be the same as wi−1, which is all possible
words. However, if we only calculate the distri-
bution of explicit connectives as proposed by Asr
and Demberg (2013), the candidates for wi will
change according to the prediction of whether an
explicit relation is coming up or not. If the upcom-
ing relation is an implicit relation, one then has ac-
cess to a distribution of words without the connec-
tives, whereas if one predicts an explicit relation,
then one predicts the next word using a distribu-
tion of all the connectives as in M-exp. However
surprisal should not be a model of deterministic
decision making. It is more likely the case that
given CONTEXT, one assigns probabilities to all
words given the preceding context, which includes
the case where no connective, in other words a
zero or null connective, is predicted. The null
connective may also be viewed as the probability
mass for all the non-connective words predicted
by CONTEXT where the connective is predicted
to be omitted (Asr and Demberg, 2015).

The markedness measure can be analyzed in
terms of point-wise mutual information (pmi), in-
dicating the amount of information one relation
has for the distribution of the words that follow
it (Hume, 2011). Because pmi is proportionate to
npmi, we can rewrite (2) as

markedness(r) ∝
∑

c

p(c|r)pmi(r; c) (4)

We also have the mutual information measure:

I(X; Y ) =
∑

y

∑
x

p(x, y)pmi(x; y) (5)

For the mutual information of yi in Y :

I(X; Y = yi) =
∑

x p(x, yi)pmi(x; yi)
p(yi)

= DKL(p(x|yi) ‖ p(x))
=

∑
x

p(x|yi)pmi(x; yi)

∝ markedness(yi)

EXPANSION Instantiation Continuous
Restatement Continuous

Exception Discontinuous

Table 2: Continuity of relations according to the continuity hypothesis (Asr and Demberg, 2012).

Therefore, the markedness measure can be under-
stood as the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the
univariate distribution of X from the conditional
distribution of X given yi (a discourse relation in
our case). This shows the influence a relation has
on the unigram distribution of words. Discourse
relations strongly associated with certain connec-
tives will have larger values of this measure than
the ones with a weak association. In the previ-
ous discussion of surprisal, we have seen that one
may treat the implicit cases as predicting a null
connective, which will then expand the domain of
X from explicit cases to all implicit and explicit
cases. With this setup, we calculate “M-all” using
all explicit and implicit relations, with a null con-
nective accompanying all the implicit relations.

Continuity hypothesis has been linked with cog-
nitive difficulties in discourse processing in previ-
ous studies (Segal et al., 1991; Murray, 1997). The
markedness measure can also be linked to process-
ing difficulties through surprisal theory. Surprisal
theory proposes that processing difficulty during
sentence processing can be seen as the work in-
curred by resource allocation during parallel dis-
ambiguation (Levy, 2008). If a relation has a high
markedness value, it indicates that this relation has
a strong influence on the distribution of upcoming
candidate words. The stronger the influence is, the
higher the resource allocation cost will be for the
relation, thus more difficult to process.

ous (see Table 2 which gives the classification
of discourse relations according to the continu-
ity hypothesis). It should therefore have a high
markedness value. However, M-exp assigns a low
markedness to TEMPORAL, which Asr and Dem-
berg (2013) note is unexpected. They ascribe
this to the fact that temporal discourse connec-
tives are often used to mark CONTINGENCY rela-
tions. However because of the high counts of Ex-
plicit connectives in TEMPORAL, whenever there
is a connective that can indicate CONTINGENCY
or TEMPORAL, one is more likely to predict TEM-
PORAL because of fewer null connective cases for
TEMPORAL. In surprisal terms, whenever one pre-
dicts that there is a TEMPORAL relation next, one
will more likely predict that there is an explicit dis-
course connective signaling the relation.

EXPANSION is the least marked of all the rela-
tions in Figure 1 with M-all. An analysis of the
level 2 relations explains this fact. Figure 2 com-

Figure 2: Comparison of markedness measures for PDTB level 2 relations.

pares both measures for the level 2 relations.1 Us-
ing M-all, it is easy to see that discontinuous re-
lations and ambiguous relations are more marked
than the continuous ones. In the case of EXPAN-
SION, the level 2 continuous relations are among
the least marked ones, which are keeping the over-
all markedness low. Also, the ones which are dis-
continuous, especially Exception, are rare, so their
influence to the overall score for EXPANSION is
small. The most frequent relation, Conjunction,
can be viewed as sometimes continuous and some-
times discontinuous, therefore the overall marked-
ness rating for it is in the middle. All these fac-
tors contribute to the lowest markedness for EX-
PANSION. For CONTINGENCY, Condition is not
classified as continuous or discontinuous, and it is
highly marked, thus driving the overall score high.
However if Condition is removed, then CONTIN-
GENCY will be the least marked relation at the
level 1.

At the level 3, there are two discontinuous rela-
tions of interest: precedence (e.g. I had a cup of
coffee before I took a bath) and succession (e.g.
I took a bath after I had a cup of coffee) under
the TEMPORAL.Asynchronous relation. Table 3
compares the markedness measures for both rela-
tions. Asr and Demberg (2013) mention that there
is no significant markedness distinction for them
and we can see that precedence is slightly more
marked than succession in M-exp, but the differ-

1Pragmatic relations are not shown due to their small
number of occurrences.

ence is small. M-all however shows that succes-
sion is more marked than precedence, reflecting
the fact that precedence is easier to understand.

For precedence, the arguments can be in a nor-
mal temporal order, i.e. a forward temporal or-
der (Arg1-Conn-Arg2, e.g. I had some coffee be-
fore I went out.) or in a backward temporal order
(Conn-Arg2-Arg1, e.g. Before I went out, I had
some coffee.). For succession, the temporal or-
der and the argument order are reversed. Table 4
gives the counts in PTDB for both precedence and
succession with different argument orders, show-
ing that Arg1-Conn-Arg2 is the most frequent con-
struction for both relations, which is forward tem-
poral order for precedence and backward tempo-
ral order for succession, despite the fact that both
of the relations can follow a forward temporal or-
der. Therefore the results from M-all match the
continuity hypothesis prediction that events in for-

1117



ward temporal order are easier to understand, thus
less marked, than events in backward temporal or-
der. Asr and Demberg (2012) explain that the rel-
atively high count of Conn-Arg2-Arg1 construc-
tions in succession is due to the fact that this con-
struction actually places the events in the forward
temporal order. We also notice that precedence has
a lot more implicit occurrences than succession,
meaning that inferring a normal temporal relation
is much easier than inferring a reversed temporal
relation.

M-all

Figure 3: Markedness comparison for CDTB.

The results for CDTB, in Figure 3, shows the
same trends as for English: overall, the marked-
ness computed by M-all better fits the continuity
hypothesis. EXPANSION is considered by M-exp
as the second highest marked relation, whereas
the continuity hypothesis predicts it to be one of
the lowest marked relation, which is correctly cap-
tured by M-all. The reason for it to be low may be
that discontinuous relations included by EXPAN-
SION are rare so the frequent continuous relations
dominate, just as for English. Using M-exp, CAU-
SATION is around the middle, but M-all correctly
lowers it to the third least marked relation. TEM-
PORAL is now the second highest marked relation
among all relations, as opposed to the second least
marked one. Importantly, M-all correctly shows
that discourses relations in English and Chinese
behave similarly in terms of markedness, which
indicates that the continuity hypothesis is valid
across languages.

Sanders (2005) proposes the causality-by-
default hypothesis, claiming that CAUSATION is

the default discourse relation when processing dis-
course. However, looking at M-all scores for
both languages, it is clear that CAUSATION is not
the least marked relation in either language. In
fact, EXPANSION can actually be seen as the least
marked common relation in both languages, which
may indicate that EXPANSION is the default dis-
course relation cross-linguistically, yet more in-
vestigations are needed to decide which one in
EXPANSION is the default. CONJUNCTION is also
among the least marked relations in Chinese, with
89% of its instances being implicit, but in English,
CONJUNCTION has an average markedness score.
This shows that there are also differences among
languages on judgments of continuity of specific
relations.

6 Conclusion

The continuity hypothesis predicts that discontinu-
ous discourse relations are less expected than con-
tinuous relations and should be more marked. We
expand Asr and Demberg (2013)’s measure from
explicit relations only to explicit and implicit re-
lations. We show that the results from that expan-
sion fit the predictions of the theory very well, and
such evidence demonstrates that discontinuous re-
lations are indeed cognitively more difficult to pro-
cess. Further we show that such difficulty is con-
sistent across languages, indicating that discourse
relations may not be influenced by idiosyncrasies
of specific languages. Apart from the markedness
measure, Asr and Demberg (2012) proposed an
“implicitness” measure, modeling the continuity
of a relation using the ratio of implicit cases to all
cases. Incorporating explicit and implicit relations
into the markedness measure has the advantage of
not only providing a single measure but also one
which better fits the continuity hypothesis and sur-
prisal theory.
