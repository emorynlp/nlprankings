Abstract

Constructing an organized dataset comprised
of a large number of images and several cap-
tions for each image is a laborious task, which
requires vast human effort. On the other
hand, collecting a large number of images and
sentences separately may be immensely eas-
ier. In this paper, we develop a novel data-
efficient semi-supervised framework for train-
ing an image captioning model. We leverage
massive unpaired image and caption data by
learning to associate them. To this end, our
proposed semi-supervised learning method as-
signs pseudo-labels to unpaired samples via
Generative Adversarial Networks to learn the
joint distribution of image and caption. To
evaluate, we construct scarcely-paired COCO
dataset, a modified version of MS COCO cap-
tion dataset. The empirical results show the ef-
fectiveness of our method compared to several
strong baselines, especially when the amount
of the paired samples are scarce.

1 Introduction

Image captioning is a task of automatically gener-
ating a natural language description of a given im-
age. It is a highly useful task, in that 1) it extracts
the essence from an image into a self-descriptive
form of representation, and 2) the output format
is a natural language, which exhibits free-form
and manageable characteristics useful to applica-
tions such as language based image or region re-
trieval [Johnson et al., 2016; Karpathy and Fei-
Fei, 2015; Kim et al., 2019], video summariza-
tion [Choi et al., 2018], navigation [Wang et al.,
2018a], vehicle control [Kim et al., 2018b]. Im-
age captioning exhibits free-form characteristics,
since it is not confined to a few number of pre-
defined classes. This enables descriptive analysis
of a given image.

Recent research on image captioning has made
impressive progress [Anderson et al., 2018;
Vinyals et al., 2015]. Despite this progress, the

datasets as Dxu and Dyu respectively.

majority of works are trained via supervised learn-
ing that requires a large corpus of caption labeled
images such as the MS COCO caption dataset [Lin
et al., 2014]. Specifically, the dataset is con-
structed with 1.2M images that were asked the
annotators to provide five grammatically plausi-
ble sentences for each image. Constructing such
human-labeled datasets are an immensely labori-
ous task and time-consuming. This is a challenge
of image captioning, because the task heavily re-
quires large data, i.e., data hungry task.

In this work, we present a novel way of leverag-
ing unpaired image and caption data to train data
hungry image captioning neural networks. We
consider a scenario in which we have a small scale
paired image-caption data of a specific domain.
We are motivated by the fact that images can be
easily obtained from the web and captions can be
easily augmented and synthesized by replacing or
adding different words for given sentences as done
in [Zhang et al., 2015]. Moreover, given a suf-
ficient amount of descriptive captions, it is easy
to crawl corresponding but noisy images through
Google or Flickr image databases [Thomee et al.,
2016] to build an image corpus. In this way, we
can easily construct a scalable unpaired dataset of
images and captions, which requires no (or at least
minimal) human effort.

Due to the unpaired nature of images (input)
and captions (output supervision), the conven-



2013

tional supervision loss can no longer be used di-
rectly. We propose to algorithmically assign su-
pervision labels, termed as pseudo-labels, to make
unpaired data paired. The pseudo-label is used
as a learned supervision label. To develop the
mechanism of pseudo-labeling, we use generative
adversarial network (GAN) [Goodfellow et al.,
2014], for searching pseudo-labels for unpaired
data. That is, in order to find the appropriate
pseudo-labels for unpaired samples, we utilize an
adversarial training method for training a discrim-
inator model. Thereby, the discriminator learns to
distinguish between real and fake image-caption
pairs and to retrieve pseudo labels as well as to
enrich the captioner training.

Our main contributions are summarized as fol-
lows. (1) We propose a novel framework for train-
ing an image captioner with the unpaired image-
caption data and a small amount of paired data.
(2) In order to facilitate training with unpaired
data, we devise a new semi-supervised learning
approach by the novel usage of the GAN dis-
criminator. (3) We construct our scarcely-paired
COCO dataset, which is the modified version of
the MS COCO dataset without pairing informa-
tion. On this dataset, we show the effectiveness
of our method in various challenging setups, com-
pared to strong competing methods.

2 Related Work

The goal of our work is to deal with unpaired
image-caption data for image captioning. There-
fore, we mainly focus on image captioning and
unpaired data handling literature.
Data Issues in Image Captioning. Since the
introduction of large-scale datasets such as MS
COCO data [Lin et al., 2014], image captioning
has been extensively studied in vision and lan-
guage society [Anderson et al., 2018; Rennie et
al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015] by
virtue of the advancement of deep convolutional
neural networks [Krizhevsky et al., 2012]. As neu-
ral network architectures become more advanced,
they require much larger dataset scale for gener-
alization [Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014].
Despite the extensive study on better network ar-
chitectures, the data issues for image captioning,
such as noisy data, partially missing data, and un-
paired data have been relatively barely studied.

Unpaired image-caption data has been just re-
cently discussed. Gu et al. [2018] introduce

a third modal information, Chinese captions, for
language pivoting [Utiyama and Isahara, 2007;
Wu and Wang, 2007]. Feng et al. [2019] propose
an unpaired captioning framework which trains a
model without image or sentence labels via learn-
ing a visual concept detector with external data,
OpenImage dataset [Krasin et al., 2017]. Chen et
al. [2017] approach image captioning as a domain
adaptation by utilizing large paired MS COCO
data as the source domain and adapting on a sep-
arate unpaired image or caption dataset as the tar-
get domain. Liu et al. [2018] use self-retrieval for
captioning to facilitate training a model with par-
tially labeled data, where the self-retrieval mod-
ule tries to retrieve corresponding images based
on the generated captions. As a separate line
of work, there are novel object captioning meth-
ods [Anne Hendricks et al., 2016; Venugopalan et
al., 2017] that additionally exploit unpaired image
and caption data corresponding to a novel word.

Most of aforementioned works [Gu et al., 2018;
Anne Hendricks et al., 2016; Venugopalan et al.,
2017; Feng et al., 2019] exploit large auxiliary
supervised data which is often beyond image-
caption data. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to study how to handle unpaired im-
age and caption data for image captioning without
any auxiliary information but by leveraging scarce
paired image-caption data only. Although [Chen
et al., 2017] does not use auxiliary information
as well, it requires large amounts of paired source
data, of which data regime is different from ours.
[Liu et al., 2018] is also this case, where they use
the full paired MS COCO caption dataset with an
additional large unlabeled image set. Our method
lies on a very scarce paired source data regime, of
which scale is only 1% of the COCO dataset.

Multi-modality in Unpaired Data Handling. By
virtue of the advancement on generative modeling
techniques, e.g., GAN [Goodfellow et al., 2014],
multi-modal translation recently emerged as a
popular field. Among many possible modalities,
image-to-image translation between two different
(and unpaired) domains has been mostly explored.
To tackle this issue, the cycle-consistency con-
straint between unpaired data is exploited in Cy-
cleGAN [Zhu et al., 2017] and DiscoGAN [Kim et
al., 2017], and it is further improved in UNIT [Liu
et al., 2017].

In this work, we regard image captioning as
a multi-modal translation. Our work has similar



2014

motivation to the unpaired image-to-image trans-
lation [Zhu et al., 2017], and unsupervised ma-
chine translation [Artetxe et al., 2018; Lample et
al., 2018a,b] works or machine translation with
monolingual data [Zhang et al., 2018]. However,
we show that the cycle-consistency does not work
on our problem setup due to a significant modal-
ity gap. Instead, our results suggest that the tra-
ditional label propagation based semi-supervised
framework [Zhou et al., 2004] is more effective
for our task.
Semi-supervised Learning. Our method is mo-
tivated by the generative model based semi-
supervised learning [Chongxuan et al., 2017; Gan
et al., 2017; Kingma et al., 2014], which mostly
deals with classification labels. In contrast, we
leverage caption data and devise a novel model to
train the captioning model.

3 Proposed Framework

In this section, we first brief the standard image
caption learning, and describe how we can lever-
age the unpaired dataset. Then, we introduce an
adversarial learning method for obtaining a GAN
model that is used for assigning pseudo-labels and
encouraging to match the distribution of latent fea-
tures of images and captions. Lastly, we describe
a connection to CycleGAN.

3.1 Model
Let us denote a dataset with Np image-caption
pairs as Dp = {(xi, yi)}

Np
i=1. A typical image cap-

tioning task is defined as follows: given an im-
age xi, we want a model to generate a caption yi
that best describe the image. Traditionally, a cap-
tioning model is trained on a large paired dataset
(x, y) ∈ Dp, e.g., MS COCO dataset, by minimiz-
ing the negative log likelihood against the ground
truth caption as follows:

min
θ

∑
(x,y)∈Dp

LCE(y,x; θ), (1)

where LCE = −log qθ(y|x) denotes the cross en-
tropy loss, θ the set of learnable parameters, and
q(·) the probability output of the model. Moti-
vated by encoder-decoder based neural machine
translation literature [Cho et al., 2014], tradi-
tional captioning frameworks are typically imple-
mented as a encoder-decoder architecture [Vinyals
et al., 2015], i.e., CNN-RNN. The CNN encoder
F (x; θenc) produces a latent feature vector zx

from a given input image x, and the RNN decoder
H(zx; θdec) is followed to generate a caption y in
a natural language form from zx, as depicted in
Fig. 2. The term q(·) in Eq. (1) is typically im-
plemented by the sum of the cross entropy of each
word token. For simplicity, we omit θ from here if
deducible, e.g., H(zx).

Learning with Unpaired Data. Our problem
deals with unpaired data samples, where the image
and caption sets Dxu={xi}

Nx
i=0 and D

y
u={yi}

Ny
i=0

are not paired. Given the unpaired datasets, due to
the missing supervision, the loss in Eq. (1) cannot
be directly computed. Motivated by the nearest
neighbor aware semi-supervised framework [Shi
et al., 2018], we artificially generate pseudo-labels
for respective unpaired datasets.

Specifically, we retrieve a best match caption
ỹi in Dyu given a query image xi, and assign it
as a pseudo-label, and vice versa (x̃i for yi). We
abuse the pseudo-label as a function for simplic-
ity, e.g., ỹi = ỹ(xi). To retrieve a semantically
meaningful match, we need a measure to assess
matches. We use a discriminator network to de-
termine real or fake pairs by GAN, which we will
describe later. With the retrieved pseudo-labels,
now we can compute Eq. (1) by modifying it as:

min
θ
λx

∑
x∈Dxu

LCE(ỹ(x),x; θ) + λy
∑
y∈Dyu

LCE(y, x̃(y); θ),

(2)

where λ{·} denote the balance parameters.

Discriminator Learning by Unpaired Feature
Matching. We train the criterion to find a se-
mantically meaningful match, so that pseudo-
labels for each modality are effectively retrieved.
We learn a discriminator for that by using a small
amount of paired supervised dataset.

We adopt a caption encoder, G(y; θcap), which
embeds the caption y into a feature zy. This is im-
plemented with a single layer LSTM, and we take
the output of the last time step as the caption rep-
resentation zy. Likewise, given an image x, we
obtain zx by the image encoder F (x; θenc). Now,
we have a comparable feature space of zx and zy.
We utilize the discriminator to distinguish whether
the pair (zx, zy) from true paired data (x, y) ∈ Dp,
i.e., the pair belongs to the real distribution p(x, y)
or not. We could use random pairs of (x, y)
independently sampled from respective unpaired
datasets, but we found that it is detrimental due
to uninformative pairs. Instead, we conditionally

Given any image and caption pair, CNN and RNN (LSTM) encoders encode input image and caption into the
respective feature spaces. A discriminator (D) is trained to discriminate whether the given feature pairs are real or
fake, while the encoders are trained to fool the discriminator. The learned discriminator is also used to assign the
most likely pseudo-labels to unpaired samples through the pseudo-label search module.

synthesize zx or zy, to form a synthesized pair that
appears to be as realistic as possible. We use the
feature transformer networks z̃y =Tv→c(zx) and
z̃x=Tc→v(z

y), where v→c denotes the mapping
from visual data to caption data and vice versa, and
z̃ denotes the conditionally synthesized feature.
{T} are implemented with multi-layer-perceptron
with four FC layers with ReLU nonlinearity.

The discriminator D(·, ·) learns to distinguish
features, real or not. At the same time, the other
associated networks F , G, T{·} are learned to fool
the discriminator by matching the distribution of
paired and unpaired data. Motivated by [Chongx-
uan et al., 2017], the formulation of this adversar-
ial training is as follows:
min

,

(3)
where Lreg(zx, zy, {T})=

λreg(‖ T

(zx)−zy‖2F + ‖zx− T

and we use the distribution notation p(·) to flex-
ibly refer to any type of the dataset regardless
of Dp and Du. Note that the first log term is
not used for updating any learnable parameters
related to θ, {T}, but only used for updating D.
Through alternating training of the discriminator

(D) and generator (θ, {T}) similar to [Kim et
al., 2018a], the latent feature distribution of
paired and unpaired data should be close to
each other, i.e., p(zx, zy) = p(zx, Tv→c(zx)) =
p(Tc→v(z

y), zy) (refer to the proof in [Chongxuan
et al., 2017]). In addition, as the generator is
trained, the decision boundary of the discriminator
tightens. If the unpaired datasets are sufficiently
large such that semantically meaningful matches
exist between the different modality datasets, and
if the discriminator D is plausibly learned, we
can use D to retrieve a proper pseudo-label. Our
architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Pseudo-label Assignment. Given an image x ∈
Dxu, we retrieve a caption in the unpaired dataset,
i.e., ỹ ∈ Dyu, that has the highest score obtained by
the discriminator, i.e., the most likely caption to be
paired with the given image as

ỹi = ỹ(xi) = argmax
y∈Dyu

D (F (xi), G(y)) , (4)

vice versa for unpaired captions:

x̃i = x̃(yi) = argmax
x∈Dxu

D (F (x), G(yi)) . (5)

By this retrieval process over all the unpaired
dataset, we have image-caption pairs {(xi, yi)}
from the paired data and the pairs with pseudo-
labels {(xj , ỹj)} and {(x̃k, yk)} from the unpaired



2016

data. However, these pseudo-labels are not noise-
free, thus treating them equally with the paired
ones is detrimental. Motivated by learning with
noisy labels [Lee et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b],
we define a confidence score for each of the as-
signed pseudo-labels. We use the output score
from the discriminator, as the confidence score,
i.e., αxi=D̂(xi, ỹi) and α

y
i=D̂(x̃i, yi), where we

denote D̂(x, y)=D(F (x), G(y)), and α ∈ [0, 1]
due to the sigmoid function of the final layer of the
discriminator. Therefore, we utilize the confidence
scores to assign weights to the unpaired samples.
We compute the weighted loss as follows:

min
θ

∑
(x,y)∈Dp

LCE(y,x; θ) + λx
∑

x∈Dxu
αxi LCE(ỹ(x),x; θ)

+λy
∑
y∈Dyu

αyiLCE(y, x̃(y); θ). (6)

We jointly train the model on both paired and
unpaired data. To ease the training further, we add
an additional triplet loss function:∑

(xp,yp)∈Dp,
xu∈Dxu,yu∈D

y
u

log
pθ(yp|xp)
pθ(yp|xu)

+log
pθ(yp|xp)
pθ(yu|xp)

, (7)

by regarding random unpaired samples as nega-
tive. This slightly improves the performance.

3.2 Connection with CycleGAN
As a representative fully unpaired method, Cy-
cleGAN [Zhu et al., 2017] would be the strong
baseline at this point, which has been popularly
used for unpaired distribution matching. Since
it is designed for image-to-image translation, we
describe the modifications to it to fit our task,
so as to understand relative performance of our
method over the CycleGAN baseline. When ap-
plying the cycle-consistency on matching between
images and captions, since the input modalities are
totally different, we modify it to a translation prob-
lem over feature spaces as follows:

min
θ,{T}

max
D{x,y}

Lcycle({T})

+ E
x∼p(x)

[log(Dx(F (x))) + log(1−Dx(Tv→c(F (x))))]

+ E
y∼p(y)

[log(Dy(G(y))) + log(1−Dy(Tc→v(G(y))))],

(8)

where {T} and D{x,y} denotes the feature transla-
tors and the discriminators for image domain and
caption domain, and

Lcycle({T}) = Ex∼p(x)[‖Tc→v(Tv→c(F (x)))− F (x)‖2]
+Ey∼p(y)[‖Tv→c(Tc→v(G(y)))−G(y)‖2].

(9)

The discriminator D is learned to distinguish
whether the latent features is from the image or
the caption distribution. This is different with our
method, in that we distinguish the correct seman-
tic match of pairs. We experimented with Cycle-
GAN purely on unpaired datasets, but we were not
able to train it; hence, we add the supervised loss
(Eq. (1)) with the paired data, which is a fair set-
ting with ours.

4 Experiments

In this section, we describe the experimental
setups, competing methods and provide perfor-
mance evaluations of unpaired captioning with
both quantitative and qualitative results.

4.1 Implementation Details

We implement our neural networks by PyTorch li-
brary [Paszke et al., 2017]. We use ResNet101 [He
et al., 2016] model as a backbone CNN encoder
for image input, and initialize with weights pre-
trained on ImageNet [Russakovsky et al., 2015].
Each region is represented as 2,048-dimensional
output from the last residual block of this network.
For NIC model [Vinyals et al., 2015] and Att2in
model [Rennie et al., 2017] in Table 3, we use vi-
sual features with size 2048 × 7 × 7 . For Up-
Down [Anderson et al., 2018] and the model in Ta-
ble 3, we use Faster R-CNN [Ren et al., 2015] pre-
trained on Visual Genome [Krishna et al., 2017]
object dataset, thereby we extract visual features
for 10 to 100 regions.

We set the channel size of the hidden layers of
LSTMs to be 1024, 512 for the attention layer,
and 1024 for the word embeddings. For inference
stage, we empirically choose the beam size to be
3 when generating a description, which shows the
best performance.

We use a minibatch size of 100, the Adam [Ba
and Kingma, 2015] optimizer for training (learn-
ing rate lr=5e−4, b1=0.9, b2=0.999). For hyper-
parameters, we empirically choose λx and λy to
be equal to 0.1. The total loss function for training
our model is as follows:

L = Lcap + 0.1LGAN + 0.1Ltriplet, (10)

where Lcap denotes the captioning loss defined in
Eq. (6), LGAN the loss for adversarial training de-
fined in Eq. (3), and Ltriplet the triplet loss defined
in Eq. (7).

COCO dataset, while CycleGAN and Ours {ver1, ver2,
final}, are trained with our scarcely-paired COCO
dataset (1% of paired data and unpaired image and cap-
tion datasets). We indicate the ablation study by: (A)
the usage of the proposed GAN that distinguishes real
or fake image-caption pairs, (B) pseudo-labeling, and
(C) noise handling by sample re-weighting. We also
compare with [Gu et al., 2018] and [Feng et al., 2019],
which are trained with unpaired datasets.

4.2 Experimental Setups

We utilize MS COCO caption [Lin et al., 2014]
as our target dataset, which contains 123k images
with 5 caption labels per image. To validate our
model, we follow Karpathy splits [Karpathy and
Fei-Fei, 2015], which have been broadly used in
image captioning literature. The Karpathy splits
contain 113k training, 5k validation, and 5k test
images in total. In our experiments, in order to
simulate the scenario that both paired and unpaired
data exist, we use two different data setups: 1) the
proposed scarcely-paired COCO, and 2) partially
labeled COCO [Liu et al., 2018] setup.

For the scarcely-paired COCO setup, we re-
move the pairing information of the MS COCO
dataset, while leaving a small fraction of pairs un-
altered. We randomly select only one percent of
the total data, i.e., 1,133 training images for the
paired data, and remove the pairing information
of the rest to obtain unpaired data. We call the
small fraction of samples given as pairs as paired
data (Dp) and call the samples without pairing in-
formation as unpaired data (Du). We study the
effects of other ratios of paired data used for train-
ing (in Figs. 4 and 3). This dataset allows evalu-
ating the proposed framework to measure whether
such small paired data can be leveraged to learn
plausible pseudo-label assignment, and what per-
formance can be achieved compared to the fully
supervised case.

For partially labeled COCO setup, we follow
[Liu et al., 2018] and use the whole MS COCO
data (paired) and add the “Unlabeled-COCO”

For evaluation, we use the following met-
rics conventionally used in image caption-
ing: BLEU [Papineni et al., 2002], ROUGUE-
L [Lin, 2004], SPICE [Anderson et al., 2016],
METEOR [Denkowski and Lavie, 2014], and
CIDEr [Vedantam et al., 2015]. All the evaluation
is done on MS COCO testset.

In order to avoid high time complexity of
the pseudo-labeling process, we do not search
the pseudo-labels from the whole unpaired data.
Pseudo-label retrieval is done on a subset of one-
hundredth of the unpaired data (yielding 1000
samples). Thus, the complexity of each minibatch
becomes O(B ×N × 0.01), where B denotes the
minibatch size, N denotes the size of the unpaired
dataset. Since we also apply label-noise handling,
a plausible pseudo-label assignment is sufficient
in helping the learning process. We can improve
performance by using a larger subset or by using a
fast approximate nearest neighbor search.

4.3 Evaluation on Scarcely-paired COCO
We follow the same setting with [Vinyals et al.,
2015], if not mentioned. Table 1 shows the re-
sults on the scarcely-paired COCO dataset. We
compare with several baselines: Paired Only; we
train our model only on the small fraction (1%)
of the paired data, CycleGAN; we train our model
with the cycle-consistency loss [Zhu et al., 2017]
(as in Eq. (8)). Additionally, we train variants of
our model denoted as Ours (ver1, ver2, and fi-
nal). The model denoted as Our ver1, is trained

Figure 4: Sampled qualitative results of our model. We compare with the baseline models trained only on N% of
paired samples out of the full MS COCO. Despite the use of only 1% paired data, our model generates plausible
captions similar to that of the baseline models trained with more data (10% and above).

via our GAN model (Eq. (3)) that distinguishes
real or fake image-caption pairs. For Our ver2, we
add training with pseudo-labels for unpaired data
with Eq. (6) while setting the confidence scores
αx=αy=1 for all training samples. For our final
model denoted as Our (final), we apply the noise
handling technique by the confidence scores αx

and αy computed by Eq. (6) and re-weighting the
loss for each sample. We present the performance
of the fully supervised (Fully paired) model using
100% of the COCO training data for reference.

As shown in Table 1, in a scarce data regime,
utilizing the unpaired data improves the captioning
performance in terms of all metrics by noticeable
margins. Also, our models show favorable perfor-
mance compared to the CycleGAN model in all
metrics. Our final model with pseudo-labels and
noise handling achieves the best performance in
all metrics across all the competitor, hereafter ref-
ered to this model as our model.

We also compare the recent unpaired image
captioning methods [Gu et al., 2018; Feng et al.,
2019] in Table 1. Both of the methods are eval-
uated on MS COCO testset. In the case of Gu et
al., AIC-ICC image-to-Chinese dataset [Wu et al.,
2017] is used as unpaired images Dxu and cap-
tions from MS COCO are used as unpaired cap-
tions Dyu. Note that this is not a fair comparison to

our method but they have more advantages, in that
Gu et al. use large amounts of additional labeled
data (10M Chinese-English parallel sentences of
AIC-MT dataset [Wu et al., 2017]) and Feng et
al. use 36M samples of additional OpenImages
dataset, whereas our model only uses a small
amount of paired samples (1k) and 122k unpaired
data. Despite far lower reliance on paired data, our
model shows favorable performance against recent
unpaired captioning works.

We study our final model against our Paired
Only baseline according to varying amounts of
paired training data in Fig. 3, so that we can see
how much information can be gained from the un-
paired data. From 100% to 10%, as the amount of
paired samples decreases, the fluency and the ac-
curacy of the descriptions get worse. In particular,
we observed that most of the captions generated
from the Paired Only baseline trained with 10% of
paired data (11,329 pairs) show erroneous gram-
matical structure. In contrast, by leveraging un-
paired data, our method can generate more fluent
and accurate captions, compared to Paired Only
trained on the same amount of paired data. It is
worthwhile to note that our model trained with
60% of paired data (67,972 pairs) achieves similar
performance to the Paired Only baseline trained
with fully paired data (113,287 pairs), which sig-

Table 2: Comparison with the semi-supervised image captioning method, “Self-Retrieval” [Liu et al., 2018]. Our
method shows improved performance even without Unlabeled-COCO data (denoted as w/o unlabeled) as well as
with Unlabeled-COCO (with unlabeled), although our model is not originally proposed for such scenario.

posed adversarial training.

nifies that our method is able to save near half of
the human labeling effort of constructing a dataset.

We also show qualitative samples of our results
in Fig. 4. Paired Only baseline trained with 1%
paired data produces erroneous captions, and the
baseline with 10% paired data starts to produce
plausible captions. It is based on ten times more
paired samples, compared to our model that uses
only 1% of them. We highlight that, in the two ex-
amples on the top row of Fig. 4, our model gener-
ates more accurate captions than the Paired Only
baseline trained on the 100% paired data (“base-
ball” to “Frisbee” on the top-left, and “man” to
“woman” on the top-right). This suggests that un-
paired data with our method effectively boosts the
performance especially when paired data is scarce.

In order to demonstrate the meaningfulness of
our pseudo-label assignment, we show the pseudo-
labels assigned to the unpaired samples. We show
the pseudo-labels (captions) assigned to unlabeled
images from Unlabeled-COCO images in Fig. 5.
As shown in the figure, despite not knowing the
real pairs of these images, the pseudo labels are
sufficiently assigned by the model. Note that even
though there is no ground truth caption for unla-
beled images in the searching pool, the model is
able to find the most likely (semantically corre-
lated) image-caption pair for the given images.

Fig. 6 highlights interesting result samples of
our caption generation, where the results con-
tain words that do not exist in the paired data of
the scarcely-paired COCO dataset. The semantic
meaning of the words such as “growling,” “grow-

ing,” and “herded,” which involve in the unpaired
caption data but not in the paired data, may have
been learned properly via pseudo-label assignment
during training. These examples suggest that our
method is capable to infer the semantic meaning of
unpaired words to some extent, which would have
been unable to be learned with only little paired
data. This would be an evidence that our frame-
work is capable to align abstract semantic spaces
between two modalities, i.e., visual and caption.

4.4 Evaluation on Partially Labeled COCO

For a more realistic setup, we compare with the
recent semi-supervised image captioning method,
called Self-Retrieval [Liu et al., 2018], on their
problem regime, i.e., “partially labeled” COCO
setup, where the full amount of the paired MS
COCO (113k) plus 123k uncaptioned images of
the Unlabeled-COCO set are used (no additional
unpaired caption is used). While their regime is
not our direct scope, but we show the effectiveness
of our method in the regime. Then, we extend our
framework by replacing our backbone architecture
with recent advanced image caption architectures.
In this setup, a separate unpaired caption data Dyu
does not exist, thus we use captions from paired
COCO data Dp as pseudo-labels.

Table 2 shows the comparison with Self-
Retrieval. For a fair comparison with them,
we replace the cross entropy loss from our loss
with the policy gradient method [Rennie et al.,
2017] to directly optimize our model with CIDEr
score as in [Liu et al., 2018]. As our baseline

model (denoted as Baseline), we train a model
only with policy gradient method without the pro-
posed GAN model. When only using the 100%
paired MS COCO dataset (denoted as w/o unla-
beled), our model already shows improved per-
formance over Self-Retrieval. Moreover, when
adding Unlabeled-COCO images (denoted as with
unlabeled), our model performs favorably against
Self-Retrieval in all the metrics. The results sug-
gest that our method is also advantageous in the
semi-supervised setup.

To further validate our method in the semi-
supervised setup, we compare different backbone
architectures [Anderson et al., 2018; Rennie et
al., 2017; Vinyals et al., 2015] in our frame-
work, where their methods are developed for fully-
supervised methods. We use the same data setup
with the above, but we replace CNN (F ) and
LSTM (H) from our framework with the image
encoder and the caption decoder from their im-
age captioning models. Then, these models can
be trained in our framework as it is by alternat-
ing between the discriminator update and pseudo-
labeling. Table 3 shows the comparison. Training
with the additional Unlabeled-COCO data via our
training scheme consistently improves all base-
lines in all metrics.

4.5 Captioning with Web-Crawled Data
To simulate a scenario involving crawled data
from the web, we use the setup suggested by
Feng et al. [2019]. They collect a sentence cor-
pus by crawling the image descriptions from Shut-
terstock1 as unpaired caption data Dyu, whereby
2.2M sentences are collected. For unpaired im-
age data Dxu, they use only the images from the
MS COCO data, while the captions are not used
for training. For training our method, we lever-
age from 0.5% to 1% of paired MS COCO data
as our paired data Dp. The results are shown in
Table 4 with the performance obtained by Feng et

al. Note again that Feng et al. exploits external
large-scale data, i.e., 36M images in the OpenIm-
ages dataset. With 0.5% of paired only data (566
pairs), our baseline shows lower scores in terms
of BLEU4 and METEOR than Feng et al., while
our proposed model shows comparable or favor-
able performance in BLEU4, ROUGE-L and ME-
TEOR. Our method starts to have higher scores in
all metrics from 0.8% of paired data (906 pairs),
even without additional 36M images.

5 Conclusion

We introduce a method to train an image cap-
tioning model with a large scale unpaired image
and caption data, given a small amount of paired
data. Our framework achieves favorable perfor-
mance compared to various methods and setups.
Unpaired captions and images are the data that can
be easily collected from the web. It can facilitate
application specific captioning models, where la-
beled data is scarce.
