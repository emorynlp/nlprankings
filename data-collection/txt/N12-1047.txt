Abstract

There has been a proliferation of recent work
on SMT tuning algorithms capable of han-
dling larger feature sets than the traditional
MERT approach. We analyze a number of
these algorithms in terms of their sentence-
level loss functions, which motivates several
new approaches, including a Structured SVM.
We perform empirical comparisons of eight
different tuning strategies, including MERT,
in a variety of settings. Among other results,
we find that a simple and efficient batch ver-
sion of MIRA performs at least as well as
training online, and consistently outperforms
other options.

1 Introduction

The availability of linear models and discriminative
tuning algorithms has been a huge boon to statis-
tical machine translation (SMT), allowing the field
to move beyond the constraints of generative noisy
channels (Och and Ney, 2002). The ability to opti-
mize these models according to an error metric has
become a standard assumption in SMT, due to the
wide-spread adoption of Minimum Error Rate Train-
ing or MERT (Och, 2003). However, MERT has
trouble scaling to more than 30 features, which has
led to a surge in research on tuning schemes that can
handle high-dimensional feature spaces.

These methods fall into a number of broad cate-
gories. Minimum risk approaches (Och, 2003; Smith
and Eisner, 2006) have been quietly capable of han-
dling many features for some time, but have yet to
see widespread adoption. Online methods (Liang
et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), are recognized
to be effective, but require substantial implementa-
tion efforts due to difficulties with parallelization.

Pairwise ranking (Shen et al., 2004; Hopkins and
May, 2011) recasts tuning as classification, and can
be very easy to implement, as it fits nicely into the
established MERT infrastructure.

The MERT algorithm optimizes linear weights
relative to a collection of k-best lists or lattices,
which provide an approximation to the true search
space. This optimization is wrapped in an outer
loop that iterates between optimizing weights and
re-decoding with those weights to enhance the ap-
proximation. Our primary contribution is to empiri-
cally compare eight tuning algorithms and variants,
focusing on methods that work within MERT’s es-
tablished outer loop. This is the first comparison to
include all three categories of optimizer.

Furthermore, we introduce three tuners that have
not been previously tested. In particular, we
test variants of Chiang et al.’s (2008) hope-fear
MIRA that use k-best or lattice-approximated search
spaces, producing a Batch MIRA that outperforms
a popular mechanism for parallelizing online learn-
ers. We also investigate the direct optimization of
hinge loss on k-best lists, through the use of a Struc-
tured SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004). We review
and organize the existing tuning literature, provid-
ing sentence-level loss functions for minimum risk,
online and pairwise training. Finally, since random-
ization plays a different role in each tuner, we also
suggest a new method for testing an optimizer’s sta-
bility (Clark et al., 2011), which sub-samples the
tuning set instead of varying a random seed.

2 Background

We begin by establishing some notation. We view
our training set as a list of triples [f,R, E ]ni=1, where
f is a source-language sentence, R is a set of target-
language reference sentences, and E is the set of



all reachable hypotheses; that is, each e ∈ Ei is a
target-language derivation that can be decoded from
fi. The function ~hi(e) describes e’s relationship to
its source fi using features that decompose into the
decoder. A linear model ~w scores derivations ac-
cording to their features, meaning that the decoder
solves:

ei(~w) = arg max
e∈Ei

~w · ~hi(e) (1)

Assuming we wish to optimize our decoder’s BLEU
score (Papineni et al., 2002), the natural objec-
tive of learning would be to find a ~w such that
BLEU([e(~w), R]n1 ) is maximal. In most machine
learning papers, this would be the point where we
would say, “unfortunately, this objective is unfeasi-
ble.” But in SMT, we have been happily optimizing
exactly this objective for years using MERT.

However, it is now acknowledged that the MERT
approach is not feasible for more than 30 or so fea-
tures. This is due to two main factors:

1. MERT’s parameter search slows and becomes
less effective as the number of features rises,
stopping it from finding good training scores.

2. BLEU is a scale invariant objective: one can
scale ~w by any positive constant and receive the
same BLEU score.1 This causes MERT to re-
sist standard mechanisms of regularization that
aim to keep ||~w|| small.

The problems with MERT can be addressed
through the use of surrogate loss functions. In this
paper, we focus on linear losses that decompose over
training examples. Using Ri and Ei, each loss `i(~w)
indicates how poorly ~w performs on the ith training
example. This requires a sentence-level approxima-
tion of BLEU, which we re-encode into a cost ∆i(e)
on derivations, where a high cost indicates that e re-
ceives a low BLEU score. Unless otherwise stated,
we will assume the use of sentence BLEU with add-
1 smoothing (Lin and Och, 2004). The learners dif-
fer in their definition of ` and ∆, and in how they
employ their loss functions to tune their weights.

1This is true of any evaluation metric that considers only the
ranking of hypotheses and not their model scores; ie, it is true
of all common MT metrics.

2.1 Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm
First employed in SMT by Watanabe et al. (2007),
and refined by Chiang et al. (2008; 2009), the Mar-
gin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) employs a
structured hinge loss:

`i(~w) = max
e∈Ei

[
∆i(e) + ~w ·

(
~hi(e)− ~hi(e∗i )

)]
(2)

where e∗i is an oracle derivation, and cost is de-
fined as ∆i(e) = BLEUi(e∗i )− BLEUi(e), so that
∆i(e

∗
i ) = 0. The loss `i(~w) is 0 only if ~w separates

each e ∈ Ei from e∗i by a margin proportional to their
BLEU differentials.

MIRA is an instance of online learning, repeating
the following steps: visit an example i, decode ac-
cording to ~w, and update ~w to reduce `i(~w). Each
update makes the smallest change to ~w (subject to a
step-size cap C) that will separate the oracle from a
number of negative hypotheses. The work of Cram-
mer et al. (2006) shows that updating away from a
single “fear” hypothesis that maximizes (2) admits
a closed-form update that performs well. Let e′i be
the e ∈ Ei that maximizes `i(~w); the update can be
performed in two steps:

ηt = min

[
C, `i(~wt)
||~hi(e∗i )−~hi(e′i)||2

]
~wt+1 = ~wt + ηt

(
~hi(e

∗
i )− ~hi(e′i)

) (3)
To improve generalization, the average of all
weights seen during learning is used on unseen data.

Chiang et al. (2008) take advantage of MIRA’s
online nature to modify each update to better suit
SMT. The cost ∆i is defined using a pseudo-
corpus BLEU that tracks the n-gram statistics of
the model-best derivations from the last few up-
dates. This modified cost matches corpus BLEU
better than add-1 smoothing, but it also makes ∆i
time-dependent: each update for an example i will
be in the context of a different pseudo-corpus. The
oracle e∗i also shifts with each update to ~w, as it
is defined as a “hope” derivation, which maximizes
~w · ~hi(e) + BLEUi(e). Hope updating ensures that
MIRA aims for ambitious, reachable derivations.

In our implementation, we make a number of
small, empirically verified deviations from Chiang
et al. (2008). These include the above-mentioned
use of a single hope and fear hypothesis, and the use



of hope hypotheses (as opposed to model-best hy-
potheses) to build the pseudo-corpus for calculating
BLEUi. These changes were observed to be neu-
tral with respect to translation quality, but resulted in
faster running time and simplified implementation.

2.2 Direct Optimization
With the exception of MIRA, the tuning approaches
discussed in this paper are direct optimizers. That is,
each solves the following optimization problem:

~w∗ = arg min
~w

λ

2
||~w||2 +

∑
i

`i(~w) (4)

where the first term provides regularization,
weighted by λ. Throughout this paper, (4) is
optimized with respect to a fixed approximation
of the decoder’s true search space, represented as
a collection of k-best lists. The various methods
differ in their definition of loss and in how they
optimize their objective.

Without the complications added by hope decod-
ing and a time-dependent cost function, unmodified
MIRA can be shown to be carrying out dual coordi-
nate descent for an SVM training objective (Martins
et al., 2010). However, exactly what objective hope-
fear MIRA is optimizing remains an open question.
Gimpel and Smith (2012) discuss these issues in
greater detail, while also providing an interpretable
alternative to MIRA.

2.3 Pairwise Ranking Optimization
Introduced by Hopkins and May (2011), Pairwise
Ranking Optimization (PRO) aims to handle large
feature sets inside the traditional MERT architec-
ture. That is, PRO employs a growing approxima-
tion of Ei by aggregating the k-best hypotheses from
a series of increasingly refined models. This archi-
tecture is desirable, as most groups have infrastruc-
ture to k-best decode their tuning sets in parallel.

For a given approximate Ẽi, PRO creates a sam-
ple Si of (eg, eb) pairs, such that BLEUi(eg) >
BLEUi(eb). It then uses a binary classifier to sep-
arate each pair. We describe the resulting loss in
terms of an SVM classifier, to highlight similarities
with MIRA. In terms of (4), PRO defines

`i(~w) =
∑

(eg ,eb)∈Si

2
(

1 + ~w ·
(
~hi(eb)− ~hi(eg)

))+

where (x)+ = max(0, x). The hinge loss is multi-
plied by 2 to account for PRO’s use of two examples
(positive and negative) for each sampled pair. This
sum of hinge-losses is 0 only if each pair is separated
by a model score of 1. Given [S]ni=1, this convex
objective can be optimized using any binary SVM.2

Unlike MIRA, the margin here is fixed to 1; cost en-
ters into PRO through its sampling routine, which
performs a large uniform sample and then selects a
subset of pairs with large BLEU differentials.

The PRO loss uses a sum over pairs in place of
MIRA’s max, which allows PRO to bypass oracle
selection, and to optimize with off-the-shelf classi-
fiers. This sum is potentially a weakness, as PRO
receives credit for each correctly ordered pair in its
sample, and these pairs are not equally relevant to
the final BLEU score.

2.4 Minimum Risk Training
Minimum risk training (MR) interprets ~w as a prob-
abilistic model, and optimizes expected BLEU. We
focus on expected sentence costs (Och, 2003; Zens
et al., 2007; Li and Eisner, 2009), as this risk is sim-
ple to optimize and fits nicely into our mathemati-
cal framework. Variants that use the expected suffi-
cient statistics of BLEU also exist (Smith and Eisner,
2006; Pauls et al., 2009; Rosti et al., 2011).

We again assume a MERT-like tuning architec-
ture. Let ∆i(e) = −BLEUi(e) and let

`i(~w) = EP~w [∆i(e)] =

∑
e∈Ẽi

[
exp(~w · ~hi(e))∆i(e)

]
∑

e′∈Ẽi exp(~w ·
~hi(e′))

This expected cost becomes increasingly small as
greater probability mass is placed on derivations
with high BLEU scores. This smooth, non-convex
objective can be solved to a local minimum using
gradient-based optimizers; we have found stochastic
gradient descent to be quite effective (Bottou, 2010).

Like PRO, MR requires no oracle derivation, and
fits nicely into the established MERT architecture.
The expectations needed to calculate the gradient

2Hopkins and May (2011) advocate a maximum-entropy

version of PRO, which is what we evaluate in our empirical
comparison. It can be obtained using a logit loss `i(~w) =∑

.



are trivial to extract from a k-best list of derivations.
Each downward step along this gradient moves the
model toward likely derivations, and away from
likely derivations that incur high costs.

3 Novel Methods

We have reviewed three tuning methods, all of which
address MERT’s weakness with large features by us-
ing surrogate loss functions. Additionally, MIRA
has the following advantages over PRO and MR:

1. Loss is optimized using the true Ei, as opposed
to an approximate search space Ẽi.

2. Sentence BLEU is calculated with a fluid
pseudo-corpus, instead of add-1 smoothing.

Both of these advantages come at a cost: oper-
ating on the true Ei sacrifices easy parallelization,
while using a fluid pseudo-corpus creates an unsta-
ble learning objective. We develop two large-margin
tuners that explore these trade-offs.

3.1 Batch MIRA

Online training makes it possible to learn with the
decoder in the loop, forgoing the need to approxi-
mate the search space, but it is not necessarily con-
venient to do so. Online algorithms are notoriously
difficult to parallelize, as they assume each example
is visited in sequence. Parallelization is important
for efficient SMT tuning, as decoding is still rela-
tively expensive.

The parallel online updates suggested by Chi-
ang et al. (2008) involve substantial inter-process
communication, which may not be easily supported
by all clusters. McDonald et al. (2010) suggest
a simpler distributed strategy that is amenable to
map-reduce-like frameworks, which interleaves on-
line training on shards with weight averaging across
shards. This strategy has been adopted by Moses
(Hasler et al., 2011), and it is the one we adopt in
our MIRA implementation.

However, online training using the decoder may
not be necessary for good performance. The success
of MERT, PRO and MR indicates that their shared
search approximation is actually quite reasonable.
Therefore, we propose Batch MIRA, which sits ex-
actly where MERT sits in the standard tuning archi-
tecture, greatly simplifying parallelization:

1. Parallel Decode: [Ẽ ′]n1 = k-best([f, E ]n1 , ~w)
2. Aggregate: [Ẽ ]n1 = [Ẽ ]n1 ∪ [Ẽ ′]n1
3. Train: ~w = BatchMIRA([f,R, Ẽ ]n1 , ~w)
4. Repeat

where BatchMIRA() trains the SMT-adapted MIRA
algorithm to completion on the current approxima-
tion Ẽ , without parallelization.3 The only change we
make to MIRA is to replace the hope-fear decoding
of sentences with the hope-fear re-ranking of k-best
lists. Despite its lack of parallelization, each call to
BatchMIRA() is extremely fast, as SMT tuning sets
are small enough to load all of [Ẽ ]n1 into memory. We
test two Batch MIRA variants, which differ in their
representation of Ẽ . Pseudo-code that covers both is
provided in Algorithm 1. Note that if we set Ẽ = E ,
Algorithm 1 also describes online MIRA.
Batch k-best MIRA inherits all of the MERT archi-
tecture. It is very easy to implement; the hope-fear
decoding steps can by carried out by simply evaluat-
ing BLEU score and model score for each hypothe-
sis in the k-best list.
Batch Lattice MIRA replaces k-best decoding in
step 1 with decoding to lattices. To enable loading
all of the lattices into memory at once, we prune to
a density of 50 edges per reference word. The hope-
fear decoding step requires the same oracle lattice
decoding algorithms as online MIRA (Chiang et al.,
2008). The lattice aggregation in the outer loop can
be kept reasonable by aggregating only those paths
corresponding to hope or fear derivations.

3.2 Structured SVM
While MIRA takes a series of local hinge-loss re-
ducing steps, it is also possible to directly minimize
the sum of hinge-losses using a batch algorithm, cre-
ating a structured SVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).
To avoid fixing an oracle before optimization begins,
we adapt Yu and Joachim’s (2009) latent SVM to
our task, which allows the oracle derivation for each
sentence to vary during training. Again we assume a
MERT-like architecture, which approximates E with
an Ẽ constructed from aggregated k-best lists.

Inspired by the local oracle of Liang et al. (2006),
we define Ẽi∗ to be an oracle set:

Ẽi∗ = {e|BLEUi(e) is maximal}.
3In our implementation, BatchMIRA() trains for J = 30

passes over [Ẽ ]n1 .

Cost is also defined in terms of the maximal BLEU,

∆i(e) = max
e′∈Ẽi

[
BLEUi(e

′)
]
− BLEUi(e).

Finally, loss is defined as:

`i(~w) = maxe∈Ẽi

[
∆i(e) + ~w · ~hi(e)
−maxe∗i∈Ẽi∗

(
~w · ~hi(e∗i )

)]
This loss is 0 only if some hypothesis in the oracle
set is separated from all others by a margin propor-
tional to their BLEUi differentials.

With loss defined in this manner, we can mini-
mize (4) to local minimum by using an alternating
training procedure. For each example i, we select
a fixed e∗i ∈ Ẽi∗ that maximizes model score; that
is, ~w is used to break ties in BLEU for oracle selec-
tion. With the oracle fixed, the objective becomes
a standard structured SVM objective, which can be
minimized using a cutting-plane algorithm, as de-
scribed by Tsochantaridis et al. (2004). After doing
so, we can drive the loss lower still by iterating this
process: re-select each oracle (breaking ties with the
new ~w), then re-optimize ~w. We do so 10 times. We

were surprised by the impact of these additional iter-
ations on the final loss; for some sentences, Ẽi∗ can
be quite large.

Despite the fact that both algorithms use a struc-
tured hinge loss, there are several differences be-
tween our SVM and MIRA. The SVM has an ex-
plicit regularization term λ that is factored into its
global objective, while MIRA regularizes implicitly
by taking small steps. The SVM requires a stable
objective to optimize, meaning that it must forgo the
pseudo-corpus used by MIRA to calculate ∆i; in-
stead, the SVM uses an interpolated sentence-level
BLEU (Liang et al., 2006).4 Finally, MIRA’s oracle
is selected with hope decoding. With a sufficiently
large ~w, any e ∈ Ẽ can potentially become the ora-
cle. In contrast, the SVM’s local oracle is selected
from a small set Ẽ∗, which was done to more closely
match the assumptions of the Latent SVM.

To solve the necessary quadratic programming
sub-problems, we use a multiclass SVM similar to
LIBLINEAR (Hsieh et al., 2008). Like Batch MIRA
and PRO, the actual optimization is very fast, as the
cutting plane converges quickly and all of [Ẽ ]n1 can
be loaded into memory at once.

3.3 Qualitative Summary

We have reviewed three tuning methods and intro-
duced three tuning methods. All six methods em-
ploy sentence-level loss functions, which in turn em-
ploy sentence-level BLEU approximations. Except
for online MIRA, all methods plug nicely into the
existing MERT architecture. These methods can be
split into two groups: MIRA variants (online, batch
k-best, batch lattice), and direct optimizers (PRO,
MR and SVM). The MIRA variants use pseudo-
corpus BLEU in place of smoothed BLEU, and
provide access to richer hypothesis spaces through
the use of online training or lattices.5 The direct
optimizers have access to a tunable regularization
parameter λ, and do not require special purpose
code for hope and fear lattice decoding. Batch

4SVM training with interpolated BLEU outperformed add-1
BLEU in preliminary testing. A comparison of different BLEU
approximations under different tuning objectives would be an
interesting path for future work.

5MR approaches that use lattices (Li and Eisner, 2009;
Pauls et al., 2009; Rosti et al., 2011) or the complete search
space (Arun et al., 2010) exist, but are not tested here.



k-best MIRA straddles the two groups, benefiting
from pseudo-corpus BLEU and easy implementa-
tion, while being restricted to a k-best list.

4 Experimental Design

We evaluated the six tuning strategies described
in this paper, along with two MERT baselines,
on three language pairs

(
French-English (Fr-En),

English-French (En-Fr) and Chinese-English (Zh-
En)
)
, across three different feature-set sizes. Each

setting was run five times over randomized variants
to improve reliability. To cope with the resulting
large number of configurations, we ran all experi-
ments using an efficient phrase-based decoder simi-
lar to Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).

All tuning methods that use an approximate Ẽ per-
form 15 iterations of the outer loop and return the
weights that achieve the best development BLEU
score. When present, λ was coarsely tuned (trying 3
values differing by magnitudes of 10) in our large-
feature Chinese-English setting.

• kb-mert : k-best MERT with 20 random
restarts. All k-best methods use k = 100.
• lb-mert : Lattice MERT (Machery et al., 2008)

using unpruned lattices and aggregating only
those paths on the line search’s upper envelope.
• mira : Online MIRA (§2.1). All MIRA vari-

ants use a pseudo-corpus decay γ = 0.999 and
C = 0.01. Online parallelization follows Mc-
Donald et al. (2010), using 8 shards. We tested
20, 15, 10, 8 and 5 shards during development.

moid sampler with both the initial and maxi-
mum sample size set to 100 pairs. For clas-
sification, we employ an in-house maximum
entropy classifier with a regularization weight
λ = 1000. We tried many variants of the pri-
mary sampler described by Hopkins and May
(2011), but we were unable to find settings for
it that worked well for all language pairs.

learning rate of η0/(1 + η0λt) for stochastic
gradient descent, with η0 tuned to optimize the
training loss achieved after one epoch (Bottou,

shuffle our data, re-tune our learning rate, and

cess 5 times. We do not sharpen our distribu-
tion with a temperature or otherwise control for

4.1 Data
Systems for English/French were trained on Cana-
dian Hansard data (years 2001–2009) summarized
in table 1.6 The dev and test sets were chosen
randomly from among the most recent 5 days of
Hansard transcripts.

The system for Zh-En was trained on data from
the NIST 2009 Chinese MT evaluation, summarized
in table 2. The dev set was taken from the NIST
05 evaluation set, augmented with some material re-
served from other NIST corpora. The NIST 04, 06,
and 08 evaluation sets were used for testing.

4.2 SMT Features
For all language pairs, phrases were extracted with
a length limit of 7 from separate word alignments
performed by IBM2 and HMM models and sym-
metrized using diag-and (Koehn et al., 2003). Con-
ditional phrase probabilities in both directions were

estimated from relative frequencies, and from lexical
probabilities (Zens and Ney, 2004). Language mod-
els were estimated with Kneser-Ney smoothing us-
ing SRILM. Six-feature lexicalized distortion mod-
els were estimated and applied as in Moses.

For each language pair, we defined roughly equiv-
alent systems (exactly equivalent for En-Fr and Fr-
En, which are mirror images) for each of three
nested feature sets: Small, Medium, and Big.

The Small set defines a minimal 7-feature sys-
tem intended to be within easy reach of all tuning
strategies. It comprises 4 TM features, one LM, and
length and distortion features. For the Chinese sys-
tem, the LM is a 5-gram trained on the NIST09 Gi-
gaword corpus; for English/French, it is a 4-gram
trained on the target half of the parallel Hansard.

The Medium set is a more competitive 18-feature
system. It adds 4 TM features, one LM, and 6 lex-
icalized distortion features. For Zh-En, Small’s TM
(trained on both train1 and train2 in table 2) is re-
placed by 2 separate TMs from these sub-corpora;
for En/Fr, the extra TM (4 features) comes from a
forced-decoding alignment of the training corpus, as
proposed by Wuebker et al. (2010). For Zh-En, the
extra LM is a 4-gram trained on the target half of the
parallel corpus; for En/Fr, it is a 4-gram trained on
5m sentences of similar parliamentary data.

The Big set adds sparse Boolean features to
Medium, for a maximum of 6,848 features. We used
sparse feature templates that are equivalent to the
PBMT set described in (Hopkins and May, 2011):
tgt unal picks out each of the 50 most frequent tar-
get words to appear unaligned in the phrase table;
count bin uniquely bins joint phrase pair counts with
upper bounds 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,1k,10k,∞; word
pair fires when each of the 80 most frequent words
in each language appear aligned 1-1 to each other, to
some other word, or not 1-1; and length bin captures

each possible phrase length and length pair. Table 3
summarizes the feature templates, showing the max-
imum number of features each can generate, and the
number of features that received non-zero weights in
the final model tuned by MR for each language pair.

Feature weights are initialized to 1.0 for each of
the TM, LM and distortion penalty features. All
other weights are initialized to 0.0.

4.3 Stability Testing

We follow Clark et al (2011), and perform multiple
randomized replications of each experiment. How-
ever, their method of using different random seeds
is not applicable in our context, since randomization
does not play the same role for all tuning methods.
Our solution was to randomly draw and fix four dif-
ferent sub-samples of each dev set, retaining each
sentence with a probability of 0.9. For each tuning
method and setting, we then optimize on the origi-
nal dev and all sub-samples. The resulting standard
deviations provide an indication of stability.

5 Results

The results of our survey of tuning methods can be
seen in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Results are averaged over
test sets (2 for Fr/En, 3 for Zh/En), and over 5 sub-
sampled runs per test set. The SD column reports the
standard deviation of the average test score across
the 5 sub-samples.

It may be dismaying to see only small score
improvements when transitioning from Medium to
Big. This is partially due to the fact that our Big fea-
ture set affects only phrase-table scores. Our phrase
tables are already strong, through our use of large
data or leave-one-out forced decoding. The impor-
tant baseline when assessing the utility of a method
is Medium k-best MERT. In all language pairs, our
Big systems generally outperform this baseline by
0.4 BLEU points. It is interesting to note that most
methods achieve the bulk of this improvement on the
Medium feature set.7 This indicates that MERT be-
gins to show some problems even in an 18-feature
setting, which can be mitigated through the use of
Lattice MERT.

When examining score differentials, recall that

7One can see the same phenomenon in the results of Hop-
kins and May (2011) as well.

Tune Test
Figure 1: French-English test of regularization with an over-fitting feature set. lb-mira varies C ={1, 1e-1, 1e-2, 1e-3}, its default
C is 1e-2; svm varies λ ={1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5}, its default λ is 1e3; mr varies λ ={5, 5e1, 5e2, 5e3}, its default λ is 5e1.



the reported scores average over multiple test sets
and sub-sampled tuning runs. Using Small features,
all of the tested methods are mostly indistinguish-
able, but as we move to Medium and Big, Batch
Lattice MIRA emerges as our method of choice. It
is the top scoring system in all Medium settings, and
in two of three Big settings (in Big Zh-En, the SVM
comes first, with batch lattice MIRA placing third).
However, all of the MIRA variants perform simi-
larly, though our implementation of online MIRA is
an order of magnitude slower, mostly due to its small
number of shards. It is interesting that our batch lat-
tice variant consistently outperforms online MIRA.
We attribute this to our parallelization strategy, Chi-
ang et al.’s (2008) more complex solution may per-
form better.

There may be settings where an explicit regular-
ization parameter is desirable, thus we also make a
recommendation among the direct optimizers (PRO,
MR and SVM). Though these systems all tend to
show a fair amount of variance across language and
feature sets (likely due to their use sentence-level
BLEU), MR performs the most consistently, and is
always within 0.2 of batch lattice MIRA.

The SVM’s performance on Big Zh-En is an in-
triguing outlier in our results. Note that it not only
performs best on the test set, but also achieves the
best tuning score by a large margin. We suspect
we have simply found a setting where interpolated
BLEU and our choice of λ work particularly well.
We intend to investigate this case to see if this level
of success can be replicated consistently, perhaps
through improved sentence BLEU approximation or
improved oracle selection.

5.1 Impact of Regularization
One main difference between MIRA and the direct
optimizers is the availability of an explicit regular-
ization term λ. To measure the impact of this param-
eter, we designed a feature set explicitly for over-
fitting. This set uses our Big Fr-En features, with the
count bin template modified to distinguish each joint
count observed in the tuning set. These new fea-
tures, which expand the set to 20k+ features, should
generalize poorly.

We tested MR and SVM on our Fr-En data us-
ing this feature set, varying their respective regular-
ization parameters by factors of 10. We compared

this to Batch Lattice MIRA’s step-size cap C, which
controls its regularization (Martins et al., 2010). The
results are shown in Figure 1. Looking at the tuning
scores, one can see that λ affords much greater con-
trol over tuning performance than MIRA’s C. Look-
ing at test scores, MIRA’s narrow band of regular-
ization appears to be just about right; however, there
is no reason to expect this to always be the case.

6 Conclusion

We have presented three new, large-margin tuning
methods for SMT that can handle thousands of fea-
tures. Batch lattice and k-best MIRA carry out their
online training within approximated search spaces,
reducing costs in terms of both implementation and
training time. The Structured SVM optimizes a sum
of hinge losses directly, exposing an explicit reg-
ularization term. We have organized the literature
on tuning, and carried out an extensive comparison
of linear-loss SMT tuners. Our experiments show
Batch Lattice MIRA to be the most consistent of the
tested methods. In the future, we intend to inves-
tigate improved sentence-BLEU approximations to
help narrow the gap between MIRA and the direct
optimizers.
