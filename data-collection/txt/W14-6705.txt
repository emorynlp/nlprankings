Abstract. Following the line of research introduced by (Baronchelli et al., 2006) and developed by (Brigatti, 2008),
this paper explores the impact of reputation in the process on linguistic convergence. To do that, we consider socie-
ties with two groups of asymmetrically distributed reputation, and simulate processes of language change under several
configurations of the society and values of reputation.

1 Introduction

To fully understand the dynamics of language change and evolution simple computational models are needed. These
models can help to simulate processes that cannot be completely explained only by using learning parameters in each
generation of speakers. The mechanisms underlying language change act not only across generations, but in the every
day utterances, and, because of this, language change is very fast. Furthermore, it is also remarkable that speakers are not
usually aware of most of the changes in their grammar and phonological systems.

The emergence of cognitive capacities that allow human beings to talk, as well as syntax and semantics, have been approa-
ched by several models that explain the arising of compositionality and the building of a common linguistic knowledge in
a society (Smith et al., 2003).

Language change and interaction, as well as approaches to language convergence and splitting, can take advantage of
these simple models launched to account for language evolution and emergence.

Among the proposals that have been introduced, one of the simplest experiments to understand language convergence is
the one by Baronchelli 2006. Baronchelli’s model is based in a variant of the naming game (Steels, 1997) strengthening the
feature of simplicity. In Baronchellis model, a number of agents have to agree in naming an object with no pre-established
protocol. Two chief features of the model are that : a) the agents have nothing in the beginning, and b) they delete every
word they have stored for an object when they agree with another individual. Mathematical and physical results obtained
by this model show how there is strong correlation between the parameters of the simulation (Baronchelli et al., 2006).

After Baronchelli’s work, Brigatti introduced the concept of reputation in the process of linguistic convergence, pointing
out the possibility of analyzing the influence of such parameter in language evolution. This is where the present paper is
placed. The main goal of this work is to pay some attention to the impact that different distributions of reputation in a
society can have to the final result of the process of linguistic convergence.

The method that has been used in the paper relates to complex adaptive systems (Holand, 2006) and complex network
theory (Strogatz, 2001). After defining some agents, they have to interact until they are able to create a society with a
linguistic code. Social networks (Wellman & Berkowitz, 1988) and social impact theory (Nettle, 1998) can help to un-
derstand the dynamics of these societies, and their input and output configuration. In other words, we claim that language
and linguistic interaction can change the configuration of the society and, to demonstrate that, we suggest the use of
computational simulations and the mathematical support that complex network theory provides.

To develop the topic, in Section 2 we introduce Baronchelli’s model with the parameter of reputation, slightly different
from the one offered by Brigatti. In Section 3, we study the main results of the model, offering a discussion in Section 4.

2 Convergence Model with Reputation

Brigatti introduces the concept of reputation in the simple Baronchelli’s scheme. The idea is very interesting because
it highlights the relevance of social position in language change. In (Brigatti, 2008) the main results of the model are
explained. One of the suggestions of this author is the study of the impact of reputation in a society with individuals
gathered in two groups of different status.

This paper deals with the process of linguistic convergence in societies with two different social groups, named H (High
reputation) and L (Low reputation), each one with a given reputation (RH and RL). The difference of reputation between
H and L (RH − RL) is denoted by δ. Following Brigatti’s assumption, communication between two agents Speaker (S)
and Hearer (E) is allowed even if they have two different values of Reputation (R). If the communication is successful -
if S and H share the word they exchange - the parameter of reputation does not play any role, but if communication fails
because a word W sent by S in not known by E, then reputation becomes a key parameter in the development of the
linguistic evolution of the society.

Establishing a rough parallelism between populations of agents and societies, we can say that we want to test the behaviour
of societies with two clearly different social groups, one of them (H) being more powerful (in a degree δ) than the other
(L). In such society everybody is allowed to communicate with everybody if they share the same linguistic items, but
individuals of L are not able to extend their words to individuals in H , or, in other words, people from H do not learn any
word from L. Our hypothesis is that, in such societies, linguistic confluence is always reached, but the time and memory
needed by the process varies depending on both the size of complementary groups H/L and δ.

When the evolution starts, every agent has an empty store and not predefined protocols are established. The algorithm for
communication is based in the one in (Brigatti, 2008) but it includes some modifications. It is the following :

– Speaker (S) and Hearer (E) are randomly selected.
– If H has words stored, it selects one. If not, it invents one.
– The speaker transmits the selected word to the hearer, characterized by the reputation RE
– If the hearer’s inventory contains such a word, the communication is a success. The two agents update their inventories

so as to keep only the word involved in the interaction. The speaker’s reputation increases by one.
– Otherwise, if RS > RE , the hearer adds the new word to its inventory and the speaker does nothing. The speaker’s

reputation decreases by one.
– If hearer’s inventory does not contain such a word and RS < RE , the communication is a failure. The speaker’s

reputation decreases by one.

In this model, success is not quantified, since this measure is not relevant for the study we are carrying out here.

The main aspects that will be investigated in this paper, are the following :

1. The influence of δ in the convergence process.

2. The influence of the distribution of H and L in the convergence process.

3. The evolution of R during the computation.

To do that, we study by means of computational simulations, the following general parameters :

– tconv , the total time the system takes to reach convergence
– Wmax, the maximum number of words the system reaches at time tmax
– Wdif , the maximum number of different words
– tmax, the time where the system gets Wmax
– Variation of RH and RL

3 Results

The results analyzed here are obtained with small populations of only 100 agents, averaged after 100 runs of the program.

The first value to analyze is tconv , showing the results summarized in Figure 1. There are several aspects worth to high-
light :

FIGURE 1 – Results of tconv with different values of δ

– δ is important in societies where H < 50% and very important when H < 30%. With L ≥ 50, it can be said that the
smaller H is, the greater is the impact of δ.

– In groups where H > 50%, the impact of δ is negligible.
– For societies with δ ≤ 10, H = 10% presents a more efficient behaviour than H = 90%. With other values of δ, the

configuration with H = 90% is clearly the fastest to achieve convergence. The difference in the results with H = 10%
and H = 90% increases proportionally to δ.

– Whereas the results obtained in societies withH ≤ 40% are clearly dependent on δ, the results with social distributions
where H ≥ 60% are only slightly dependent on δ, and with H = 90% the results are independent on δ, this is, there is
no influence of δ in the time these societies need to reach convergence.

Concerning these results, Brigatti, who tested a very similar program using only δ10, remarks that the consensus is easier
in authoritarian communities with a few individuals with high reputation. In our program, this could be said looking also to
the outcome with δ10. But with higher values of δ the interpretation is completely different. These communities get worst
results, showing that, finally, the totally reverse distribution, with H = 90 is more efficient for convergence, attending

FIGURE 3 – Wmax, Wdif with different values of δ and H

The behaviour of tmax, can be seen in Figure 2 (top). On the contrary than the values for tconv , the parameter δ does not
seem to have any influence in the final result, that shows a progressive increasing of the value with the higher H . Since
tmax is a parameter that is linked to Wmax, the relationship if the value with H can be explained in the following way.
In the system, agents belonging to both groups, H and L are allowed to produce new words, but H always have the final
winning word, in a way that, beingH smaller means having less competence, and this implies generating a smaller amount
of words. However, the comparison between tconv and tmax refers to another phenomenon. If populations with H = 10
reach soon tmax and get the worst results for tconv , this means that there is a hard “fight” to decide the final winning
word among a small number of them, and spread it in the large population L. This can be seen in Figure 2 (bottom), that
explains the relationship between tconv and tmax, and shows how systems with H ≥ 50 are more balanced in transitions
t0 to tmax and tmax to tconv .

mory the system needs to perform the operations to reach the convergence. Figure 3 shows the outcome of the simulation
for different values of δ.

The parameter Wmax has extremely similar results with every δ, with small variation depending on H/L. The value
increases from H = 10% to H = 90% with almost the same results in any case. An exception to this rule is found with
H = 20%, whose results are always lower than the ones with H = 10%. This confirms, again, the difficulty the system
finds to converge with a distribution of the H = 10% with high values of δ.

Wdif follows a convex distribution. Like in Wmax, δ does not seem to have a great impact in the final result. In all
cases, the initial left end is 88/89 and the right end is 92/93. The peak is achieved at H = 40% for δ10 and δ20, in
H = 40%, 50% for δ50 and in the segment H = 30%− 50% for δ100, δ150.

FIGURE 5 – Social dynamics established to reach the consensus in two societies with different distribution of Reputation
and social groups. Top δ50, 50/10. Bottom δ50, 50/50

The last aspect that we are approaching in this article is the variation of R along the computation. To do that, we check
the average difference between the initial and the final reputation in H and L, as it can be seen in Figure 4. As a general
tendency, the whole population looses reputation, but the group H looses more than L, like following a rule “if you have
more, you lose more”. Even though, in general, there is not a relationship between the initialR and the reputation an agent



[RLTLN-O.5]

311

loses. Moreover, there is another unexpected fact, again with populations with H ≤ 10. In these populations, with high
values of δ, the group L strikingly increases the values of R while H decreases such values in the same way.

From here, a prediction can be inferred and should be tested in the future : running different processes of linguistic
confluence in societies with asymmetrically distributed R and inheritance of R would give rise to equal R populations.

The social dynamics of the game has been also studied, as can be seen Figure 5. This work is based in the hypothesis that
creating language has to do with social interaction, and that while language is in process of convergence, the structure of
the society is transforming or emerging. If the society is represented by a dynamic graph, the evolution of the network can
show the dynamics of the society. In our simulation, we are using only 20 agents for the sake of clarity. This small sample
reproduces in a reduced scale what happens in large societies. At the beginning the agents do not have any connection. For
every successful linguistic interaction, an edge is created between S and E. For every unsuccessful interaction between
two nodes, if they are joint by an edge, this is removed. The first picture of Figure 5 represents the final state of a very small
society with a difference of reputation δ50 and only the 10% with the highest degree. The picture at the bottom shows
how the society with the same value of δ and two different social groups H and L of the same size, reaches a consensus
with a considerable faster social negotiation. Therefore, following the model, it can be stated that taking decisions is way
more difficult with a small group with higher power.

4 Discussion

This paper highlights the role of reputation in language change, starting from a very simple model (Baronchelli et al.,
2006) without pre-established protocols in the agents. The work shows that there are two different parameters, the dis-
tribution of reputation in a society and the difference between both groups, that have an influence on the evolution of
language.

Considering the efficiency of the systems, the ones using less time and memory in their operations, the conclusions we
can extract from these simulations, are the following :

– In terms of time, with values of δ > 10, systems converge faster with configurations where H is 90%.
– In terms of memory, the best configurations are achieved with H ≤ 40 for Wmax and H = 40 for Wdif .
– Considering time/space categories, an optimal configuration of society for fast and efficient convergence would be one

with H = 10/20 and δ ≤ 10. But looking at general conditions, it can be said that systems with H/L ≈ 1 assure a fast
convergence with almost every value of δ.

As for the variation of reputation, the results suggest that after a number of processes the whole population would have
similar levels ofR, in a way that δ → 0. A question for the future would be demonstrating this rule by applying simulations
many times in the same population with inheritance of R.

For the future, it could be interesting to explore if some other models of language learning and transmission that seem
to be more realistic allow the application of reputation in their formalization. The final result of this research can be to
remark the importance of social structures in language evolution and change.
