Abstract 

One of the main approaches to extract multi-word units is the frequency threshold approach, but the way 
this approach considers dispersion data still leaves a lot to be desired. This study adopts Gries’s (2008) 
dispersion measure to extract trigrams from a Chinese corpus, and the results are compared with those 
of the frequency threshold approach. It is found that the overlap between the two approaches is not very 
large. This demonstrates the necessity of taking dispersion data more seriously and the dynamic nature 
of lexical representations. Moreover, the trigrams extracted in the present study can be used in a wide 
range of language resources in Chinese. 

1 Introduction 
In the past decades, multi-word units have been of great interest not only to corpus linguists but also to 
cognitive linguists and psycholinguists. It has been empirically demonstrated that multi-word units are 
pervasive in our languages (cf. Wray and Perkins, 2000), and they are considered psychologically real 
when it is found that a language learner starts with formulaic phrases that serve specific functions (e.g., 
Ellis, 2003; Tomasello, 2003). One of the current approaches to extract multi-word units is the 
frequency threshold approach (cf. Wei and Li, 2013). 

The frequency threshold approach reflects the argument that frequently used items are more 
entrenched in our mind. While many have recognized that frequency data are more useful when 
complemented with dispersion data (e.g., Juilland et al., 1970), the way the frequency threshold 
approach considers the dispersion of a multi-word unit still leaves a lot to be desired. For example, 
when automatically extracting multi-word units in English, Gray and Biber (2013) simply set a 
dispersion threshold, i.e., occurring in at least five corpus texts. 

Therefore, the present study aims to probe more deeply into the interaction between the frequency 
data and the dispersion data of multi-word units. Both a frequency-based set of multi-word units and a 
dispersion-based set are automatically extracted from a Chinese corpus, and the two sets are compared. 
The present study adopts a more scientific method to compute the dispersion of a multi-word unit, i.e., 
the DP value (Gries, 2008). This method is argued to be more flexible, simple, extendable, and 
sensitive than previous methods (Gries, 2008:425-426). Note that given the limited resources, the 
present study focuses on three-word units (trigrams for short, hereafter). 

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the method of the present study. Section 3 
presents the results. Section 4 is a general discussion of the findings and the implications. Section 5 
highlights the contributions of the findings. 

2 Method 
The corpus for the present study is the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Chinese (the 
Sinica Corpus, hereafter).1 The fourth edition contains 11,245,853 tokens.

This study adopted a fully inductive approach to identify trigrams in Chinese. A computer program 
run in R automatically retrieved trigrams in the Sinica Corpus. Each trigram did not cross a 
punctuation boundary in a written text or a turn boundary in a spoken text. Then, the raw occurrence 
of each trigram was counted, and the raw occurrence was also normalized to the relative frequency in 
one million words. A frequency threshold was set to be 5 occurrences in one million words, and 1,279 
trigrams passed the threshold. For each of them, the dispersion value was calculated.2 

Regarding the dispersion value, the present study adopted Gries’s (2008) measure. First, the corpus 
was roughly evenly divided into ten parts. Next, the raw occurrence of each trigram in each part was 
counted. Then, the dispersion value was calculated as shown in Table 1. Take the trigram shi yi ge ‘be 
a CLASSIFIER’, for example. Given that the first part of the corpus (1,081,955 tokens altogether) 
accounts for 9.6% of all the corpus data, the raw occurrences of shi yi ge in the first corpus part should 
also account for 9.6% of its overall occurrences. However, the observed frequency of shi yi ge in the 
first part (405/2,931 = 13.8%) was found to be slightly higher than its expected frequency. The 
absolute difference for each corpus part (shown in the third column) was summed up (shown in the 
fourth column), and the sum was divided by 2. The figure in the fifth column was the dispersion value 
for the trigram shi yi ge. The dispersion value always falls between 0 and 1: the lower the value is, the 
more evenly dispersed the trigram is in the corpus.

After the dispersion value for each of the 1,279 trigrams was calculated, the top 300 trigrams in the 
frequency-based list and the top 300 trigrams in the dispersion-based list were further analyzed

2 The present study aims to compare frequency-based and dispersion-based trigrams, and the best way would be to compute 
the dispersion value for all the trigrams automatically extracted from the corpus. This, however, seems to be too difficult 
because this approach could be resource-intensive. Therefore, the present study set a frequency threshold to obtain a 
computationally reasonable number of trigrams, and computed the dispersion value for each trigram that passed that 
frequency threshold. Actually, the frequency threshold of the present study is relatively low.

shown in Table 2. 

 
Category Definition Example 
verb trigrams trigrams that contain at least one verb you ren shuo 

‘have person 
said’ 

finite trigrams trigrams that contain a copula (e.g., shi ‘be’) 
and/or a modal verb (e.g., hui ‘can’), but not a 
verb 

zhe ye shi ‘this 
is also’ 

content word trigrams trigrams that contain at least one content word 
(i.e., a noun, an adjective, and an adverb), but 
not a verb or a finite 

shi nian qian 
‘ten years ago’

function word trigrams trigrams that contain only function words ling yi ge 
‘another one 
CLASSIFIER’ 

incomprehensibly 
incomplete trigrams 

trigrams that are structurally and/or 
semantically incomplete and 
incomprehensible

3 Results 
The total numbers of trigram types at different frequency thresholds (per one million words) are 
presented in Table 3. The following discussions will center around trigrams that occur five or more 
times per one million words.

Figure 1 presents the frequency distribution (per one million words) of the 1,279 trigrams, which 

occur five or more times. Among all the trigrams here, the most frequent one is shi yi ge ‘be one 
CLASSIFIER’ (260.62 times per one million words), and the least frequent one is zhongyao de shi 
‘important DE thing’ (5.07 times).

trigrams to be hand-coded.

Figure 2 presents the distribution of the dispersion values of the 1,279 trigrams, which occur five or 
more times. Among all the trigrams here, the best-dispersed one is zhe ye shi ‘this also be’ (0.0375), 
and the one with the highest dispersion value is kaifang kongjian zhi ‘open space ZHI’ (0.9085). As 
Figure 2 shows, the majority of trigrams are quite well-dispersed across the corpus (i.e., most of the 
dispersion values are lower than 0.4).

When zooming in to examine the top 300 trigrams in the frequency-based list and the top 300 

trigrams in the dispersion-based list, we can find that there is an overlap of 126 trigrams (only 42%) 
between the two list. Table 4 summarizes the category distributions of the top 300 trigrams in the 
frequency-based list, the top 300 trigrams in the dispersion-based list, and the 126 trigrams in the 
overlap.

4 Discussion 
Overall, whether from the frequency-based perspective or from the dispersion-based perspective, 
content word trigrams are the most dominant. This is not too surprising, for this category covers a 
wide range of word classes (i.e., nouns, adjectives, and adverbs). In Chinese, finite trigrams are also 
frequent and well-dispersed, perhaps because the finite serves many interpersonal metafunctions (i.e., 
expressing the polarity of a sentence/utterance) (Thompson, 1996). In this category, shi ‘be’ is the 
most frequent. The main difference between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-based 
approach is that the former extracts more function word trigrams, while the latter extracts more 
incomprehensibly incomplete trigrams. 

Additionally, as shown in Table 4, the overlap between the two approaches is not very large (i.e., 
126/300 = 42%). Now, consider Table 5. 
 
 
 

102



Top n trigrams in the two lists Overlap 
300 126/300 = 42% 
500 262/500 =  52.4% 
700 438/700 =  62.6% 

1,000 798/1,000 = 79.8% 
1,279 1,279/1,279 = 100% 

Table 5. The overlap between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-based approach. 
 
Since the trigrams in the two lists are the same, the overlap should be getting larger as n is getting 
larger. However, even when n reaches 700, the overlap between the two approaches is only slightly 
more than half. This suggests that when a certain type number is set (e.g., 300, 500, or 700), the 
frequency-based approach and the dispersion-based approach can extract quite different sets of 
trigrams.  

Some may argue that the frequency-based approach is more useful because it extracts fewer 
incomprehensibly incomplete trigrams (cf. Table 4). On the other hand, we can also see the dispersion 
value as an ancillary measure to the relative frequency, just as the standard deviation is usually 
presented whenever a mean is presented. Frequencies can be regarded as an important dimension of 
the sum of one’s linguistic experience (cf. Bybee, 2006), and dispersion data should also be considered 
so. Items, whether single words or multi-word units, that achieve a high frequency and are 
well-dispersed across the corpus should be much more entrenched in the mental lexicon, for their 
frequent occurrences are ubiquitous, not just in certain text types. These items should deserve more 
attention from linguists and may be more useful in a language resource. 

Moreover, the findings of the present study have demonstrated the dynamic nature of lexical 
representations. When different measures (e.g., the relative frequency, the dispersion value) are used, 
the ranking of a trigram may change dramatically. If the association measure is also taken into account 
or different measures are integrated in a certain way, another picture of trigrams in Chinese may 
emerge. This echoes Biber’s (2009) suggestion that in the extraction of multi-word units, no 
methodology should be considered to be correct. That is to say, different sets of multi-word units 
extracted by different approaches can all be useful in one way or another and reflective of some 
aspects of our cognition. However, those ranking high in all the approaches may be at the core of our 
mental lexicon.  

The implications of a list of trigrams (or other multi-word units) in Chinese can be pinpointed as 
follows. First, most dictionaries in Chinese compile words, but a dictionary of multi-word units in 
Chinese can also be of great use. For example, the trigram you yi ge ‘have one CLASSIFER’ is usually 
used to introduce a new topic in discourse, and this needs to be included in a dictionary in Chinese. 
Second, such useful sequences as you yi ge can also be included in teaching materials for language 
learners. Third, we can try to use automatically extracted sequences to build a language/lexical 
resource like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990). In such a resource (i.e., perhaps something like the Net of 
Multi-word Units), multi-word units in Chinese can be organized according to words or characters 
contained in them or even according to their discourse functions (and perhaps in some other creative 
ways), and lexical relations between multi-word units can be coded.  

5 Conclusion 
The contribution of the present study is twofold. Methodologically speaking, this study adopts a more 
sensitive dispersion measure (i.e., Gries, 2008) instead of setting an arbitrary dispersion threshold (e.g., 
occurring in at least five corpus files), and demonstrates that dispersion data are needed in the 
automatic extraction of multi-word units since those ranking high in a frequency-based list are not 
necessarily at the top of a dispersion-based list. It is argued that the dispersion of a multi-word unit, 
together with its frequency, can contribute to the entrenchment of the item in the mental lexicon 
because the dispersion measure reveals where a language user is confronted with the item. Practically 
speaking, trigrams in the overlap between the frequency-based approach and the dispersion-based 
approach may be at the core of the Chinese lexicon and can serve as a point of departure for future 
linguistic studies and resources in Chinese. 

103



The present study can be extended in the following directions. First, some evaluations from 
psycholinguistic experiments are needed to further examine the role of frequency data and dispersion 
data in the mental lexicon. Second, the same method can be adopted to automatically extract 
multi-word units in different genres, and the results will be helpful for genre studies.
