Abstract

Previous work on extracting ideology
from text has focused on domains where
expression of political views is expected,
but it’s unclear if current technology can
work in domains where displays of ide-
ology are considered inappropriate. We
present a supervised ensemble n-gram
model for ideology extraction with topic
adjustments and apply it to one such do-
main: research papers written by academic
economists. We show economists’ polit-
ical leanings can be correctly predicted,
that our predictions generalize to new do-
mains, and that they correlate with public
policy-relevant research findings. We also
present evidence that unsupervised models
can under-perform in domains where ide-
ological expression is discouraged.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in text mining demonstrate that
political ideology can be predicted from text –
often with great accuracy. Standard experimen-
tal settings in this literature are ones where ide-
ology is explicit, such as speeches by American
politicians or editorials by Israeli and Palestinian
authors. An open question is whether ideology
can be detected in arenas where it is strongly dis-
couraged. A further consideration for applied re-
searchers is whether these tools can offer insight
into questions of import for policymakers. To ad-
dress both of these issues, we examine one such
domain that is both policy-relevant and where ide-
ology is not overtly expressed: research papers
written by academic economists.

Why economics? Economic ideas are important
for shaping policy by influencing the public debate
and setting the range of expert opinion on various
policy options (Rodrik, 2014). Economics also

views itself as a science (Chetty, 2013) carefully
applying rigorous methodologies and using insti-
tutionalized safe-guards such as peer review. The
field’s most prominent research organization ex-
plicitly prohibits researchers from making policy
recommendations in papers that it releases (Na-
tional Bureau of Economic Research, 2010). De-
spite these measures, economics’ close proximity
to public policy decisions have led many to see it
as being driven by ideology (A.S., 2010). Does
this view of partisan economics have any empiri-
cal basis?

To answer the question of whether economics
is politicized or neutral, we present a supervised
ensemble n-gram model of ideology extraction
with topic adjustments.1 Our methodology is most
closely related to Taddy (2013) and Gentzkow and
Shapiro (2010), the latter of which used χ2 tests
to find phrases most associated with ideology as
proxied by the language of U.S. Congresspersons.
We improve on this methodology by accounting
for ideological word choice within topics and in-
corporating an ensemble approach that increases
predictive accuracy. We also motivate the need to
adjust for topics even if doing so does not improve
accuracy (although it does in this case). We further
provide evidence that fully unsupervised methods
(Mei et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008; Ahmed and
Xing, 2010; Paul and Girju, 2010; Eisenstein et
al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) may encounter dif-
ficulties learning latent ideological aspects when
those aspects are not first order in the data.

Our algorithm is able to correctly predict the
ideology of 69.2% of economists in our data
purely from their academic output. We also show
that our predictions generalize and are predictors
of responses by a panel of top economists on is-
sues of economic importance. In a companion
paper (Jelveh et al., 2014), we further show that

models used for ideology detection.

predicted ideologies are significantly correlated
to economists’ research findings. The latter re-
sult shows the relevance and applicability of these
tools beyond the task of ideology extraction.

2 Data

Linking Economists to Their Political Activity:
We obtain the member directory of the Ameri-
can Economics Association (AEA) and link it to
two datasets: economists’ political campaign con-
tributions and petition signing activities. We ob-
tain campaign contribution data from the Federal
Election Commission’s website and petition sign-
ing data from Hedengren et al. (2010). From this
data, we construct a binary variable to indicate the
ground-truth ideologies of economists. See our
companion paper (Jelveh et al., 2014) for further
details on the construction of this dataset. Re-
vealed ideology through contributions and peti-
tions is largely consistent. Of 441 economists
appearing in both datasets, 83.4% showed agree-
ment between contributions and petitions. For
the final dataset of ground-truth authors we in-
clude all economists with campaign contribu-
tions and/or petition signatures, however, we drop
those economists whose ideologies where differ-
ent across the contribution and petition datasets.
Overall, 60% of 2,204 economists with imputed
ideologies in this final dataset are left-leaning
while 40% lean rightwards.

Economic Papers Corpus: To create our cor-
pus of academic writings by economists, we col-
lect 17,503 working papers from NBER’s website
covering June 1973 to October 2011. We also ob-
tained from JSTOR the fulltext of 62,888 research
articles published in 93 journals in economics for
the years 1991 to 2008. Combining the set of
economists and papers leaves us with 2,171 au-
thors with ground truth ideology and 17,870 pa-
pers they wrote. From the text of these papers we
create n-grams of length two through eight. While
n-grams greater than three words in length are un-
common, Margolin et al. (2013) demonstrate that
ideological word choice can be detected by longer
phrases. To capture other expressions of ideol-
ogy not revealed in adjacent terms, we also in-
clude skipgrams of length two by combining non-
adjacent terms that are three to five words apart.
We remove phrases used by fewer than five au-
thors.

Topic Adjustments: Table 1 presents the top

20 most conservative and liberal bigrams ranked
by χ2 scores from a Pearson’s test of indepen-
dence between phrase usage by left- and right-
leaning economists. It appears that top ideo-
logical phrases are related to specific research
subfields. For example, right-leaning terms
‘free bank’, ‘stock return’, and ‘feder reserv’ are
related to finance and left-leaning terms ‘men-
tal health’, ‘child care’, and ‘birth weight’ are re-
lated to health care. This observation leads us to
ask: Are apparently ideological phrases merely
a by-product of an economist’s research interest
rather than reflective of true ideology?

To see why this is a critical question, consider
that ideology has both direct and indirect effects
on word choice, the former of which is what we
wish to capture. The indirect pathway is through
topic: ideology may influence the research area
an economist enters into, but not the word choice
within that area. In that case, if more conserva-
tive economists choose macroeconomics, the ob-
served correlation between macro-related phrases
and right-leaning ideology would be spurious. The
implication is that accounting for topics may not
necessarily improve performance but provide evi-
dence to support an underlying model of how ide-
ology affects word choice. Therefore, to better
capture the direct effect of ideology on phrase us-
age we adjust our predictions by topic by creating
mappings from papers to topics. For a topic map-
ping, we predict economists’ ideologies from their
word choice within each topic and combine these
results to form and overall prediction. We com-
pare different supervised and unsupervised topic
mappings and assess their predictive ability.

To create supervised topic mappings, we take
advantage of the fact that economics papers are
manually categorized by the Journal of Economic
Literature (JEL). These codes are hierarchical in-
dicators of an article’s subject area. For exam-
ple, the code C51 can be read, in increasing order
of specificity, as Mathematical and Quantitative
Methods (C), Econometric Modeling (C5), Model
Construction and Estimation (C51). We construct
two sets of topic mappings: JEL1 derived from
the 1st-level codes (e.g. C) and JEL2 derived from
the 2nd-level codes (e.g. C5). The former cov-
ers broad areas (e.g. macroeconomics, microeco-
nomics, etc.) while the latter contains more refined
ones (e.g. monetary policy, firm behavior, etc.).

For unsupervised mappings, we run Latent

Dirichilet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) on our cor-
pus. We use 30, 50, and 100 topics to create
LDA30, LDA50, and LDA100 topic mappings.
We use the topic distributions estimated by LDA
to assign articles to topics. A paper p is assigned
to a topic t if the probability that t appears in p
is greater than 5%. While 5% might seem to be a
lower threshold, the topic distributions estimated
by LDA tend to be sparse. For example, even with
50 topics to ‘choose’ from in LDA50 and a thresh-
old of 5%, 99.5% of the papers would be assigned
to five or fewer topics. This compares favorably
with JEL2 codings where 98.8% of papers have
five or fewer topics.

3 Algorithm

There are two components to our topic-adjusted
algorithm for ideology prediction. First, we focus
on n-grams and skipgrams that are most correlated
with ideology in the training data. For each topic
within a topic mapping, we count the total num-
ber of times each phrase is used by all left- and
all right-leaning economists. Then, we compute
Pearson’s χ2 statistic and associated p-values and
keep phrases with p ≤ 0.05. As an additional fil-
ter, we split the data into ten folds and perform the

χ2 test within each fold. For each topic, we keep
phrases that are consistently ideological across all
folds. This greatly reduces the number of ideo-
logical phrases. For LDA50, the mean number of
ideological phrases per topic before the cross val-
idation filter is 12,932 but falls to 963 afterwards.

With the list of ideological phrases in hand, the
second step is to iterate over each topic and predict
the ideologies of economists in our test set. To
compute the predictions we perform partial least
squares (PLS): With our training data, we con-
struct the standardized frequency matrix Ft,train
where the (e, p)-th entry is the number of times
economist e used partisan phrase p across all of
e’s papers in t. This number is divided by the total
number of phrases used by e in topic t. For papers
with multiple authors, each author gets same count
of phrases. About 5% of the papers in our dataset
are written by authors with differing ideologies.
We do not treat these differently. Columns of
Ft,train are standardized to have unit variance. Let
y be the vector of ground-truth ideologies, test set
ideologies are predicted as follows:

1) Compute w = Corr(Ft,train,y), the corre-
lations between each phrase and ideology

2) Project to one dimension: z = Ft,trainw
3) Regress ideology, y, on the constructed vari-

able z: y = b1 z
4) Predict ideology ŷe of new economist by
ŷe = b1f̃e

′
w, (f̃e is scaled frequency vector)

To avoid over-fitting we introduce an ensemble
element: For each t, we sample from the list of
significant n-grams in t and sample with replace-
ment from the authors who have written in t.2 PLS
is performed on this sample data 125 times. Each
PLS iteration can be viewed as a vote on whether
an author is left- or right-leaning. We calculate
the vote as follows. For each iteration, we pre-
dict the ideologies of economists in the training
data. We find the threshold f that minimizes the
distance between the true and false positive rates
for the current iteration and the same rates for the
perfect classifier: 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. Then,
an author in the test set is voted left-leaning if
yt,test ≤ f and right-leaning otherwise.

For a given topic mapping, our algorithm re-
turns a three-dimensional array with the (e, t, c)-th
entry representing the number of votes economist
e received in topic t for ideology c (left- or right-

leaning). To produce a final prediction, we sum
across the second dimension and compute ideol-
ogy as the percentage of right-leaning votes re-
ceived across all topics within a topic-mapping.
Therefore, ideology values closer to zero are as-
sociated with a left-leaning ideology and values
closer to one are associated with a rightward lean.

To recap, we start with a topic mapping and then
for each topic run an ensemble algorithm with PLS
at its core.3 The output for each topic is a set of
votes. We sum across topics to compute a final
prediction for ideology.

4 Validation and Results

We split our ground-truth set of 2,171 authors
into training (80%) and test sets (20%) and com-
pute predictions as above. As our data exhibits
skew with 1.5 left-leaning for every right-leaning
economist, we report the area under the curve
(AUC) which is robust to class skew (Fawcett,
2006). It’s worth noting that a classifier that ran-
domly predicts a liberal economist 60% of the
time would have an AUC of 0.5. To compare
our model with fully unsupervised methods, we
also include results from running the Topic-Aspect
Model (TAM) (Paul and Girju, 2010) on our data.
TAM decomposes documents into two compo-
nents: one affecting topics and one affecting a la-
tent aspect that influences all topics in a similar
manner. We run TAM with 30 topics and 2 aspects
(TAM2/30). We follow Paul and Girju and use the
learned topic and aspect distributions as training
data for a SVM.4

Columns 2 to 4 from Table 2 show that our
models’ predictions have a clear association with
ground-truth ideology. The LDA topic mappings
outperform the supervised mappings as well as a
model that does not adjust for topics (NoTopic).
Perhaps not surprisingly, TAM does not perform
well in our domain. A drawback of unsupervised
methods is that the learned aspects may not be re-
lated to ideology but some other hidden factor.

For further insight into how well our model
generalizes, we use data from Gordon and Dahl
(2013) to compare our predictions to potentially
ideological responses of economists on a survey

3Other predictions algorithms could be dropped in for
PLS. Logistic regression and SVM produced similar results.

4Authors are treated as documents. TAM is run for 1,000
iterations with the following priors: α = 1.0, β = 1.0, γ0 =
1, γ1 = 1, δ0 = 20, δ1 = 80.

survey question asks for an economists opinion on
an issue of political relevance such as minimum
wages or tax rates. For further details on the data

Gordon and Dahl categorize 22 questions where
agreement (disagreement) with the statement im-
plies belief a conservative (liberal) viewpoint.

To see if our predicted ideologies are corre-
lated with survey responses, we run an ordered-
logistic regression (McCullagh, 1980). Survey
responses are coded with the following order:

Strongly Agree. We regress survey responses onto
predicted ideologies. We also include question-

spondent’s gender, year of Ph.D., Ph.D. univer-
sity, NBER membership, and experience in federal
government. Table 3 shows the results of these re-
gressions for three topic mappings. The correla-
tion between our predictions and survey respon-
dents are all strongly significant.

One way to interpret these results is to com-
pare the change in predicted probability of pro-
viding an Agree or Strongly Agree answer (agree-
ing with the conservative view point) if we change
predicted ideology from most liberal to most con-
servative. For NoTopic, this predicted probabil-
ity is 35% when ideology is set to most liberal
and jumps to 73.7% when set to most conserva-
tive. This difference increases for topic-adjusted
models. For LDA50, the probability of a conser-
vative answer when ideology is set to most liberal
is 14.5% and 93.8% for most conservative.

Figure 1 compares the predicted probabilities of
choosing different answers when ideology is set
to most liberal and most conservative. Our topic-
adjusted models suggest that the most conserva-
tive economists are much more likely to strongly
agree with a conservative response than for the
most liberal economists to strongly agree with a
liberal response. It is worthwhile to note from
the small increase in log-likelihood in Table 3
when controls are added, suggesting that our ide-
ology scores are much better predictors of IGM
responses than demographic and professional con-
trols.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

We’ve presented a supervised methodology for ex-
tracting political sentiment in a domain where it’s
discouraged and shown how it even predicts the
partisanship calculated from completely unrelated
IGM survey data. In a companion paper (Jelveh et
al., 2014) we further demonstrate how this tool can
be used to aid policymakers in de-biasing research
findings. When compared to domains where ideo-
logical language is expected, our predictive ability
is reduced. Future work should disentangle how
much this difference is due to modeling decisions
and limitations versus actual absence of ideology.
Future works should also investigate how fully un-
supervised methods can be extended to match our
performance.
