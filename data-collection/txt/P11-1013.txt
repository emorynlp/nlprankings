Abstract

Joint sentiment-topic (JST) model was previ-
ously proposed to detect sentiment and topic
simultaneously from text. The only super-
vision required by JST model learning is
domain-independent polarity word priors. In
this paper, we modify the JST model by in-
corporating word polarity priors through mod-
ifying the topic-word Dirichlet priors. We
study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by
JST and show that by augmenting the original
feature space with polarity-bearing topics, the
in-domain supervised classifiers learned from
augmented feature representation achieve the
state-of-the-art performance of 95% on the
movie review data and an average of 90% on
the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Further-
more, using feature augmentation and selec-
tion according to the information gain criteria
for cross-domain sentiment classification, our
proposed approach performs either better or
comparably compared to previous approaches.
Nevertheless, our approach is much simpler
and does not require difficult parameter tun-
ing.

1 Introduction
Given a piece of text, sentiment classification aims
to determine whether the semantic orientation of the
text is positive, negative or neutral. Machine learn-
ing approaches to this problem (?; ?; ?; ?; ?; ?) typ-
ically assume that classification models are trained
and tested using data drawn from some fixed distri-
bution. However, in many practical cases, we may
have plentiful labeled examples in the source do-
main, but very few or no labeled examples in the

target domain with a different distribution. For ex-
ample, we may have many labeled books reviews,
but we are interested in detecting the polarity of
electronics reviews. Reviews for different produces
might have widely different vocabularies, thus clas-
sifiers trained on one domain often fail to produce
satisfactory results when shifting to another do-
main. This has motivated much research on sen-
timent transfer learning which transfers knowledge
from a source task or domain to a different but re-
lated task or domain (?; ?; ?; ?).

Joint sentiment-topic (JST) model (?; ?) was ex-
tended from the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
model (?) to detect sentiment and topic simultane-
ously from text. The only supervision required by
JST learning is domain-independent polarity word
prior information. With prior polarity words ex-
tracted from both the MPQA subjectivity lexicon1

and the appraisal lexicon2, the JST model achieves
a sentiment classification accuracy of 74% on the
movie review data3 and 71% on the multi-domain
sentiment dataset4. Moreover, it is also able to ex-
tract coherent and informative topics grouped under
different sentiment. The fact that the JST model
does not required any labeled documents for training
makes it desirable for domain adaptation in senti-
ment classification. Many existing approaches solve
the sentiment transfer problem by associating words

from different domains which indicate the same sen-
timent (?; ?). Such an association mapping problem
can be naturally solved by the posterior inference in
the JST model. Indeed, the polarity-bearing topics
extracted by JST essentially capture sentiment asso-
ciations among words from different domains which
effectively overcome the data distribution difference
between source and target domains.

The previously proposed JST model uses the sen-
timent prior information in the Gibbs sampling in-
ference step that a sentiment label will only be sam-
pled if the current word token has no prior sentiment
as defined in a sentiment lexicon. This in fact im-
plies a different generative process where many of
the word prior sentiment labels are observed. The
model is no longer “latent”. We propose an alter-
native approach by incorporating word prior polar-
ity information through modifying the topic-word
Dirichlet priors. This essentially creates an informed
prior distribution for the sentiment labels and would
allow the model to actually be latent and would be
consistent with the generative story.

We study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by
the JST model and show that by augmenting the
original feature space with polarity-bearing topics,
the performance of in-domain supervised classifiers
learned from augmented feature representation im-
proves substantially, reaching the state-of-the-art re-
sults of 95% on the movie review data and an aver-
age of 90% on the multi-domain sentiment dataset.
Furthermore, using simple feature augmentation,
our proposed approach outperforms the structural
correspondence learning (SCL) (?) algorithm and
achieves comparable results to the recently proposed
spectral feature alignment (SFA) method (?). Never-
theless, our approach is much simpler and does not
require difficult parameter tuning.

We proceed with a review of related work on
sentiment domain adaptation. We then briefly de-
scribe the JST model and present another approach
to incorporate word prior polarity information into
JST learning. We subsequently show that words
from different domains can indeed be grouped un-
der the same polarity-bearing topic through an illus-
tration of example topic words extracted by JST be-
fore proposing a domain adaptation approach based
on JST. We verify our proposed approach by con-
ducting experiments on both the movie review data

and the multi-domain sentiment dataset. Finally, we
conclude our work and outline future directions.

2 Related Work
There has been significant amount of work on algo-
rithms for domain adaptation in NLP. Earlier work
treats the source domain data as “prior knowledge”
and uses maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation to
learn a model for the target domain data under this
prior distribution (?). Chelba and Acero (?) also
uses the source domain data to estimate prior dis-
tribution but in the context of a maximum entropy
(ME) model. The ME model has later been studied
in (?) for domain adaptation where a mixture model
is defined to learn differences between domains.

Other approaches rely on unlabeled data in the
target domain to overcome feature distribution dif-
ferences between domains. Motivated by the alter-
nating structural optimization (ASO) algorithm (?)
for multi-task learning, Blitzer et al. (?) proposed
structural correspondence learning (SCL) for do-
main adaptation in sentiment classification. Given
labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled
data from target domain, SCL selects a set of pivot
features to link the source and target domains where
pivots are selected based on their common frequency
in both domains and also their mutual information
with the source labels.

There has also been research in exploring care-
ful structuring of features for domain adaptation.
Daumé (?) proposed a kernel-mapping function
which maps both source and target domains data to
a high-dimensional feature space so that data points
from the same domain are twice as similar as those
from different domains. Dai et al.(?) proposed trans-
lated learning which uses a language model to link
the class labels to the features in the source spaces,
which in turn is translated to the features in the
target spaces. Dai et al. (?) further proposed us-
ing spectral learning theory to learn an eigen fea-
ture representation from a task graph representing
features, instances and class labels. In a similar
vein, Pan et al. (?) proposed the spectral feature
alignment (SFA) algorithm where some domain-
independent words are used as a bridge to con-
struct a bipartite graph to model the co-occurrence
relationship between domain-specific words and
domain-independent words. Feature clusters are

124



generated by co-align domain-specific and domain-
independent words.

Graph-based approach has also been studied in
(?) where a graph is built with nodes denoting
documents and edges denoting content similarity
between documents. The sentiment score of each
unlabeled documents is recursively calculated until
convergence from its neighbors the actual labels of
source domain documents and pseudo-labels of tar-
get document documents. This approach was later
extended by simultaneously considering relations
between documents and words from both source and
target domains (?).

More recently, Seah et al. (?) addressed the issue
when the predictive distribution of class label given
input data of the domains differs and proposed Pre-
dictive Distribution Matching SVM learn a robust
classifier in the target domain by leveraging the la-
beled data from only the relevant regions of multiple
sources.

3 Joint Sentiment-Topic (JST) Model
Assume that we have a corpus with a collection ofD
documents denoted by C = {d1, d2, ..., dD}; each
document in the corpus is a sequence of Nd words
denoted by d = (w1, w2, ..., wNd), and each word
in the document is an item from a vocabulary index
with V distinct terms denoted by {1, 2, ..., V }. Also,
let S be the number of distinct sentiment labels, and
T be the total number of topics. The generative
process in JST which corresponds to the graphical
model shown in Figure ??(a) is as follows:

• For each document d, choose a distribution
πd ∼ Dir(γ).

• For each sentiment label l under document d,
choose a distribution θd,l ∼ Dir(α).

• For each word wi in document d

– choose a sentiment label li ∼ Mult(πd),
– choose a topic zi ∼ Mult(θd,li),
– choose a word wi from ϕlizi , a Multino-

mial distribution over words conditioned
on topic zi and sentiment label li.

Gibbs sampling was used to estimate the posterior
distribution by sequentially sampling each variable
of interest, zt and lt here, from the distribution over

note a quantity that excludes data from tth position,
the conditional posterior for zt and lt by marginaliz-
ing out the random variables ϕ, θ, and π is

is the number of times words assigned to topic j
and sentiment label k, Nj,k,d is the number of times
a word from document d has been associated with
topic j and sentiment label k, Nk,d is the number of
times sentiment label k has been assigned to some
word tokens in document d, andNd is the total num-
ber of words in the document collection.

In the modified JST model as shown in Fig-
ure ??(b), we add an additional dependency link of
ϕ on the matrix λ of size S×V which we use to en-
code word prior sentiment information into the JST
model. For each word w ∈ {1, ..., V }, if w is found
in the sentiment lexicon, for each l ∈ {1, ..., S}, the
element λlw is updated as follows

tive or negative.
The matrix λ can be considered as a transforma-

tion matrix which modifies the Dirichlet priors β of
size S × T × V , so that the word prior polarity can
be captured. For example, the word “excellent” with
index i in the vocabulary has a positive polarity. The
corresponding row vector in λ is [0, 1, 0] with its el-
ements representing neutral, positive, and negative.
For each topic j, multiplying λli with βlji, only the
value of βlposji is retained, and βlneuji and βlnegji
are set to 0. Thus, the word “excellent” can only
be drawn from the positive topic word distributions
generated from a Dirichlet distribution with param-
eter βlpos .

4 Polarity Words Extracted by JST

The JST model allows clustering different terms
which share similar sentiment. In this section, we
study the polarity-bearing topics extracted by JST.
We combined reviews from the source and target
domains and discarded document labels in both do-
mains. There are a total of six different combi-
nations. We then run JST on the combined data
sets and listed some of the topic words extracted as
shown in Table ??. Words in each cell are grouped
under one topic and the upper half of the table shows
topic words under the positive sentiment label while
the lower half shows topic words under the negative
sentiment label.

We can see that JST appears to better capture sen-
timent association distribution in the source and tar-
get domains. For example, in the DVD+Elec. set,
words from the DVD domain describe a rock con-
cert DVD while words from the Electronics domain
are likely relevant to stereo amplifiers and receivers,

and yet they are grouped under the same topic by the
JST model. Checking the word coverage in each do-
main reveals that for example “bass” seldom appears
in the DVD domain, but appears more often in the
Electronics domain. Likewise, in the Book+Kitch.
set, “stainless” rarely appears in the Book domain
and “interest” does not occur often in the Kitchen
domain and they are grouped under the same topic.
These observations motivate us to explore polarity-
bearing topics extracted by JST for cross-domain
sentiment classification since grouping words from
different domains but bearing similar sentiment has
the effect of overcoming the data distribution differ-
ence of two domains.

5 Domain Adaptation using JST

Given input data x and a class label y, labeled pat-
terns of one domain can be drawn from the joint
distribution P (x, y) = P (y|x)P (x). Domain adap-
tation usually assume that data distribution are dif-
ferent in source and target domains, i.e., Ps(x) 6=
Pt(x). The task of domain adaptation is to predict
the label yti corresponding to x

t
i in the target domain.

We assume that we are given two sets of training
data, Ds and Dt, the source domain and target do-
main data sets, respectively. In the multiclass clas-
sification problem, the source domain data consist
of labeled instances, Ds = {(xsn; ysn) ∈ X × Y :
1 ≤ n ≤ N s}, where X is the input space and Y
is a finite set of class labels. No class label is given
in the target domain, Dt = {xtn ∈ X : 1 ≤ n ≤
N t, N t � N s}. Algorithm ?? shows how to per-
form domain adaptation using the JST model. The
source and target domain data are first merged with
document labels discarded. A JST model is then

126



learned from the merged corpus to generate polarity-
bearing topics for each document. The original doc-
uments in the source domain are augmented with
those polarity-bearing topics as shown in Step 4 of
Algorithm ??, where li zi denotes a combination of
sentiment label li and topic zi for word wi. Finally,
feature selection is performed according to the infor-
mation gain criteria and a classifier is then trained
from the source domain using the new document
representations. The target domain documents are
also encoded in a similar way with polarity-bearing
topics added into their feature representations.

8: Return a classifier, trained on B

As discussed in Section ?? that the JST model di-
rectly models P (l|d), the probability of sentiment
label given document, and hence document polar-
ity can be classified accordingly. Since JST model
learning does not require the availability of docu-
ment labels, it is possible to augment the source do-
main data by adding most confident pseudo-labeled
documents from the target domain by the JST model
as shown in Algorithm ??.

6 Experiments
We evaluate our proposed approach on the two
datasets, the movie review (MR) data and the multi-
domain sentiment (MDS) dataset. The movie re-
view data consist of 1000 positive and 1000 neg-
ative movie reviews drawn from the IMDB movie
archive while the multi-domain sentiment dataset
contains four different types of product reviews ex-
tracted from Amazon.com including Book, DVD,
Electronics and Kitchen appliances. Each category

of product reviews comprises of 1000 positive and
1000 negative reviews and is considered as a do-
main. Preprocessing was performed on both of the
datasets by removing punctuation, numbers, non-
alphabet characters and stopwords. The MPQA sub-
jectivity lexicon is used as a sentiment lexicon in our
experiments.

6.1 Experimental Setup

While the original JST model can produce reason-
able results with a simple symmetric Dirichlet prior,
here we use asymmetric prior α over the topic pro-
portions which is learned directly from data using a
fixed-point iteration method (?).

In our experiment, α was updated every 25 itera-
tions during the Gibbs sampling procedure. In terms
of other priors, we set symmetric prior β = 0.01 and
γ = (0.05×L)/S, where L is the average document
length, and the value of 0.05 on average allocates 5%
of probability mass for mixing.

6.2 Supervised Sentiment Classification

We performed 5-fold cross validation for the per-
formance evaluation of supervised sentiment clas-
sification. Results reported in this section are av-
eraged over 10 such runs. We have tested several
classifiers including Naı̈ve Bayes (NB) and support
vector machines (SVMs) from WEKA5, and maxi-
mum entropy (ME) from MALLET6. All parameters
are set to their default values except the Gaussian

6http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/

127



prior variance is set to 0.1 for the ME model train-
ing. The results show that ME consistently outper-
forms NB and SVM on average. Thus, we only re-
port results from ME trained on document vectors
with each term weighted according to its frequency.

No. of Topics

Movie Review Book DVD Electronics Kitchen

Figure 2: Classification accuracy vs. no. of topics.

The only parameter we need to set is the number
of topics T . It has to be noted that the actual num-
ber of feature clusters is 3 × T . For example, when
T is set to 5, there are 5 topic groups under each
of the positive, negative, or neutral sentiment labels
and hence there are altogether 15 feature clusters.
The generated topics for each document from the
JST model were simply added into its bag-of-words
(BOW) feature representation prior to model train-
ing. Figure ?? shows the classification results on the
five different domains by varying the number of top-
ics from 1 to 200. It can be observed that the best
classification accuracy is obtained when the number
of topics is set to 1 (or 3 feature clusters). Increas-
ing the number of topics results in the decrease of
accuracy though it stabilizes after 15 topics. Never-
theless, when the number of topics is set to 15, us-
ing JST feature augmentation still outperforms ME
without feature augmentation (the baseline model)
in all of the domains. It is worth pointing out that
the JST model with single topic becomes the stan-
dard LDA model with only three sentiment topics.
Nevertheless, we have proposed an effective way to
incorporate domain-independent word polarity prior
information into model learning. As will be shown
later in Table ?? that the JST model with word po-
larity priors incorporated performs significantly bet-
ter than the LDA model without incorporating such
prior information.

For comparison purpose, we also run the LDA
model and augmented the BOW features with the

generated topics in a similar way. The best accu-
racy was obtained when the number of topics is set
to 15 in the LDA model. Table ?? shows the clas-
sification accuracy results with or without feature
augmentation. We have performed significance test
and found that LDA performs statistically signifi-
cant better than Baseline according to a paired t-test
with p < 0.005 for the Kitchen domain and with
p < 0.001 for all the other domains. JST performs
statistically significant better than both Baseline and
LDA with p < 0.001.

We also compare our method with other recently
proposed approaches. Yessenalina et al. (?) ex-
plored different methods to automatically generate
annotator rationales to improve sentiment classifica-
tion accuracy. Our method using JST feature aug-
mentation consistently performs better than their ap-
proach (denoted as [YE10] in Table ??). They fur-
ther proposed a two-level structured model (?) for
document-level sentiment classification. The best
accuracy obtained on the MR data is 93.22% with
the model being initialized with sentence-level hu-
man annotations, which is still worse than ours. Li
et al. (?) adopted a two-stage process by first clas-
sifying sentences as personal views and impersonal
views and then using an ensemble method to per-
form sentiment classification. Their method (de-
noted as [LI10] in Table ??) performs worse than ei-
ther LDA or JST feature augmentation. To the best
of our knowledge, the results achieved using JST
feature augmentation are the state-of-the-art for both
the MR and the MDS datasets.

6.3 Domain Adaptation

We conducted domain adaptation experiments on
the MDS dataset comprising of four different do-
mains, Book (B), DVD (D), Electronics (E), and
Kitchen appliances (K). We randomly split each do-

128



main data into a training set of 1,600 instances and a
test set of 400 instances. A classifier trained on the
training set of one domain is tested on the test set of
a different domain. We preformed 5 random splits
and report the results averaged over 5 such runs.

Comparison with Baseline Models

We compare our proposed approaches with two
baseline models. The first one (denoted as “Base” in
Table ??) is an ME classifier trained without adapta-
tion. LDA results were generated from an ME clas-
sifier trained on document vectors augmented with
topics generated from the LDA model. The number
of topics was set to 15. JST results were obtained
in a similar way except that we used the polarity-
bearing topics generated from the JST model. We
also tested with adding pseudo-labeled examples
from the JST model into the source domain for ME
classifier training (following Algorithm ??), denoted
as “JST-PL” in Table ??. The document sentiment
classification probability threshold τ was set to 0.8.
Finally, we performed feature selection by selecting
the top 2000 features according to the information
gain criteria (“JST-IG”)7.

There are altogether 12 cross-domain sentiment
classification tasks. We showed the adaptation loss
results in Table ?? where the result for each domain
and for each method is averaged over all three pos-
sible adaptation tasks by varying the source domain.
The adaptation loss is calculated with respect to the
in-domain gold standard classification result. For
example, the in-domain goal standard for the Book
domain is 79.96%. For adapting from DVD to Book,
baseline achieves 72.25% and JST gives 76.45%.
The adaptation loss is 7.71 for baseline and 3.51 for
JST.

It can be observed from Table ?? that LDA only
improves slightly compared to the baseline with an
error reduction of 11%. JST further reduces the er-
ror due to transfer by 27%. Adding pseudo-labeled
examples gives a slightly better performance com-
pared to JST with an error reduction of 36%. With
feature selection, JST-IG outperforms all the other
approaches with a relative error reduction of 53%.

7Both values of 0.8 and 2000 were set arbitrarily after an ini-
tial run on some held-out data; they were not tuned to optimize
test performance.

Parameter Sensitivity

There is only one parameters to be set in the JST-
IG approach, the number of topics. We plot the clas-
sification accuracy versus different topic numbers in
Figure ?? with the number of topics varying between
1 and 200, corresponding to feature clusters varying
between 3 and 600. It can be observed that for the
relatively larger Book and DVD data sets, the accu-
racies peaked at topic number 10, whereas for the
relatively smaller Electronics and Kitchen data sets,
the best performance was obtained at topic number
50. Increasing topic numbers results in the decrease
of classification accuracy. Manually examining the
extracted polarity topics from JST reveals that when
the topic number is small, each topic cluster contains
well-mixed words from different domains. How-
ever, when the topic number is large, words under
each topic cluster tend to be dominated by a single
domain.

Comparison with Existing Approaches

We compare in Figure ?? our proposed approach
with two other domain adaptation algorithms for
sentiment classification, SCL and SFA. Each set of
bars represent a cross-domain sentiment classifica-
tion task. The thick horizontal lines are in-domain
sentiment classification accuracies. It is worth not-
ing that our in-domain results are slightly different
from those reported in (?; ?) due to different ran-
dom splits. Our proposed JST-IG approach outper-
forms SCL in average and achieves comparable re-
sults to SFA. While SCL requires the construction of
a reasonable number of auxiliary tasks that are use-
ful to model “pivots” and “non-pivots”, SFA relies
on a good selection of domain-independent features
for the construction of bipartite feature graph before
running spectral clustering to derive feature clusters.

On the contrary, our proposed approach based on
the JST model is much simpler and yet still achieves
comparable results.

7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have studied polarity-bearing top-
ics generated from the JST model and shown that by
augmenting the original feature space with polarity-
bearing topics, the in-domain supervised classi-
fiers learned from augmented feature representation
achieve the state-of-the-art performance on both the
movie review data and the multi-domain sentiment
dataset. Furthermore, using feature augmentation
and selection according to the information gain cri-
teria for cross-domain sentiment classification, our
proposed approach outperforms SCL and gives sim-
ilar results as SFA. Nevertheless, our approach is
much simpler and does not require difficult parame-
ter tuning.

There are several directions we would like to ex-
plore in the future. First, polarity-bearing topics
generated by the JST model were simply added into
the original feature space of documents, it is worth
investigating attaching different weight to each topic

maybe in proportional to the posterior probability of
sentiment label and topic given a word estimated by
the JST model. Second, it might be interesting to
study the effect of introducing a tradeoff parameter
to balance the effect of original and new features.
Finally, our experimental results show that adding
pseudo-labeled examples by the JST model does not
appear to be effective. We could possibly explore in-
stance weight strategies (?) on both pseudo-labeled
examples and source domain training examples in
order to improve the adaptation performance.
