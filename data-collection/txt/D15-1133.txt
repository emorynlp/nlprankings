Abstract

The widespread use of deception in online
sources has motivated the need for meth-
ods to automatically profile and identify
deceivers. This work explores deception,
gender and age detection in short texts us-
ing a machine learning approach. First,
we collect a new open domain deception
dataset also containing demographic data
such as gender and age. Second, we ex-
tract feature sets including n-grams, shal-
low and deep syntactic features, seman-
tic features, and syntactic complexity and
readability metrics. Third, we build clas-
sifiers that aim to predict deception, gen-
der, and age. Our findings show that while
deception detection can be performed in
short texts even in the absence of a pre-
determined domain, gender and age pre-
diction in deceptive texts is a challenging
task. We further explore the linguistic dif-
ferences in deceptive content that relate
to deceivers gender and age and find evi-
dence that both age and gender play an im-
portant role in people’s word choices when
fabricating lies.

1 Introduction

Given the potential ethical and security risks as-
sociated with deceitful interactions, it is important
to build computational tools able not only to detect
deceivers but also to provide insights into the na-
ture of deceptive behaviors. In particular, informa-
tion related to the demographics of the deceivers
could be potentially useful, as recent studies have
shown that online users lie frequently about their
appearance, gender, age or even education level.

There are multiple scenarios where it would
be desirable to identify deceivers’ demographics;

for instance, identifying the age and gender of
SMS senders or Twitter users might help improve
parental controls, spam filtering, and user’s secu-
rity and privacy.

In this paper, we present a study on deception
detection in an open domain, and also present an
analysis of deceptive behavior in association with
gender and age. Unlike previous studies, where
domain-specific conversational transcripts and re-
views have been used, this research targets the
identification of deceit in short texts where domain
and context are not available. We aim to build
deception, age, and gender classifiers using short
texts, and also explore the prediction of gender and
age in deceptive content. Moreover, we present an
analysis of the topics discussed by deceivers given
their age and gender based on the assumption that,
when lying in an open domain setting, deceivers
will show natural bias towards specific topics re-
lated to gender and age.

2 Related work

To date, several studies have explored the iden-
tification of deceptive content in a variety of do-
mains, including online dating, forums, social net-
works, and consumer reviews. (Toma and Han-
cock, 2010) conducted linguistic analyses in on-
line dating profiles and identified correlations be-
tween deceptive profiles and self references, nega-
tions, and lower levels of words usage. A study
for deception detection on essays and product re-
views is presented in (Feng et al., 2012). (Ott
et al., 2011) addressed the identification of spam
in consumer reviews and also studied the human
capability of detecting deceptive reviews, which
was found not better than chance. In a follow-
ing study, (Ott et al., 2013) presented an analy-
sis of the sentiment associated to deceitful reviews
focusing particularly in those containing negative

1120



sentiment as it largely affects consumer purchase
decisions. More recently (Yu et al., 2015) pre-
sented a study where authors analyze the role of
deception in online networks by detecting decep-
tive groups in a social elimination-game.

This previous work has shown the effectiveness
of features derived from text analysis, which fre-
quently includes basic linguistic representations
such as n-grams and sentence counts statistics
(Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Ott et al., 2011)
and also more complex linguistic features derived
from syntactic context free grammar trees and part
of speech tags (Feng et al., 2012; Xu and Zhao,
2012). Other studies have focused on deception
clues inspired from psychological studies. For
instance, following the hypothesis that deceivers
might create less complex sentences (DePaulo et
al., 2003), researchers have incorporated syntactic
complexity measures into the analysis. (Yancheva
and Rudzicz, 2013) presented a study based on the
analysis of syntactic units and found that syntac-
tic complexity correlates with deceiver’s age. Psy-
cholinguistics lexicons, such as Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker and Fran-
cis, 1999), have also been used to build deception
models using machine learning approaches (Mi-
halcea and Strapparava, 2009; Almela et al., 2012)
and showed that the use of semantic information is
helpful for the automatic identification of deceit.

While there is a significant body of work
on computational deception detection, except for
(Yancheva and Rudzicz, 2013) who considered
the relation between syntactic constructs and de-
ceivers’ age, to our knowledge there are no com-
putational analyses of demographics in deceptive
content. However, there have been a number of
psychological studies on the role of gender and
age in deceptive behavior. These studies have
found interesting associations between deception
and gender. For instance, (Toma et al., 2008) iden-
tified differences in self-presentation among gen-
ders. In this study men were found to lie more
about their height and women lied more about
their weight. (Kaina et al., 2011) found that fe-
males are more easily detectable when lying than
their male counterparts. (Tilley et al., 2005) re-
ported that females are more successful in decep-
tion detection than male receivers.

3 Open Domain Deception Dataset

We started our study by collecting a new open do-
main deception dataset consisting of freely con-
tributed truths and lies. We used Amazon Me-
chanical Turk and asked each worker to contribute
seven lies and seven truths, on topics of their own
choice, each of them consisting of one single sen-
tence. In an attempt to obtain truths and lies that
represent everyday lying behavior, we asked our
contributors to provide plausible lies and avoid
non-commonsensical statements such as “I can
fly.” Since we did not enforce a particular topic,
resulting truths and lies are open domain. Sample
truths and lies are presented in Table 1. Note that
the collected lies might include statements that
are somehow unrealistic, even if plausible, e.g.,
”I own two Ferraris, one red and one black”. We
decided to also include these statements in order
to aid the identification of differences in deceivers
and true-tellers language, as we hypothesize that
they might help reveal topics that naturally occur
in truths and lies.

Additionally, we collect demographic data from
the contributors, including their gender, age, coun-
try of origin, and education level. To avoid spam,
contributions were manually verified by one of the
paper authors. The final dataset consists of 7168
sentences from 512 unique contributors. Since
each contributor provided seven lies and seven
truths the dataset contains a total of 3584 truths
and 3584 lies respectively. Participant’s ages
range from 18 to 72 years, with an average age
of 34.14 and a standard deviation of 12.67.

4 Features

In this section, we describe the sets of features ex-
tracted, which will then be used to build our clas-
sifiers.

Unigrams We extract unigrams derived from the
bag of words representation of truths and lies
present in our dataset.

Shallow and deep syntax features These fea-
tures consist of part of speech (POS) tags
and lexicalized production rules derived
from Probabilistic Context Free Grammar
(PCFG) trees, obtained with the Berkeley
Parser (Petrov et al., 2006).

5 Classification of Deception, Gender,
and Age in Short Texts

Our first experiment seeks to evaluate whether de-
ception detection can be conducted using the open
domain deception dataset described above. We
performed the evaluations at user level, by collaps-
ing all the lies from one user into one instance, and
all the truths into another instance.

We build deception classifiers using the SVM
algorithm1 and the different sets of features. We
performed a five-fold cross-validation, by training
each time on 80% of the users and testing on the
remaining 20%. During our evaluations truths and
lies pertaining to a particular user were either on
the training or testing set. Classification results on
individual and combined sets of features are pre-
sented in Table 3. The best performing set of fea-

tures are the POS tags, followed by features de-
rived from production rules. The remaining sets
of features achieved accuracy values ranging from
54% to 65%, which still represent a noticeable im-
provement over the random baseline. Note that we
experimented with a few more feature sets combi-
nations, including the use of all the features to-
gether, however we did not observe significant im-
provements.

To analyze the impact of the amount of data on
the classifier learning process, we plot the learn-
ing curves on the different sets of features using
incremental amounts of data as shown in Figure 1.
Evaluations were conducted using five-fold cross
validations on each incremental fraction of data.
The learning trend suggests that most classifiers
benefit from increasing amounts of training data.

tion tasks: deception, gender, and age.

However, except for the POS features, the overall
performance seems to stabilize when using 90%
of the training data.

As a second experiment, we evaluate the abil-
ity of the classifier to predict gender and age in
short open domain deceptive texts. Given the con-
tributors’ age distribution, which lies mainly in the
range of 30-45 years, we opted to cluster the par-
ticipants age into into two groups: young ( 35
years) and middle-aged/elder (>35 years). Class
distributions for age and gender are shown in Ta-
ble 2. We performed the age prediction task on
the two groups using the different sets of features
and SVM classifiers. Classification accuracies are
shown in Table 3. Reported baselines consist of
a majority class baseline. Results show low to
moderate improvement over the baseline for gen-
der classification, with the combination of seman-
tic features and unigrams being the best perform-
ing feature set. However, our classifiers performed
poorly in the age prediction task, with accuracies
below the majority class baseline.

Overall, the results suggest that age and gender
prediction are challenging tasks when conducted
in open domain deception data. One possible ex-
planation for this is that the lack of context intro-
duces noise into the analysis. For instance, the fol-
lowing sentence: “I’m 50 years old” can belong to
either a male or a female, and it might be a lie for
younger people or a truth for older people.

6 Analyzing Language Used by
Deceivers Given Age and Gender

In order to explore language differences among
deceivers and true-tellers, we use the linguis-
tic ethnography method (Mihalcea and Pulman,
2009) and obtain the most dominant semantic
word classes in the LIWC lexicon associated to
truth and lies provided by males and females. Re-
sults are shown in Table 4. From this table, we
observe interesting patterns in word usage that
are shared among genders. For instance, spon-
taneous lies often include negation, certain, and
you words, which is in line with previous work on
domain-specific deception (Mihalcea and Strappa-
rava, 2009) that suggested that liars try to rein-
force their lies through the use of stronger word-
ing and detachment from the self. On the other
hand, people appear to be less likely to lie when
talking about their family, religion, and describing
positive experiences. There are also LIWC classes
associated to a specific gender. Male lies contain
references to friends and others, while female lies
contain references to money and future. Similarly,
female true-tellers use metaphor words while male
true-tellers use words related to sports and music.

We also evaluate differences in word usage that
might be attributed to deceiver’s age. Resulting
dominant classes and their scores are presented in
Table 5. The analyses show interesting differences
for deceiver’s word usage across age. For instance,
regardless of their gender, older deceivers use ref-
erences to anxiety, money, and motion. On the
other hand, younger deceivers language includes
anger, negate, and death words. These differences
suggest that indeed gender and age play a role on
people words choices while fabricating lies.

7 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented our initial experiments
in open domain deception detection. We target-
ted the deception detection on short text to address
the cases where context is not available. In real
settings, this can be useful when receiving a text
message or when looking at anonymous posts in
forums. We collected a new deception dataset con-
sisting of one-sentence truths and lies, along with
the demographics of the deceivers. Through sev-
eral experiments, we showed that this data can be
used to build deception classifiers for short open
domain text. However, the classifiers do not per-

form very well while trying to predict gender and
age. We further explored linguistic differences
in deceptive content that relate to deceivers gen-
der and age and found evidence that both age and
gender play an important role on people’s word
choices when fabricating lies.
