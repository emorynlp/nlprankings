Abstract

In this study we investigate using an unsu-
pervised generative learning method for sub-
jectivity detection in text across different do-
mains. We create an initial training set using
simple lexicon information, and then evaluate
a calibrated EM (expectation-maximization)
method to learn from unannotated data. We
evaluate this unsupervised learning approach
on three different domains: movie data, news
resource, and meeting dialogues. We also per-
form a thorough analysis to examine impact-
ing factors on unsupervised learning, such as
the size and self-labeling accuracy of the ini-
tial training set. Our experiments and analysis
show inherent differences across domains and
performance gain from calibration in EM.

1 Introduction
Subjectivity identification is to identify whether an
expression contains opinion or sentiment. Auto-
matic subjectivity identification can benefit many
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. For ex-
ample, information retrieval systems can provide af-
fective or informative articles separately (Pang and
Lee, 2008). Summarization systems may want to
summarize factual and opinionated content differ-
ently (Murray and Carenini, 2008). In this paper,
we perform subjectivity detection at sentence level,
which is more appropriate for some subsequent pro-
cessing such as opinion summarization.

Previous work has shown that when enough la-
beled data is available, supervised classification
methods can achieve high accuracy for subjectivity
detection in some domains. However, it is often ex-
pensive to create such training data. On the other
hand, a lot of unannotated data is readily available
in various domains. Therefore an interesting and
important problem is to develop semi-supervised or
unsupervised learning methods that can learn from
an unannotated corpus. In this study, we use an un-
supervised learning approach where we first use a

knowledge-based method to create an initial train-
ing set, and then apply a calibrated EM method
to learn from an unannotated corpus. Our experi-
ments show significant differences among the three
domains: movie, news article, and meeting dialog.
This can be explained by the inherent difference of
the data, especially the task difficulty and classifier’s
performance for a domain. We demonstrate that for
some domains (e.g., movie data) the unsupervised
learning methods can rival the supervised approach.

2 Related Work

In the early age, knowledge-based methods were
widely used for subjectivity detection. They used
a lexicon or patterns and rules to predict whether a
target is subjective or not. These methods tended
to yield a high precision and low recall, or low
precision and high recall (Kim and Hovy, 2005).
Recently, machine learning approaches have been
adopted more often (Ng et al., 2006). There are
limitations in both methods. In knowledge-based
approaches, a predefined subjectivity lexicon may
not adapt well to different domains. While in ma-
chine learning approach, human labeling efforts are
required to create a large training set.

To overcome the above drawbacks, unsupervised
or semi-supervised methods have been explored in
sentiment analysis. For polarity classification, some
previous work used spectral techniques (Dasgupta
and Ng, 2009) or co-training (Li et al., 2010) to
mine the reviews in a semi-supervised manner. For
subjectivity identification, Wiebe and Riloff (Wiebe
and Riloff, 2005) applied a rule-based method to
create a training set first and then used it to train
a naive Bayes classifier. Melville et al. (Melville
et al., 2009) used a pooling multinomial method to
combine lexicon derived probability and statistical
probability.

Our work is similar to the study in (Wiebe and
Riloff, 2005) in that we both use a rule-based
method to create an initial training set and learn from

161



unannotated corpus. However, there are two key dif-
ferences. First, unlike the self-training method they
used, we use a calibrated EM iterative learning ap-
proach. Second, we compare the results on three dif-
ferent corpora in order to evaluate the domain/genre
effect of the unsupervised method. Our cross-
corpus study shows how the unsupervised learning
approach performs in different domains and helps us
understand what are the factors impacting the learn-
ing methods.

3 Data
We use three data sets from different domains:
movie, news resource, and meeting conversations.
The first two are from written text domain and have
been widely used in many previous studies for sen-
timent analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004; Raaijmakers
and Kraaij, 2008). The third one is from speech
transcripts. It has been used in a few recent stud-
ies (Raaijmakers et al., 2008; Murray and Carenini,
2009), but not as much as those text data. The fol-
lowing provides more details of the data.

• The first corpus is movie data (Pang and Lee,
2004). It contains 5,000 subjective sentences
collected from movie reviews and 5,000 objec-
tive sentences collected from movie plot sum-
maries. The sentences in each collection are
randomly ordered.

• The second one is extracted from MPQA cor-
pus (version 2.0) (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003),
which is collected from news articles. This data
has been annotated with subjective information
at phrase level. We adopted the same rules as in
(Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) to create the sentence
level label: if a sentence has at least one pri-
vate state of strength medium or higher, then
the sentence is labeled SUBJECTIVE, other-
wise it is labeled OBJECTIVE. We randomly
extracted 5,000 subjective and 5,000 objective
sentences from this corpus to make it compara-
ble with the movie data.

• The third data set is from AMI meeting cor-
pus. It has been annotated using the scheme
described in (Wilson, 2008). There are 3 main
categories of annotations regarding sentiments:
subjective utterances, subjective questions, and
objective polar utterances. We consider the

union of subjective utterance and subjective
question as subjective and the rest as objective.
The subjectivity classification task is done at
the dialog act (DA) levels. We label each DA
using the label of the utterance that has over-
lap with it. We create a balanced data set us-
ing this corpus, containing 9,892 DAs in to-
tal. This number is slightly less than those for
movie and MPQA data because of the available
data size in this corpus. The data is also ran-
domly ordered without considering the role of
the speaker and which meeting it belongs to.

Table 1 summarizes statistics for the three data
sets. We can see that sentences in meeting dialogs
(AMI data) are generally shorter than the other do-
mains, and that sentences in news domain (MPQA)
are longer, and also have a larger variance. In ad-
dition, the inter-annotator agreement on AMI data
is quite low, which shows it is even difficult for hu-
man to determine whether an utterance contains sen-
timent in meeting conversations.

4 Unsupervised Subjectivity Detection
In this section, we describe our unsupervised learn-
ing process that uses a knowledge-based method to
create an initial training set, and then uses a cali-
brated EM approach to incorporate unannotated data
into the learning process. We use a naive Bayes clas-
sifier as the base supervised classifier with a bag-of-
words model.

4.1 Create Initial Training Set

A lexicon-based method is used to create an initial
training set, since it can often achieve high precision
rate (though low recall) for subjectivity detection.
We use a subjectivity lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005)
to calculate the subjectivity score for each sentence.

162



This lexicon contains 8,221 entries that are catego-
rized into strong and weak subjective clues.

For each word w, we assign a subjectivity score
sub(w): 1 to strong subjective clues, 0.5 to weak
clues, and 0 for any other word. Then the subjec-
tivity score of a sentence is the sum of the values of
all the words in the sentence, normalized by the sen-
tence length. We noticed that for sentences labeled
as SUBJECTIVE in the three corpora, the subjective
clues appear more frequently in movie data than the
other two corpora. Thus we perform different nor-
malization for the three data sets to obtain the sub-
jectivity score for each sentence, sub(s): Equation
1 for the movie data, and Equation 2 for MPQA and
AMI data.

sub(s) =
∑
w∈s

sub(w)/sent length (1)

sub(s) =
∑
w∈s

sub(w)/log(sent length) (2)

We label the topm sentences with the highest sub-
jective scores as SUBJECTIVE, and label m sen-
tences with the lowest scores as OBJECTIVE. These
2m sentences form the initial training set for the it-
erative learning methods.

4.2 Calibrated EM Naive Bayes

Expectation-Maximization (EM) naive Bayes
method is a semi-supervised algorithm proposed in
(Nigam et al., 2000) for learning from both labeled
and unlabeled data. In the implementation of EM,
we iterate the E-step and M-step until model param-
eters converge or a predefined iteration number is
reached. In E-step, we use naive Bayes classifier to
estimate the posterior probabilities of each sentence
si belonging to each class cj (SUBJECTIVE and
OBJECTIVE), P (cj |si):

P (cj |si) =
P (cj)

∏|si|
k=1 P (wk|cj)∑

cl∈C P (cl)
∏|si|

k=1 P (wk|cl)
(3)

The M-step uses the probabilistic results from
the E-step to recalculate the parameters in the naive
Bayes classifier, the probability of word wt in class
cj and the prior probability of class cj :

P (wt|cj) =
0.1 +

∑
si∈S N(wt, si)P (cj |si)

0.1× |V |+
∑|V |

k=1

∑
si∈S N(wk, si)P (cj |si)

(4)

P (cj) =
0.1 +

∑
si∈S P (cj |si)

0.1× |C|+ |S|
(5)

S is the set of sentences. N(wt, si) is the count of
word wt in a sentence si. We use additive smooth-
ing with α = 0.1 for probability parameter estima-
tion. |C| is the number of classes, which is 2 in our
case, and |V| is the vocabulary size, obtained from
the entire data set.

In the first iteration, we assign P (cj |si) using the
pseudo training data generated based on lexicon in-
formation. If a sentence is labeled SUBJECTIVE,
then P (sub|si) is 1 and P (obj|si) is 0; for the sen-
tences with OBJECTIVE labels, P (sub|si) is 0 and
P (obj|si) is 1.

In our work, we use a variant of standard EM:
calibrated EM, introduced by (Tsuruoka and Tsujii,
2003). The basic idea of this approach is to shift
the probability values of unlabeled data to the ex-
tent such that the class distribution of unlabeled data
is identical to the distribution in labeled data (bal-
anced class in our case). In our approach, before
model training (“M-step”) in each iteration, we ad-
just the posterior probability of each sentence in the
following steps:

• Transform the posterior probabilities through
the inverse function of the sigmoid function.
The outputs are real values.

• Sort them and use the median of all the values
as the border value. This is because our data is
balanced.

• Subtract this border value from the transformed
values.

• Transform the new values back into probability
values using a sigmoid function.

Note that there is a caveat here. We are assum-
ing we know the class distribution, based on labeled
training data or human knowledge. This is often a
reasonable assumption. In addition, we are assum-
ing that this class distribution is the same for the
unlabeled data. If this is not true, then the distri-
bution adjustment performed in calibrated EM may
hurt system performance.

5 Empirical Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate our unsupervised learn-
ing method and analyze various impacting factors.

163



In preprocessing, we removed the punctuation and
numbers from the data and performed word stem-
ming. To measure performance, we use classifica-
tion accuracy.

5.1 Unsupervised Learning Results

In experiments of unsupervised learning, we per-
form 5-fold cross validation. We divide the cor-
pus into 5 parts with equal size (each with balanced
class distribution). In each run we reserve one part
as the test set. From the remaining data, we use
the lexicon-based method to create the initial train-
ing data, containing 1,000 SUBJECTIVE and 1,000
OBJECTIVE sentences. The rest is used as unla-
beled data to perform iterative learning. The final
model is then applied to the reserved test set. Fig-
ure 1 shows the learning curves of calibrated EM on
movie, MPQA and AMI data respectively.

Figure 1: Calibrated EM results using unsupervised setting
(2,000 self-labeled initial samples) on movie, MPQA, and AMI
data.

On movie data, calibrated EM improves the per-
formance significantly (p<0.005), compared to that
based on the initial training set (iteration 0). It takes
only a few iterations for the EM method to converge
and at the end of the iteration, it achieves 90.15%
accuracy, which rivals the fully supervised learn-
ing performance (91.31% when using all the 8,000
labeled sentences for training). On MPQA data,
this method yields some improvement (p<0.1) com-
pared to the initial point. But there is a peak accu-
racy in the first couple of iterations, and then perfor-
mance starts dropping thereafter. On AMI data, the
performance degrades after the first iteration.

5.2 Analysis and Discussion

5.2.1 Effect of initial set

For unsupervised learning, our first question is
how the accuracy and size of the initial training set
affect performance. We calculate the self-labeling
accuracy for the initial set using the lexicon based
method. Table 2 shows the labeling accuracy when
using different initial size, measured for SUBJEC-
TIVE and OBJECTIVE class separately. In addi-
tion, we present the classification performance on
the test set when using the naive Bayes classifier
trained from the initial set. Each size in the table
represents the total number of sentences in the ini-
tial set.

Table 2 shows that when the size is 2,000 (as we
used in previous experiments), the accuracy for both
classes on MPQA are even better than on movies,
even though we have seen that iterative learning
methods perform much better on movies, suggest-
ing that the initial data set accuracy is not the reason
for the worse performance on MPQA than movies.
It also shows that on movie data, as the initial size
increases, the accuracy of the pseudo training set de-
creases, which is as expected (the top ranked self-
labeled samples are more confident and accurate).
However, this is not the case on MPQA and AMI
data. There is no obvious drop of accuracy, rather in
many cases accuracy even increases when the initial
size increases. It shows that on these two corpora,
our lexicon-based method does not perform very
well because the most highly ranked sentences ac-
cording to the subjective lexicon are not those most
subjective sentences.

Table 2: Initial pseudo training accuracy for SUBJECTIVE
(sub) and OBJECTIVE (obj) class, and performance on the test
using this initial training set (Acc Test). Results (all in %) are
shown for different initial data size.

From the results on the test set, we find that when
164



the size is smaller, such as containing 100 or 200
samples, the accuracy on test set is lower than using
a bigger initial set. This is mainly because there is
not sufficient data for model training. For AMI data,
this is also due to the low accuracy in the training set.
When the initial size is large enough, the improve-
ment from a larger training set is not as substantial,
for example, using 1,000, 2,000, or 3,000 sentences.
On AMI data, there is almost no difference among
the three sets. There is a tradeoff between the two
factors, self-labeling accuracy and the data size. Of-
ten an improvement in one aspect causes degrada-
tion of the other. A reasonable starting point needs
to be chosen considering both factors. Overall, it
shows that the performance on test set can benefit
more from using a larger initial training set, though
it may be noisy.

In order to further investigate the impact of self-
labeled initial data set, we perform standard semi-
supervised learning using reference labels in the
initial data set. The learning curve of this semi-
supervised setting is shown in Figure 2.

AMI

Figure 2: Calibrated EM results using semi-supervised learn-
ing (2,000 labeled seed) on movie, MPQA, and AMI data.

On movie data, calibrated EM yields better per-
formance over that based on the initial training data
(iteration 0). We can see that calibrated EM con-
verges very fast and achieves very high performance
in the first iteration. On MPQA and AMI data, cali-
brated EM increases the accuracy at the first iteration
but then degrades thereafter. This shows that incor-
porating unlabeled data in training is helpful, how-
ever, more EM iterations do not yield further gain.

We noticed that on AMI data, even when the ini-
tial set has 100% accuracy (i.e., semi-supervised set-
ting), it still fails to yield any performance gain on

AMI data. It shows that the low accuracy of initial
training set does not explain the poor performance
of unsupervised learning method. Therefore, we
conducted another set of experiments which use the
same semi-supervised setting but start from different
initial training sizes. We observed that on MPQA
and AMI data, calibrated EM is able to increase the
accuracy only when the initial training set is small
(less than 100 instances) and the performance at the
start point is poor. We believe this is related to the
data property and the assumptions used in EM. Sim-
ilar patterns have been found in some previous stud-
ies (Chapelle et al., 2006). They attribute this to the
incorrect model assumption, i.e., when the modeling
assumptions for a particular classifier do not match
the characteristics of the distribution of the data, un-
labeled data may degrade the performance of classi-
fiers.

5.2.2 Effect of calibration

Figure 3 compares calibrated EM with standard
EM using unsupervised learning on the three do-
mains. We can see that calibrated EM outperforms
standard EM, with a larger improvement on MPQA
and AMI data. When using standard EM, we find
that there is a larger difference between the number
of instances in the two classes based on the model’s
prediction on MPQA and AMI data than movie data.
For example, in one run using EM, in the first iter-
ation the ratio of the two classes is 2.21, 1.88, and
1.23 for MPQA, AMI, and movie data respectively.
Calibrated EM is more effective on the two domains
because it adjusts the posterior probability of each
sample according to the class distribution in the data,
making it more accurate in training the model in the
next iteration.

5.2.3 Error analysis

There are two points worth discussing based on
our error analysis.

A. Domain difference.

Much of the difference we have observed can be
attributed to the genre difference. In movie reviews,
often a person expresses his/her favor (or not) of the
movie explicitly, making the task relatively easy for
automatic subjectivity classification. MPQA data
is collected from news resource, where subjectiv-
ity mostly means an attitude or a judgment. Take

the following sentence as an example: “The United
States is prepared to fight terrorism alone”. It is la-
beled as SUBJECTIVE because it expresses a deter-
mination. However, it may also be interpreted as an
objective statement.

The AMI corpus consists of meeting conversa-
tions. The free-style dialogues are very different
from the style in review and news articles. There are
many incomplete sentences and disfluencies. More
importantly, the meaning of a sentence is often con-
text dependent. In the examples shown below, the
two sentences look very similar, however, the first
sentence is labeled as “OBJECTIVE”, and the sec-
ond one as “SUBJECTIVE”. This is because of the
different context and speaker information – the sec-
ond sentence expresses agreement, but the first ex-
ample is just a sequence of discourse marker words.
• Alright yeah okay
• Yeah okay, true, true.

We notice that many of the classification errors in
AMI occur in very short sentences, like in the ex-
ample shown above. These short sentences are very
ambiguous for subjectivity classification.

B. Limitation of the bag-of-word model.

Our analysis also showed that some sentences are
difficult to classify if simply using surface words. In
the following, we show some examples of system
errors.

False negatives: subjective sentences recognized as
objective
• Johnson has, in his first film, set himself a task he is

not nearly up to. (movie data)

• The news from Israel is almost earth-shattering.
(MPQA)

• We can stick with what we already get. (AMI)

False positives: objective sentences recognized as
subjective
• Cathy (Julianne Moore) is the perfect 50s house-

wife, living the perfect 50s life: healthy kids, suc-
cessful husband, social prominence. (movie data)

• The committee Wednesday opened a formal de-
bate on human rights questions, including alterna-
tive approaches for improving the effective enjoy-
ment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
(MPQA)

• um uh you know apple been really successful with
this surgical white kind of business or this sleek
kind of (AMI)

In the first three examples, there are no explicit
subjective clues, resulting in false negative errors.
The subjective word “earth-shattering” is not in-
cluded in subjective lexicon and rarely used in the
corpus. The last three examples contain several sub-
jective words, and are therefore labeled as subjec-
tive. These are the problems with the current word
based approaches.

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper investigates an unsupervised learning
procedure for subjectivity identification at sentence
level. We use a lexicon-based method to create ini-
tial training data and then apply a calibrated EM to
utilize unlabeled corpus. We evaluate this method
across three different data sets and observe signif-
icant difference. It yields good performance on
movie data but does not achieve much performance
gain on MPQA corpus, while on AMI corpus it fails
to yield improvement. Our analysis showed that per-
formance of the base classifier has a substantial im-
pact on iterative learning methods. In addition, we
found that calibrated EM outperforms the standard
EM method when the class distribution based on
classifier’s hypotheses does not match the real one.

Our iterative learning approach uses a naive
Bayes classifier that may not have accurate posterior
probabilities. Therefore in our future work, we will
evaluate using other base models. Our cross-corpus
analysis shows poor performance of subjectivity de-
tection in AMI data. We plan to explore more in-
formation from multiparty dialogs to help improve
performance for that domain.
