Abstract

This paper describes an annotated gold stan-
dard sample corpus of Early Modern German
containing over 50,000 tokens of text manu-
ally annotated with POS tags, lemmas, and
normalised spelling variants. The corpus is
the first resource of its kind for this variant of
German, and represents an ideal test bed for
evaluating and adapting existing NLP tools on
historical data. We describe the corpus for-
mat, annotation levels, and challenges, provid-
ing an example of the requirements and needs
of smaller humanities-based corpus projects.

1 Introduction

This paper describes work which is part of a larger
project whose goal is to develop a representative cor-
pus of Early Modern German from 1650-1800. The
GerManC corpus was born out of the need for a re-
source to facilitate comparative studies of the devel-
opment and standardisation of English and German
in the 17th and 18th centuries. One major goal is
to annotate GerManC with linguistic information in
terms of POS tags, lemmas, and normalised spelling
variants. However, due to the lexical, morpholog-
ical, syntactic, and graphemic peculiarities charac-
teristic of Early Modern German, automatic annota-
tion of the texts poses a major challenge. Most ex-
isting NLP tools are tuned to perform well on mod-
ern language data, but perform considerably worse
on historical, non-standardised data (Rayson et al.,
2007). This paper describes a gold standard sub-
corpus of GerManC which has been manually anno-
tated by two human annotators for POS tags, lem-

mas, and normalised spelling variants. The corpus
will be used to test and adapt modern NLP tools on
historical data, and will be of interest to other current
corpus-based projects in historical linguistics (Jur-
ish, 2010; Fasshauer, 2011; Dipper, 2010).

2 Corpus design

2.1 GerManC
In order to enable corpus-linguistic investigations,
the GerManC corpus aims to be representative on
three different levels. First of all, the corpus includes
a range of text types: four orally-oriented genres
(dramas, newspapers, letters, and sermons), and four
print-oriented ones (narrative prose, and humanities,
scientific, and legal texts). Secondly, in order to en-
able historical developments to be traced, the pe-
riod has been divided into three fifty year sections
(1650-1700, 1700-1750, and 1750-1800). The com-
bination of historical and text-type coverage should
enable research on the evolution of style in differ-
ent genres (cf. Biber and Finegan, 1989). Finally,
the corpus also aims to be representative with re-
spect to region, including five broad dialect areas:
North German, West Central, East Central, West Up-
per (including Switzerland), and East Upper German
(including Austria). Per genre, period, and region,
three extracts of around 2000 words are selected,
yielding a corpus size of nearly a million words. The
structure of the GerManC corpus is summarised in
Table 1.

Table 1: Structure of the GerManC corpus

ManC corpus aims to provide the following linguis-
tic annotations: 1.) Normalised spelling variants;
2.) Lemmas; 3.) POS tags. However, due to the
non-standard nature of written Early Modern Ger-
man, and the additional variation introduced by the
three variables of ‘genre’, ‘region’, and ‘time’, au-
tomatic annotation of the corpus poses a major chal-
lenge. In order to assess the suitability of existing
NLP tools on historical data, and with a view to
adapting them to improve their performance, a man-
ually annotated gold standard subcorpus has been
developed, which aims to be as representative of
the main corpus as possible (GerManC-GS). To re-
main manageable in terms of annotation times and
cost, the subcorpus considers only two of the three
corpus variables, ‘genre’ and ‘time’, as they alone
were found to display as much if not more varia-
tion than ‘region’. GerManC-GS thus only includes
texts from the North German dialect region, with
one sample file per genre and time period. Table
2 provides an overview of GerManC-GS, showing
publication year, file name, and number of tokens for
each genre/period combination. It contains 57,845
tokens in total, which have been manually annotated
as described in the following sections.

2.3 Corpus format
As transcription of historical texts needs to be very
detailed with regard to document structure, glossing,
damaged or illegible passages, foreign language ma-
terial and special characters such as diacritics and
ligatures, the raw input texts have been annotated
according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI)1 during manual transcription. The
TEI have published a set of XML-based encoding
conventions recommended for meta-textual markup

1http://www.tei-c.org

to minimise inconsistencies across projects and to
maximise mutual usability and data interchange.

The GerManC corpus has been marked up using
the TEI P5 Lite tagset, which serves as standard for
many humanities-based projects. Only the most rel-
evant tags have been selected to keep the document
structure as straightforward as possible. Figure 1
shows structural annotation of a drama excerpt, in-
cluding headers, stage directions, speakers, as well
as lines.

3 Linguistic annotation

GerManC-GS has been annotated with linguistic in-
formation in terms of normalised word forms, lem-
mas, and POS tags. To reduce manual labour, a
semi-automatic approach was chosen whose output
was manually corrected by two trained annotators.
The following paragraphs provide an overview of
the annotation types and the main challenges en-
countered during annotation.

3.1 Tokenisation and sentence boundaries

As German orthography was not yet codified in the
Early Modern period, word boundaries were diffi-
cult to determine at times. Clitics and multi-word
tokens are particularly difficult issues: lack of stan-
dardisation means that clitics can occur in various
different forms, some of which are difficult to to-
kenise (e.g. wirstu instead of wirst du). Multi-word
tokens, on the other hand, represent a problem as the
same expression may be sometimes treated as com-
pound (e.g. obgleich), but written separately at other
times (ob gleich). Our tokenisation scheme takes cl-
itics into account, but does not yet deal with multi-
word tokens. This means that whitespace characters
usually act as token boundaries.

Table 2: GerManC-GS design

Annotation of sentence boundaries is also affected
by the non-standard nature of the data. Punctuation
is not standardised in Early Modern German and
varies considerably across the corpus. For example,
the virgule symbol “/” was often used in place of
both comma and full-stop, which proves problem-
atic for sentence boundary detection.

3.2 Normalising spelling variants and
lemmatisation

One of the key challenges in working with histor-
ical texts is the large amount of spelling variation
they contain. As most existing NLP tools (such as
POS-taggers or parsers) are tuned to perform well
on modern language data, they are not usually able
to account for variable spelling, resulting in lower
overall performance (Rayson et al., 2007). Like-
wise, modern search engines do not take spelling
variation into account and are thus often unable to
retrieve all occurrences of a given historical search
word. Both issues have been addressed in previ-
ous work through the task of spelling normalisa-
tion. Ernst-Gerlach and Fuhr (2006) and Pilz and
Luther (2009) have created a tool that can gener-
ate variant spellings for historical German to retrieve
relevant instances of a given modern lemma, while
Baron and Rayson (2008) and Jurish (2010) have
implemented tools which normalise spelling vari-
ants in order to achieve better performance of NLP
tools such as POS taggers (by running the tools on
the normalised input). Our annotation of spelling
variants aims to compromise between these two ap-
proaches by allowing for historically accurate lin-

guistic searches, while also aiming to maximise the
performance of automatic annotation tools. We treat
the task of normalising spelling variation as a type
of pre-lemmatisation, where each word token occur-
ring in a text is labelled with a normalised head vari-
ant. As linguistic search requires a historically accu-
rate treatment of spelling variation, our scheme has a
preference for treating two seemingly similar tokens
as separate items on historical grounds (e.g. etwan
vs. etwa). However, the scheme normalises variants
to a modernised form even where the given lexical
item has since died out (e.g. obsolete verbs ending
in -iren are normalised to -ieren), in order to support
automatic tools using morphological strategies such
as suffix probabilities (Schmid, 1994).

Lemmatisation resolves the normalised variant to
a base lexeme in modern form, using Duden2 pre-
reform spelling. With obsolete words, the leading
form in Grimm’s Deutsches Wörterbuch3 is taken.

3.3 POS-Tagging

We introduce a modified version of the STTS tagset
(Schiller et al., 1999), the STTS-EMG tagset, to ac-
count for important differences between modern and
Early Modern German (EMG), and to facilitate more
accurate searches. The tagset merges two categories,
as the criteria for distinguishing them are not appli-
cable in EMG (1.), and provides a number of ad-
ditional ones to account for special EMG construc-
tions (2. to 6.):

1. PIAT (merged with PIDAT): Indefinite deter-
miner (occurring on its own, or in conjunction
with another determiner), as in ’viele solche
Bemerkungen’

2. NA: Adjectives used as nouns, as in ‘der
Gesandte’

3. PAVREL: Pronominal adverb used as relative,
as in ‘die Puppe, damit sie spielt’

4. PTKREL: Indeclinable relative particle, as in
‘die Fälle, so aus Schwachheit entstehen’

5. PWAVREL: Interrogative adverb used as
relative, as in ‘der Zaun, worüber sie springt’

6. PWREL: Interrogative pronoun used as rela-
tive, as in ‘etwas, was er sieht’

Around 2.0% (1132) of all tokens in the corpus
have been tagged with one of the above POS cate-
gories, of which the merged PIAT class contains the
majority (657 tokens). The remaining 475 cases oc-
cur as NA (291), or as one of the new relative mark-
ers PWAVREL (69), PWREL (57), PTKREL (38),
and PAVREL (20).

4 Annotation procedure and agreement

In order to produce the gold standard annotations in
GerManC-GS we used the GATE platform, which
facilitates automatic as well as manual annotation
(Cunningham et al, 2002). Initially, GATE’s Ger-
man Language plugin4 was used to obtain word to-
kens and sentence boundaries. The output was man-
ually inspected and corrected by one annotator, who
manually added a layer of normalised spelling vari-
ants (NORM). This annotation layer was then used
as input for the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), obtain-
ing annotations in terms of lemmas (LEMMA) and
POS tags (POS). All annotations (NORM, LEMMA,
and POS) were subsequently corrected by two an-
notators, and all disagreements were reconciled to
produce the gold standard. Table 3 shows the over-
all agreement for the three annotation types across
GerManC-GS (measured in accuracy).

The agreement values demonstrate that nor-
malised word forms and lemmas are relatively easy
to determine for the annotators, with 96.9% and
95.5% agreement, respectively. POS tags, on the
other, represent more of a challenge with only 91.6%

Table 3: Inter-annotator agreement

agreement between two annotators, which is consid-
erably lower than the agreement level reported for
annotating a corpus of modern German using STTS,
at 98.6% (Brants, 2000a). While a more detailed
analysis of the results remains to be carried out, an
initial study shows that POS agreement is lower in
earlier texts (89.3% in Period P1) compared to later
ones (93.1% in P3). It is likely that a substantial
amount of disagreements in the earlier texts are due
to the larger number of unfamiliar word forms and
variants on the one hand, and foreign word tokens
on the other. These represent a problem as from a
modern view point it is not always easy to decide
which words were ’foreign’ to a language and which
ones ’native’.

5 Future work

The gold standard corpus described in this paper will
be used to test and adapt modern NLP tools on Early
Modern German data. Initial experiments focus on
utilising the layer of normalised spelling variants
to improve tagger performance, and investigating to
what extent normalisation can be reliably automated
(Jurish, 2010). We further plan to retrain state-of-
the-art POS taggers such as the TreeTagger and TnT
Tagger (Brants, 2000b) on our data.

Finally, we plan to investigate how linguistic an-
notations can be automatically integrated in the TEI-
annotated version of the corpus to produce TEI-
conformant output. Currently, both structural and
linguistic annotations are merged in GATE stand-off
XML format, which, as a consequence, is no longer
TEI-conformant. In the interest of interoperability
and comparative studies between corpora we aim to
contribute towards the development of clearer proce-
dures whereby structural and linguistic annotations
might be merged (Scheible et al., 2010).
