Abstract

This paper describes our system for
SemEval-2010 Task 8 on multi-way clas-
sification of semantic relations between
nominals. First, the type of semantic re-
lation is classified. Then a relation type-
specific classifier determines the relation
direction. Classification is performed us-
ing SVM classifiers and a number of fea-
tures that capture the context, semantic
role affiliation, and possible pre-existing
relations of the nominals. This approach
achieved an F1 score of 82.19% and an ac-
curacy of 77.92%.

1 Introduction
SemEval-2010 Task 8 evaluated the multi-way
classification of semantic relations between nom-
inals in a sentence (Hendrickx et al., 2010).
Given two nominals embedded in a sentence,
the task requires identifying which of the fol-
lowing nine semantic relations holds between
the nominals: Cause-Effect, Instrument-Agency,
Product-Producer, Content-Container, Entity-
Origin, Entity-Destination, Component-Whole,
Member-Collection, Message-Topic, or Other if
no other relation is appropriate. For instance, the
following sentence provides an example of the
Entity-Destination relation:
“A small [piece]E1 of rock landed into the
[trunk]E2.”
The two nominals given for this sentence are
E1 (piece) and E2 (trunk). This is an Entity-
Destination relation because the piece of rock
originated from outside of the trunk, but ended
up there. Finally, the direction of the relation is
(E1,E2) because E1, the piece, is the Entity and E2,
the trunk, is the Destination.

Analysis of the training data revealed three ma-
jor classes of knowledge required for recognizing

semantic relations: (i) examples that require back-
ground knowledge of an existing relation between
the nominals (e.g., example 5884 below), (ii) ex-
amples using background knowledge regarding
the typical role of one of the nominals (e.g., ex-
ample 3402), and (iii) examples that require con-
textual cues to disambiguate the role between the
nominals (e.g., example 5710).

Example 5884 “The Ca content in the [corn]E1
[flour]E2 has also a strong dependence on
the pericarp thickness.”

Example 3402 “The [rootball]E1 was in a
[crate]E2 the size of a refrigerator, and some
of the arms were over 12 feet tall.”

Example 5710 “The seniors poured [flour]E1
into wax [paper]E2 and threw the items as
projectiles on freshmen during a morning pep
rally.”

In example 5884, the background knowledge
that flour is often made or derived from corn can
directly lead to the classification of the example
as containing an Entity-Origin relation. Likewise,
knowing that crates often act as containers is a
strong reason for believing that example 3402 is
a Content-Container relation. However, in exam-
ple 5710, neither the combination of the nominals
nor their individual affiliations lead to an obvious
semantic relation. After taking the context into
account, it becomes clear that this is an Entity-
Destination relation because E1 is going into E2.

2 Approach
We cast the task of determining a semantic re-
lation and its direction as a classification task.
Rather than classifying both pieces of informa-
tion (relation and direction) simultaneously, one
classifier is used to determine the relation type,
and then, for each relation type, a separate clas-
sifier determines the direction. We used a total
of 45 feature types (henceforth: features), which

256



were shared among all of the direction classi-
fiers and the one relation classifier. These fea-
ture types can be partitioned into 8 groups: lexical
features, hypernyms from WordNet1, dependency
parse, PropBank parse, FrameNet parse, nominal-
ization, predicates from TextRunner, and nomi-
nal similarity derived from the Google N-Gram
data set. All features were treated as FEATURE-
TYPE:VALUE pairs which were then presented to
the SVM2 classifier as a boolean feature (0 or 1).

We further group our features into the three
classes described above: Contextual, Nominal af-
filiation, and Pre-existing relations. Table 1 illus-
trates sample feature values from example 117 of
the training set.

3 Contextual and Lexical Features
The contextual features consist of lexical features
and features based on dependency, PropBank, and
FrameNet parses. For lexical features, we extract
the words and parts of speech for E1 and E2, the
words, parts of speech, and prefixes of length 5 for
tokens between the nominals, and the words be-
fore and single word after E1 and E2 respectively.
The words between the nominals can be strong
indicators for the type of relation. For example
the words into, produced, and caused are likely
to occur in Entity-Destination, Product-Producer,
and Cause-Effect relations, respectively. Using
the prefixes of length 5 for the words between the
nominals provides a kind of stemming (produced
→ produ, caused → cause).

Inspired by a feature from (Beamer et al., 2007),
we extract a coarse-grained part of speech se-
quence for the words between the nominals. This
is accomplished by building a string using the first
letter of each token’s Treebank POS tag. This fea-
ture is motivated by the fact that relations such as
Member-Collection usually invoke prepositional
phrases such as: of, in the, and of various. The
corresponding POS sequences we extract are: “I”,
“I D”, and “I J”. Finally, we also use the num-
ber of words between the nominals as a feature
because relations such as Product-Producer and
Entity-Origin often have no intervening tokens
(e.g., organ builder or Coconut oil).

Syntactic and semantic parses capture long dis-
tance relationships between phrases in a sentence.
Instead of a traditional syntactic parser, we chose

1http://wordnet.princeton.edu/
2We used Weka’s SMO classifier

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/

the Stanford dependency parser3 for the simpler
syntactic structure it produces. Our dependency
features are based on paths in the dependency tree
of length 1 and length 2. The paths encode the de-
pendencies and words those dependencies attach
to. To generalize the paths, some of the features
replace verbs in the path with their top-level Levin
class, as determined by running a word sense dis-
ambiguation system (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005)
followed by a lookup in VerbNet4. One of the fea-
tures for length 2 paths generalizes further by re-
placing all words with their location relative to the
nominals, either BEFORE, BETWEEN, or AFTER.

Consider example 117 from Table 1. The length
2 dependency path (feature depPathLen2VerbNet)
neatly captures the fact that E1 is the subject of a
verb falling into Levin class 27, and E2 is the di-
rect object. Levin class 27 is the class of engender
verbs, such as cause, spawn, and generate. This
path is indicative of a Cause-Effect relation.

Semantic parses such as ASSERT’s PropBank
parse5 and LTH’s FrameNet parse6 identify predi-
cates in text and their semantic roles. These parses
go beyond the dependency parse and identify the
specific role each nominal assumes for the pred-
icates in the sentence, so the parses should be a
more reliable indicator for the relation type be-
tween nominals. We have features for the iden-
tified predicates and for the roles assigned to each
nominal. Several of the features are only triggered
if both nominals are arguments for the same pred-
icate. The values from Table 1 show that the fea-
tures correctly determined that E1 and E2 are gov-
erned by a verb of Levin class 27, and that the lex-
ical unit is cause.v.

4 Nominal Role Affiliation Features
Although context can be critical to identifying the
semantic relation present in some examples, in
others we must bring some background knowledge
to bear regarding the types of nominals involved.
Knowing that a writer is a person provides sup-
porting evidence for that nominal taking part in
a PRODUCER role. Additionally, writer nominal-
izes the verb write which is classified by Levin
(Levin, 1993) as an “Image creation” or “Creation
and Transformation” verb. This provides further
support for assigning writer to a PRODUCER role.

Table 1: All of the feature types and values for example 117 from the training data. Despite the errors in
disambiguation the system still correctly classifies this as Cause-Effect(E1,E2)

We capture this background knowledge by lever-
aging four sources of lexical and semantic knowl-
edge: WordNet, NomLex-Plus7, VerbNet, and the
Google N-Gram data8.

We utilize a word sense disambiguation sys-
tem (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005) to determine the
best sense for each nominal and use all of the hy-
pernyms as a feature. Hypernyms are also deter-
mined for the words between the nominals, how-
ever only the top three levels are used as a feature.
Following (Beamer et al., 2007), we also incor-
porate a nominalization feature for each nominal
based on NomLex-Plus. Rather than use the agen-
tial information as they did, we determine the verb
being nominalized and retrieve the verb’s top-level
Levin class from VerbNet. This reduces the spar-
sity problem for nominalizations while still cap-
turing their semantics.

Our final role-affiliation features make use of
the Google N-Gram data. Using the 5-grams we
determined the top 1,000 words that occur most
often in the context of each nominal. Nominals
were then compared to each other using Jaccard
similarity of their contexts and the 4 closest neigh-
bors were retained. For each nominal, we have a
feature containing the nominal itself and its 4 near-
est neighbors from the training set. Additional fea-
tures determine the most frequent role assigned to
the neighbors. Examples of all these features can

be seen in Table 1 in the row for NGrams. The
neighbors for motion in the table show the diffi-
culty this feature has with ambiguity, incorrectly
picking up words similar to the sense meaning a
proposal for action.

5 Pre-existing Relation Features

For some examples the context and the individ-
ual nominal affiliations provide little help in de-
termining the semantic relation, such as example
5884 from before (i.e., corn flour). These ex-
amples require knowledge of the interaction be-
tween the nominals and we cannot rely solely
on determining the role of one nominal or the
other. We turned to TextRunner (Yates et al.,
2007) as a large source of background knowl-
edge about pre-existing relations between nom-
inals. TextRunner is a queryable database of
NOUN-VERB-NOUN triples extracted from a large
corpus of webpages. For example, the phrases re-
trieved from TextRunner for “corn flour”
include: “is ground into”, “to make”, “to ob-
tain”, and “makes”. Querying in the reverse direc-
tion, for “flour corn” returns phrases such
as: “contain”, “filled with”, “comprises”, and “is
made from”. We use the top ten phrases for the
“<E1> <E2>” query results, and also for
the “<E2> <E1>” results, forming two fea-
tures. In addition, we include a feature that has all
of the hypernyms for the content words in the verb
phrases from the queries for the E1-E2 direction.

6 Results
Our system achieved the best overall score as mea-
sured by macro-averaged F1 (for scoring details
see (Hendrickx et al., 2010)) among the ten teams
that participated in the semantic relation task at
SemEval-2010. The results in Table 2 show the
performance of the system on the test set for each
relation type and the overall score.

The training data consisted of 8,000 annotated
instances, including the numbered examples intro-
duced earlier, and the test set contained 2,717 ex-
amples. To assess the learning curve for this task
we trained on sets of size 1000, 2000, 4000, and
8000, obtaining test scores of 73.08, 77.02, 79.93,
and 82.19, respectively. These results indicate that
more training data does help, but going from 1,000
training instances to 8,000 only boosts the score by
about 9 points of F-measure.

Because our approach makes use of many dif-
ferent features, we ran ablation tests on the 8 sets
of features from Table 1 to determine which types
of features contributed the most to classifying se-
mantic relations. We evaluated all 256 (28) combi-
nations of the feature sets on the training data us-
ing 10-fold cross validation. The results are shown
in Table 3. The last lines of Tables 2 and 3 corre-
spond to the system submitted for SemEval-2010
Task 8. The score on the training data is lower be-
cause the data includes examples from SemEval-
2007, which has more of the harder to classify
Other relations9.

These tests have shown that the NomLex-Plus
feature likely did not help. Further, the depen-
dency parse feature added little beyond PropBank
and FrameNet. Given the high score for the lexical
feature set we split it into smaller sets to see their
contributions in the top portion of Table 3. This

9To confirm this we performed a 10 fold cross validation
of examples 1-7109, adding examples 7110-8000 (the 2007
data) to each training set. This resulted in an F1 of 82.18

tures on the training set. The bottom portion of

7 Conclusion
By combining various linguistic resources we
were able to build a state of the art system for
recognizing semantic relations in text. While the
large training size available in SemEval-2010 Task
8 enables achieving high scores using only word-
based features, richer linguistic and background-
knowledge resources still provide additional aid in
identifying semantic relations.
