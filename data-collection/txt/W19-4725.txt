Abstract

We measure the intensity of diachronic seman-
tic shifts in adjectives in English, Norwegian
and Russian across 5 decades. This is done in
order to test the hypothesis that evaluative ad-
jectives are more prone to temporal semantic
change. To this end, 6 different methods of
quantifying semantic change are used.

Frequency-controlled experimental results
show that, depending on the particular method,
evaluative adjectives either do not differ from
other types of adjectives in terms of semantic
change or appear to actually be less prone to
shifting (particularly, to ‘jitter’-type shifting).
Thus, in spite of many well-known examples
of semantically changing evaluative adjectives
(like ‘terrific’ or ‘incredible’), it seems that
such cases are not specific to this particular
type of words.

1 Introduction

Words change their meaning over time. It has be-
come widespread recently to trace such shifts us-
ing word embedding models (that is, using con-
textual cues from raw corpora). However, most of
this research is centred on the English language,
and focuses on nouns specifically. In this paper,
we work with 3 different languages (English, Nor-
wegian and Russian), and focus our attention on
adjectives.

Particularly, we aim to test empirically whether
evaluative adjectives are more susceptible to di-
achronic semantic shifts than other types of adjec-
tives. Evaluative adjectives are defined as those
which describe object qualities from the subjec-
tive point of view of the speakers, expressing their
opinions about the object being described. Typical
English examples are ‘good’, ‘bad’ or ‘brilliant’.

Sometimes, adjectives can become evaluative
in the course of semantic shifts happening across
time: consider the history of the English word

jective ‘monumental’: from sculptures in the sixties to
awesome in the 2000s

or how the word sick slowly acquires a (collo-
quial) evaluative sense (‘That’s sick, dude!’) as
described in Mitra et al. (2014). On the other
hand, intuitively, evaluative adjectives are natu-
rally prone to amelioration and pejoration as major
types of diachronic semantic shifts. One can im-
mediately recall, for example, the English words
incredible and terrific which underwent ameliora-
tion and started to denote positive instead of nega-
tive qualities.

But are these words only isolated hand-picked
examples, or is there a general trend in human lan-
guages which makes evaluative adjectives change
more intensely over time? In this paper, we try to
answer this question. Section 2 puts this work in
the context of previous research. In section 3, we
describe the corpora and word lists we relied upon.
Our experiments are described in 4. In sections 5
and 6 we outline the limitations of the presented
research, our plans for the future, and conclude.

2 Related work

The nature of semantic change processes has al-
ways been of special interest to linguistics. This
interest started at least as early as in Bréal (1883)
who asserted the intellectual (cognitive) laws of
semantic change as opposed to ‘natural’ ones.
Later, Bloomfield (1933) proposed a popular cat-
egorisation of semantic shifts into classes. Fur-
ther on, the academic community tried to de-
velop a theoretical understanding of reasons be-
hind semantic shifts, and to refine their classifica-
tion (Meillet, 1974).

Moving on to specific types of semantic shifts,
amelioration (acquiring more positive sentiment)
and pejoration (acquiring more negative senti-
ment) were studied in Borkowska and Kleparski
(2007), who mentioned these types to be one of
the strongest and most wide-spread.

As the amount of language data available to
computational linguistics increased,2 the focus of
research interest moved from theoretical reasoning
about the nature of semantic shifts to more em-
pirical approaches, mainly based on corpus-based
analysis (see Michel et al. (2011) and Jatowt and
Duh (2014), among many others).

Recently, the usage of pre-trained word embed-
dings (Bengio et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013a)
has become widespread in the publications related
to diachronic semantic shifts (Kim et al., 2014;
Hamilton et al., 2016c; Liao and Cheng, 2016; Ku-
tuzov et al., 2017b,a; Rosenfeld and Erk, 2018).
The main reason for this is the powerful abili-
ties of such approaches to model word meaning
based solely on non-annotated corpora. Addition-
ally, vector representations of words allow for easy
calculation of their similarities and changes. The
baseline method here consists of simply training
embedding models on the texts created in differ-
ent time periods, and then comparing the vector
representations for the same words. For further
information on the current state of the field, see
Kutuzov et al. (2018) and Tang (2018).

One of the difficulties brought by these ap-
proaches is the necessity to somehow ‘align’ the
vector spaces trained on different time bins (time
periods). A variety of methods have been pro-
posed to overcome this. They include initialis-
ing the models for each time bin with the weights

2For example, the Google Ngrams (https://books.
google.com/ngrams) service stimulated diachronic re-
search of texts and language greatly.

from models trained on the previous time bin
(‘incremental training’) (Kim et al., 2014); Pro-
crustes alignment of independent embedding mod-
els (Hamilton et al., 2016c); dynamic models
trained across all time bins at once (Bamler and
Mandt, 2017; Yao et al., 2018; Rosenfeld and Erk,
2018); Global Anchors (measuring the vectors of
words’ similarities to other words) (Yin et al.,
2018), etc. In this paper, we employ Procrustes
alignment and the Global Anchors methods, ap-
plying them to the task of measuring the speed
of semantic shifts of evaluative adjectives across
time.

An important publication related to our work is
Hamilton et al. (2016a). In it, the authors induce
historical sentiment lexicons from English corpora
(using word embeddings, among other methods).
They further show that amelioration and pejora-
tion do occur on a massive scale: many evaluative
adjectives in English have completely switched
their sentiment during the last 150 years. We
extend this work by studying not only sentiment
changes, but semantic shifts in evaluative adjec-
tives in general. Additionally, we analyse data
from 3 languages (English, Norwegian and Rus-
sian). However, we focus on a more narrow time
span: only the decades from 1960s to 2000s.

3 Data

In this section, we describe our data: the corpora
employed to train word embedding models, and
the sentiment lexicons serving as the source of
evaluative adjectives.

3.1 Corpora

For the purposes of our research, we employed
corpora in three languages, selecting texts which
were created during the five decades from 1960s
to 2000s. We lemmatized (it was especially im-
portant for Russian with its rich morphology)
and POS-tagged all the corpora ourselves, using
the corresponding UDPipe models (Straka and
Straková, 2017).

For English data, we used The Corpus of His-
torical American English (COHA).3 This is a cor-
pus of English texts annotated with creation dates
and balanced by genres. It is composed of fiction,
magazine and newspaper articles, as well as non-
fiction texts.

For Norwegian data, we used the NBdigital cor-
pus.4 It contains texts in Norwegian Bokmål from
the National Library of Norway’s collection of
free texts, obtained by OCR processing (only texts
with the OCR confidence higher than 0.9). These
texts were mainly produced by various public in-
stitutions.

For Russian data, we used the Russian National
Corpus (RNC).5 It includes a wide variety of gen-
res of written and spoken language, such as non-
translated works of fiction, memoirs, essays, jour-
nalistic works, scientific and popular scientific lit-
erature, public speeches, letters, diaries, docu-
ments, etc. It is important that the RNC is also rig-
orously balanced across genres and types of texts.

Table 1 lists the corpora sizes for each decade
under consideration.

3.2 Word embeddings

Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) embedding
models (Mikolov et al., 2013b) were trained on
each decade for each of the three languages. All
the models share the same set of hyperparameters:
vector size 300, symmetric context window size 3,
and 10 iterations over the corpus. We discarded all
the words which occurred less than 5 times in the
training corpus, and additionally limited the max-
imum vocabulary size to be 100 000, more or less
following the hyperparameters from Kutuzov et al.
(2017a). The models are made available via the
NLPL word vector repository6 (Fares et al., 2017).

3.3 Evaluative adjectives lists

In order to find out whether evaluative adjective
are more prone to diachronic semantic shifts, we
need an authoritative source providing us with a
list of such adjectives, more than only several
words in size. Unfortunately, even for English

serial=oai:nb.no:sbr-43&lang=en

5http://ruscorpora.ru/en/
6http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/

such a list is hard to find in the published works,
and the same is true for Norwegian and Russian.
For this reason, we turned to sentiment lexicons:
lists of positive and negative words widely used
for the purposes of automatic sentiment analy-
sis. The ratio is that such words are almost al-
ways evaluative by definition. Below we describe
these lexicons for each of the three languages un-
der analysis.

The lists for English and Norwegian come from
the same source. The English lexicon is a gen-
eral sentiment lexicon composed of a positive and
a negative lexicon. These were created by as-
signing the positive and negative labels using a
WordNet-based bootstrapping approach (Hu and
Liu, 2004)7. We thereafter automatically trans-
lated (from English to Norwegian) these positive
and negative sentiment lexicons. The translations
were manually checked, and corrected when nec-
essary. Furthermore, if an English word had sev-
eral senses that could be translated into different
Norwegian words, these were added to the trans-
lations. We have omitted all multi-word expres-
sions, and only kept single word translations. This
resulted in a collection of 3961 negative and 1646
positive Norwegian words. The original English
lexicons contained 4783 negative and 2006 posi-
tive words. We did not investigate rigorously to
what extent the translated lexicon is representative
of the Norwegian language, but we believe that it
is representative enough, since it is a general lexi-
con equivalent to its original English counterpart,
and because the Norwegian list was checked man-
ually to filter out non-evaluative adjectives.

The Norwegian lexical resource SCARRIE8, a
full-form lexicon, was used to identify which of
the Norwegian translations were adjectives. Once
these Norwegian adjectives were identified, we se-
lected only the English words that had a Norwe-
gian adjective as translation. Subsequently, we
used the WordNet (Miller, 1995) to identify which
of the selected English words were actually adjec-
tives. If an English word was not identified as an
adjective, we used WordNet to find its adjective
form by analysing the derivationally related forms
of its lemma. If no such form could be found,
then the English word was removed from our list.
Both lists were thereafter lemmatized and manu-

ally filtered to remove non-evaluative adjectives.
This resulted in 2250 English adjectives and 1939
Norwegian adjectives.

We borrowed Russian evaluative adjectives
from RuSentiLex (Loukachevitch and Levchik,
2016): a list of sentiment-related words and ex-
pressions. There are three types of entries in
RuSentiLex, depending on their source: ‘opinion’,
‘feeling’ and ‘fact’ (words or expressions that do
not express an opinion of the author, but have
a positive or negative connotation). Also, each
entry is labelled with its part of speech, lemma-
tized form and polarity, which can be positive,
negative, neutral or positive/negative for strong
context-dependent semantic orientation. Polyse-
mous words have separate entries for different
senses. The current version of the lexicon con-
tains more than 12 thousand words and expres-
sions, which were semi-automatically obtained
from existing domain-oriented sentiment vocabu-
laries (initial list), news articles (words with con-
notations) and Twitter (slang and curse words).
For this research we used only one-word adjec-
tives labelled with the ‘opinion’ source. Since dif-
ferences in the sentiment and polarity of polyse-
mous words are not taken into account in this pa-
per, repeated entries have been removed. In total,
there are 2435 Russian evaluative adjectives.

After acquiring the lists of evaluative adjectives
and training word embedding models on the texts
created for each decade under analysis, we were
able to move on to the experiments.

4 Experiments

Our general aim is to measure the speed of tem-
poral semantic shifts in evaluative adjectives com-
pared to all other adjective types. This is necessary
to confirm or reject the hypothesis that evaluative
adjectives are less stable than other words of the
same part of speech. We want to find evidence
across all three languages under analysis. We also
would like to control for frequency and to exclude
its influence on the results, since it is known that
word frequency often correlates with the speed of
semantic change (Hamilton et al., 2016c) 9.

We measure the speed of semantic changes us-
ing a variety of methods:

1. Jaccard distance (Jaccard, 1901) between
sets of 10 nearest neighbours of one word (by

9Note, however, that this was disputed in Dubossarsky
et al. (2017).

cosine distance) in two embedding models;

2. Procrustes alignment (Hamilton et al.,
2016c): the models’ vector spaces are first
aligned using an SVD-based orthogonal
transformation, and then cosine distance is
calculated between one word’s vectors in
two transformed models;

3. Global Anchors (Yin et al., 2018): here,
the degree of semantic change is defined as
the cosine distance between the vectors of a
word’s cosine similarities to all other words
in the intersection of two models’ vocabular-
ies (‘anchors’).

The aforementioned methods measure the dis-
tance between the meanings of one word in two
different embedding models. However, our data
includes five models (trained on five consequent
decades from 1960s to 2000s). In order to quan-
tify the speed of semantic change across the whole
time span, two techniques were used:

1. Mean distances: simple mean between the 4
pairwise distances (‘60s to 70s’, ‘70s to 80s’,
‘80s to 90s’, and ‘90s to 2000s’). It mea-
sures the degree of ‘semantic jitter’ that the
word undergoes: it is not necessarily a steady
movement into one direction, but can in-
stead be fluctuations around one centre point
(points).

2. Mean deltas from the 60s: here, at each
decade we calculate the distance of the cur-
rent word representation to its representation
in the 60s (the initial point of our time span).
If the distance increased, one point is added
to the word’s score, if the distance decreased,
one point is subtracted. Then, the average
score is calculated for each word. The ra-
tionale behind this is to measure how steady
the shift in meaning is from the initial point
for a given word. The score here will be low
for the words which fluctuate but do not re-
ally substantially change their semantics. At
the same time, it will be high for consistent
cases (like, for example, the English adjec-
tive ‘solid’ steadily moving toward denoting
not only qualities of materials, but also gen-
erally being of good quality). See, e.g., Fig-
ure 2 for an example of how a word can first
move away from the original meaning, but
then start to slowly return back.



206

Figure 2: Alterations in meaning of the Russian adjec-
tive ‘бескомпромиссный’ (uncompromising): from
ruthless over fanatical, passion, later conviction, heroic
to intransigence, confrontation

Both mean distances and mean deltas from the
60s can be used with any method of measuring se-
mantic change of the 3 described above, thus over-
all we have 6 scores to assign to each word in our
word lists.

Note that we have two word lists for each
language: the one with evaluative adjectives
(extracted from sentiment lexicons) and another
with what we will refer to as fillers: that is, simply
all other adjectives present in the vocabularies
of all five models for the current language. We
compare the semantic change speed scores of
the first list to those in the second one. If the
average values differ with the Welch’s T-test
p-value not exceeding 0.110, we conclude that one
type of adjectives is more subject to diachronic
semantic change than the other, and report the
t-statistics of the difference between the averages.
If the p-value exceeds the 0.1 threshold, we
conclude there is no difference between two lists,
and report it as 0 (full anabridged tables avail-
able at https://github.com/ltgoslo/
diachronic_multiling_adjectives/
tree/master/full_tables).

Table 2 presents the results calculated this way.
Positive t-statistic values mean that evaluative ad-
jectives change faster than other types of adjec-
tives, according to particular metrics; negative val-
ues mean they change slower. We also report the
number of filler adjectives (‘# fillers’) for each lan-
guage.

10The p-value threshold of 0.1 was used intentionally, in-
stead of the more standard 0.05. We could as well use 0.05,
and it wouldn’t change the final results of the research (the
original hypothesis would still be rejected). The reason be-
hind choosing 0.1 was to be able to show that some differ-
ences in the speed of semantic change between evaluative ad-
jectives and fillers can be found, but they are rare and fragile
even with a very permissive p-value threshold.

Table 2: Difference in the intensity of semantic shifts
between evaluative adjectives and fillers. Positive val-
ues correspond to evaluatives changing significantly
faster, and vice versa.

As can be seen, across all languages, evalua-
tive adjectives seem to fluctuate less (mean pair-
wise distances), as measured by all methods, ex-
cept for Global Anchors applied to English and
Russian. At the same time, the majority of meth-
ods agree that evaluative adjectives are more likely
to steady shift in one direction, farther and farther
away from the original meaning (as measured by
mean deltas from the 60s). This is less expressed
for Norwegian (with Jaccard and Global Anchors
methods, the difference between two types of ad-
jectives was not significant).

However, these values are potentially problem-
atic. As already mentioned, the speed of semantic
change can correlate with word frequencies. The
‘Freq diff’ line in the table 2 shows the difference
between average word frequencies in both word
lists (expressed as word probabilities relative to
corpora sizes). All these values are statistically
significant and positive: this means that evaluative
adjectives are on average more frequent than other
adjectives.

Table 3 proves that there are indeed statisti-
cally significant correlations between word fre-
quencies and all our methods for measuring the
intensity of temporal semantic shifts, across all
languages. More frequent words consistently get
lower scores from mean distances.11 Vice versa,
they get higher scores from the mean deltas tech-
nique, suggesting that frequent words are more
prone to steady semantic shifting.

et al. (2016c)

To get rid of the influence of the frequency fac-
tor in comparing evaluative and non-evaluative ad-
jectives, we have to make the average frequen-
cies of both lists more like each other. Since we
observed that evaluative adjectives are more fre-
quent, we decided to use the frequency threshold.
All adjectives with corpus frequency in at least one
decade lesser than the threshold (which is a hyper-
parameter) were removed from the word lists (both
evaluative adjectives and fillers) 12. This allowed
us to get rid of low-frequency long-tail and make
both lists to better fit each other in terms of fre-
quency. In the table 4, we report the results using
the threshold of 100.

The number of fillers has naturally declined.
12We did not down-sample the evaluative adjectives in-

stead, since they are the main focus of our research, and we
did not want to reduce their number (not huge to begin with).

Also, the ’Freq diff’ line shows that this way we
managed to eliminate any statistically significant
difference between evaluative and non-evaluative
word lists for English and Norwegian. For Rus-
sian data, the situation has reversed: now evalu-
ative adjectives are on average less frequent. In-
terestingly, the overall results for the ‘mean dis-
tances’ methods did not change or even became
more expressed. Even when controlled for fre-
quency, evaluative adjectives seem to be less prone
to ‘fluctuating’ semantic shifts. Thus, to some ex-
tent they are more semantically stable than other
adjectives. This makes us reject the initial hypoth-
esis about them being less stable.

Note that for the mean deltas technique, filter-
ing out the low-frequency words led to the differ-
ences between evaluative and non-evaluative ad-
jectives losing their statistical significance in al-
most all combinations of languages and methods.
Thus, we cannot prove any specificity of evalua-
tive adjectives with respect to the ‘steadiness’ of
diachronic semantic changes.

5 Limitations and future work

First of all, sentiment lexicons as sources of ‘eval-
uative adjectives’ are by all means only proxies.
It is quite probable that there are evaluative adjec-
tives beyond sentiment lexicons, and vice versa.
In the future, we plan to refine our datasets and
probably come up with more linguistically justi-
fied word lists.

Although we used the well-known methods of
measuring semantic shifts across word embedding
models, there is still a need to evaluate the meth-
ods themselves. One option here it to use the Sent-
Prop historical sentiment datasets from Hamilton
et al. (2016b). These datasets are created automat-
ically, but still this sanity check could allow us to
find out which of the algorithms produces results
better correlated with the output of other systems.
At the same time, it is known that distributional
models can have a hard time handling the differ-
ences between antonyms, and those constitute a
significant part of diachronic changes in SentProp
(cf. ‘incredible’ changing it sentiment from neg-
ative to positive in the last 40 years). There is an
ample room for further research here.

Note also that the interplay between semantic
shift detection methods and word frequencies is
quite complex, and there is still a room to inves-
tigation. We didn’t analyse it deeply, so we can-



208

not exclude the possibility that the results could
change if controlling for other related factors.

6 Conclusion

We measured the intensity of diachronic seman-
tic shifts in adjectives across 3 languages (English,
Norwegian and Russian) and 5 decades (60s, 70s,
80s, 90s, 2000s), to test whether evaluative adjec-
tives change faster (or more intensely) than other
adjectives.

Our results show that, contradictory to the initial
hypothesis, evaluative adjectives change over time
less intensely (statistically significant at p < 0.1),
if we measure change as the mean of pairwise
differences between successive decades, and not
as a steady ‘movement’ in one particular direc-
tion. This is not an artefact of frequency, since
we observe the same behaviour when controlling
for word frequencies.

At the same time, when measuring the proba-
bility of steady ‘moving away’ from an original
meaning across time, evaluative adjectives do not
differ from other adjectives at all (at least on any
statistically significant level).

To sum up, it seems that evaluative words (in
our case, adjectives) are not more prone to seman-
tic shifts than other word types. Vice versa, under
some circumstances, they can be even more sta-
ble than their counterparts, with this observation
holding across languages and methods of seman-
tic shifts tracing.

A Visualization

Visualisation algorithm is based on the method de-
scribed in (Hamilton et al., 2016c). To trace visu-
ally the movement of a given word in the semantic
space we take a union of m most similar words for
all periods that are of interest for us. Then t-SNE
(Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008), a technique
for dimensionality reduction, is used to fit embed-
dings into two dimensional space: for m nearest
neighbours, t-SNE embedding is found only on
the most recent period (which represents the most
recent meanings of these words), whereas for the
word under consideration, embeddings from all
time periods are taken into account. Procrustes
alignment is preliminarily applied so that embed-
dings of the target word from all time bins are
placed in common embedding space.
