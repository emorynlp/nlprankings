Abstract

Structural information in web text pro-
vides natural annotations for NLP prob-
lems such as word segmentation and pars-
ing. In this paper we propose a discrim-
inative learning algorithm to take advan-
tage of the linguistic knowledge in large
amounts of natural annotations on the In-
ternet. It utilizes the Internet as an external
corpus with massive (although slight and
sparse) natural annotations, and enables a
classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and
real-time updated web text. With Chinese
word segmentation as a case study, exper-
iments show that the segmenter enhanced
with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig-
nificant improvement on a series of testing
sets from different domains, even with a
single classifier and local features.

1 Introduction

Problems related to information retrieval, machine
translation and social computing need fast and ac-
curate text processing, for example, word segmen-
tation and parsing. Taking Chinese word seg-
mentation for example, the state-of-the-art mod-
els (Xue and Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004;
Gao et al., 2005; Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007;
Zhao and Kit, 2008; Jiang et al., 2009; Zhang and
Clark, 2010; Sun, 2011b; Li, 2011) are usually
trained on human-annotated corpora such as the
Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al., 2005),
and perform quite well on corresponding test sets.
Since the text used for corpus annotating are usu-
ally drawn from specific fields (e.g. newswire or
finance), and the annotated corpora are limited in

size (e.g. tens of thousands), the performance of
word segmentation tends to degrade sharply when
applied to new domains.

Internet provides large amounts of raw text, and
statistics collected from it have been used to im-
prove parsing performance (Nakov and Hearst,
2005; Pitler et al., 2010; Bansal and Klein, 2011;
Zhou et al., 2011). The Internet also gives mas-
sive (although slight and sparse) natural annota-
tions in the forms of structural information includ-
ing hyperlinks, fonts, colors and layouts (Sun,
2011a). These annotations usually imply valuable
knowledge for problems such as word segmen-
tation and parsing, based on the hypothesis that
the subsequences marked by structural informa-
tion are meaningful fragments in sentences. Fig-
ure 1 shows an example. The hyperlink indicates

761



a Chinese phrase (meaning NLP), and it probably
corresponds to a connected sub-graph for depen-
dency parsing. Creators of web text give valuable
annotations during editing, the whole Internet can
be treated as a wide-coveraged and real-time up-
dated corpus.

Different from the dense and accurate annota-
tions in human-annotated corpora, natural annota-
tions in web text are sparse and slight, it makes
direct training of NLP models impracticable. In
this work we take for example a most important
problem, word segmentation, and propose a novel
discriminative learning algorithm to leverage the
knowledge in massive natural annotations of web
text. Character classification models for word seg-
mentation usually factorize the whole prediction
into atomic predictions on characters (Xue and
Shen, 2003; Ng and Low, 2004). Natural anno-
tations in web text can be used to get rid of im-
plausible predication candidates for related char-
acters, knowledge in the natural annotations is
therefore introduced in the manner of searching
space pruning. Since constraint decoding in the
pruned searching space integrates the knowledge
of the baseline model and natural annotations, it
gives predictions not worse than the normal decod-
ing does. Annotation differences between the out-
puts of constraint decoding and normal decoding
are used to train the enhanced classifier. This strat-
egy makes the usage of natural annotations simple
and universal, which facilitates the utilization of
massive web text and the extension to other NLP
problems.

Although there are lots of choices, we choose
the Chinese wikipedia as the knowledge source
due to its high quality. Structural information, in-
cluding hyperlinks, fonts and colors are used to de-
termine the boundaries of meaningful fragments.
Experimental results show that, the knowledge im-
plied in the natural annotations can significantly
improve the performance of a baseline segmenter
trained on CTB 5.0, an F-measure increment of
0.93 points on CTB test set, and an average incre-
ment of 1.53 points on 7 other domains. It is an ef-
fective and inexpensive strategy to build word seg-
menters adaptive to different domains. We hope to
extend this strategy to other NLP problems such
as named entity recognition and parsing.

In the rest of the paper, we first briefly intro-
duce the problems of Chinese word segmentation
and the character classification model in section

learning on natural annotations in section 4. Af-
ter giving the experimental results and analysis in

work and then give the conclusion and the expec-
tation of future research.

2 Character Classification Model

Character classification models for word segmen-
tation factorize the whole prediction into atomic
predictions on single characters (Xue and Shen,
2003; Ng and Low, 2004). Although natural anno-
tations in web text do not directly support the dis-
criminative training of segmentation models, they
do get rid of the implausible candidates for predic-
tions of related characters.

Given a sentence as a sequence of n charac-
ters, word segmentation splits the sequence into
m(≤ n) subsequences, each of which indicates a
meaningful word. Word segmentation can be for-
malized as a character classification problem (Xue
and Shen, 2003), where each character in the sen-
tence is given a boundary tag representing its posi-
tion in a word. We adopt the boundary tags of Ng
and Low (2004), b, m, e and s, where b, m and
e mean the beginning, the middle and the end of a
word, and s indicates a single-character word. the
decoding procedure searches for the labeled char-
acter sequence y that maximizes the score func-

The score of the whole sequence y is accumulated

1 ≤ i ≤ n and t ∈ {b,m, e, s}). The feature
function Φ maps a labeled sequence or a character-
label pair into a feature vector, ~α is the parame-
ter vector and Φ(x, y) · ~α is the inner product of
Φ(x, y) and ~α.

Analogous to other sequence labeling prob-
lems, word segmentation can be solved through a
viterbi-style decoding procedure. We omit the de-
coding algorithm in this paper due to its simplicity
and popularity.

The feature templates for the classifier is shown
in Table 1. C0 denotes the current character, while
C−k/Ck denote the kth character to the left/right
of C0. The function Pu(·) returns true for a punc-
tuation character and false for others, the function
T (·) classifies a character into four types, 1, 2, 3
and 4, representing number, date, English letter
and others, respectively.

The classifier can be trained with online learn-
ing algorithms such as perceptron, or offline learn-
ing models such as support vector machines.
We choose the perceptron algorithm (Collins,
2002) to train the classifier for the character
classification-based word segmentation model. It
learns a discriminative model mapping from the
inputs x ∈ X to the outputs ỹ ∈ Y , where X is the
set of sentences in the training corpus and Y is the
set of corresponding labeled results. Algorithm 1
shows the perceptron algorithm for tuning the pa-
rameter ~α. The “averaged parameters” technology
(Collins, 2002) is used for better performance.

3 Knowledge in Natural Annotations

Web text gives massive natural annotations in the
form of structural informations, including hyper-
links, fonts, colors and layouts (Sun, 2011a). Al-
though slight and sparse, these annotations imply
valuable knowledge for problems such as word
segmentation and parsing.

As shown in Figure 1, the subsequence P =
i..j of sentence S is composed of bolded charac-
ters determined by a hyperlink. Such natural anno-
tations do not clearly give each character a bound-
ary tag, or define the head-modifier relationship
between two words. However, they do help to
shrink the set of plausible predication candidates
for each character or word. For word segmenta-
tion, it implies that characters i − 1 and j are the
rightmost characters of words, while characters i
and j + 1 are the leftmost characters of words.
For i − 1 or j, the plausible predication set Ψ be-
comes {e, s}; For i and j + 1, it becomes {b, s};
For other characters c except the two at sentence
boundaries, Ψ(c) is still {b,m, e, s}. For depen-
dency parsing, the subsequence P tends to form
a connected dependency graph if it contains more
than one word. Here we use Ψ to denote the set of
plausible head of a word (modifier). There must
be a single word w ∈ P as the root of subse-
quence P , whose plausible heads fall out of P ,
that is, Ψ(w) = {x|x ∈ S − P}. For the words
in P except the root, the plausible heads for each

word w are the words in P except w itself, that is,
Ψ(w) = {x|x ∈ P − {w}}.

Creators of web text give valuable structural
annotations during editing, these annotations re-
duce the predication uncertainty for atomic char-
acters or words, although not exactly defining
which predication is. Figure 2 shows an exam-
ple for word segmentation, depicting the shrink
of searching space for the character classification-
based model. Since the decrement of uncertainty
indicates the increment of knowledge, the whole
Internet can be treated as a wide-coveraged and
real-time updated corpus. We choose the Chinese
wikipedia as the external knowledge source, and
structural information including hyperlinks, fonts
and colors are used in the current work due to their
explicitness of representation.

4 Learning with Natural Annotations

Different from the dense and accurate annotations
in human-annotated corpora, natural annotations
are sparse and slight, which makes direct training
of NLP models impracticable. Annotations im-
plied by structural information do not give an ex-
act predication to a character, however, they help
to get rid of the implausible predication candidates
for related characters, as described in the previous
section.

Previous work on constituency parsing or ma-
chine translation usually resort to some kinds of
heuristic tricks, such as punctuation restrictions,
to eliminate some implausible candidates during
decoding. Here the natural annotations also bring
knowledge in the manner of searching space prun-
ing. Conditioned on the completeness of the de-
coding algorithm, a model trained on an exist-
ing corpus probably gives better or at least not
worse predications, by constraint decoding in the
pruned searching space. The constraint decoding
procedure integrates the knowledge of the baseline

Algorithm 3 Online version of perceptron learn-
ing with natural annotations.

2: for x with natural annotations do

4: ỹ ← CONSTRAINTDECODE(x, ~α,Ψ)

7: output ~α at regular time

model and natural annotations, the predication dif-
ferences between the outputs of constraint decod-
ing and normal decoding can be used to train the
enhanced classifier.

Restrictions of the searching space according to
natural annotations can be easily incorporated into
the decoder. If the completeness of the searching
algorithm can be guaranteed, the constraint decod-
ing in the pruned searching space will give predi-
cations not worse than those given by the normal
decoding. If a predication of constraint decoding
differs from that of normal decoding, it indicates
that the annotation precision is higher than the lat-
ter. Furthermore, the degree of difference between
the two predications represents the amount of new
knowledge introduced by the natural annotations
over the baseline.

The baseline model ~α is trained on an exist-
ing human-annotated corpus. A set of sentences
F with natural annotations are extracted from the
Chinese wikipedia, and we reserve the ones for
which constraint decoding and normal decoding
give different predications. The predictions of re-
served sentences by constraint decoding are used
as additional training data for the enhanced classi-
fier. The overall training pipeline is analogous to
self-training (McClosky et al., 2006), Algorithm
2 shows the pseudo-codes. Considering the online
characteristic of the perceptron algorithm, if we
are able to leverage much more (than the Chinese
wikipedia) data with natural annotations, an online
version of learning procedure shown in Algorithm
3 would be a better choice. The technology of “av-
eraged parameters” (Collins, 2002) is easily to be
adapted here for better performance.

When constraint decoding and normal decod-
ing give different predications, we only know that
the former is probably better than the latter. Al-
though there is no explicit evidence for us to mea-
sure how much difference in accuracy between the

two predications, we can approximate how much
new knowledge that a naturally annotated sentence
brings. For a sentence x, given the predications of
constraint decoding and normal decoding, ỹ and
y, the difference of their scores δ = S(y) − S(ỹ)
indicates the degree to which the current model
mistakes. This indicator helps us to select more
valuable training examples.

The strategy of learning with natural annota-
tions can be adapted to other situations. For ex-
ample, if we have a list of words or phrases (espe-
cially in a specific domain such as medicine and
chemical), we can generate annotated sentences
automatically by string matching in a large amount
of raw text. It probably provides a simple and
effective domain adaptation strategy for already
trained models.

5 Experiments

We use the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0 (CTB)
(Xue et al., 2005) as the existing annotated cor-
pus for Chinese word segmentation. For conve-
nient of comparison with other work in word seg-
mentation, the whole corpus is split into three par-
titions as follows: chapters 271-300 for testing,
chapters 301-325 for developing, and others for
training. We choose the Chinese wikipedia 1 (ver-
sion 20120812) as the external knowledge source,
because it has high quality in contents and it is
much better than usual web text. Structural infor-
mations, including hyperlinks, fonts and colors are
used to derive the annotation information.

To further evaluate the improvement brought
by the fuzzy knowledge in Chinese wikipedia, a
series of testing sets from different domains are
adopted. The four testing sets from SIGHAN
Bakeoff 2010 (Zhao and Liu, 2010) are used, they
are drawn from the domains of literature, finance,
computer science and medicine. Although the ref-
erence sets are annotated according to a different

quantity of accuracy improvement is still illustra-
tive since there are no vast diversities between the
two segmentation standards. We also annotated
another three testing sets 2, their texts are drawn
from the domains of chemistry, physics and ma-
chinery, and each contains 500 sentences.

5.1 Baseline Classifier for Word
Segmentation

We train the baseline perceptron classifier for
word segmentation on the training set of CTB
5.0, using the developing set to determine the
best training iterations. The performance mea-
surement for word segmentation is balanced F-
measure, F = 2PR/(P +R), a function of preci-
sion P and recall R, where P is the percentage of
words in segmentation results that are segmented
correctly, and R is the percentage of correctly seg-
mented words in the gold standard words.

Figure 3 shows the learning curve of the aver-
aged perceptron on the developing set. The sec-
ond column of Table 3 lists the performance of
the baseline classifier on eight testing sets, where
newswire denotes the testing set of the CTB it-
self. The classifier performs much worse on the
domains of chemistry, physics and machinery, it
indicates the importance of domain adaptation for
word segmentation (Gao et al., 2004; Ma and
Way, 2009; Gao et al., 2010). The accuracy on the
testing sets from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2010 is even
lower due to the difference in both domains and
word segmentation standards.

5.2 Classifier Enhanced with Natural
Annotations

The Chinese wikipedia contains about 0.5 million
items. From their description text, about 3.9 mil-
lions of sentences with natural annotations are ex-
tracted. With the CTB training set as the exist-
ing corpus C, about 0.8 million sentences are re-
served according to Algorithm 2, the segmenta-
tions given by constraint decoding are used as ad-
ditional training data for the enhanced classifier.

According to the previous description, the dif-
ference of the scores of constraint decoding and
normal decoding, δ = S(y) − S(ỹ), indicates
the importance of a constraint segmentation to the
improvement of the baseline classifier. The con-
straint segmentations of the reserved sentences are
sorted in descending order according to the dif-
ference of the scores of constraint decoding and
normal decoding, as described previously. From
the beginning of the sorted list, different amounts
of segmented sentences are used as the additional
training data for the enhanced character classifier.
Figure 4 shows the performance curve of the en-
hanced classifiers on the developing set of CTB.
We found that the highest accuracy was achieved
when 160, 000 sentences were used, while more
additional training data did not give continuous
improvement. A recent related work about self-
training for segmentation (Liu and Zhang, 2012)
also reported a very similar trend, that only a mod-
erate amount of raw data gave the most obvious
improvements.

The performance of the enhanced classifier is
listed in the third column of Table 3. On the

wikipedia brings an F-measure increment of 0.93
points. On out-of-domain testing sets, the im-
provements are much larger, an average increment
of 1.53 points is achieved on seven domains. It
is probably because the distribution of the knowl-
edge in the CTB training data is concentrated in
the domain of newswire, while the contents of
the Chinese wikipedia cover a broad range of do-
mains, it provides knowledge complementary to
that of CTB.

Table 4 shows the comparison with other
work in Chinese word segmentation. Our model
achieves an accuracy higher than that of the
state-of-the-art models trained on CTB only, al-
though using a single classifier with only local
features. From the viewpoint of resource uti-
lization, the comparison between our system and
previous work without using additional training
data is unfair. However, we believe this work
shows another interesting way to improve Chi-
nese word segmentation, it focuses on the utiliza-
tion of fuzzy and sparse knowledge on the Internet
rather than making full use of a specific human-
annotated corpus. On the other hand, since only
a single classifier and local features are used in
our method, better performance could be achieved

766



resorting to complicated features, system com-
bination and other semi-supervised technologies.
What is more, since the text on Internet is wide-
coveraged and real-time updated, our strategy also
helps a word segmenter be more domain adaptive
and up to date.

6 Related Work

Li and Sun (2009) extracted character classifi-
cation instances from raw text for Chinese word
segmentation, resorting to the indication of punc-
tuation marks between characters. Sun and Xu
(Sun and Xu, 2011) utilized the features derived
from large-scaled unlabeled text to improve Chi-
nese word segmentation. Although the two work
also made use of large-scaled raw text, our method
is essentially different from theirs in the aspects
of both the source of knowledge and the learning
strategy.

Lots of efforts have been devoted to semi-
supervised methods in sequence labeling and word
segmentation (Xu et al., 2008; Suzuki and Isozaki,
2008; Haffari and Sarkar, 2008; Tomanek and
Hahn, 2009; Wang et al., 2011). A semi-
supervised method tries to find an optimal hyper-
plane of both annotated data and raw data, thus to
result in a model with better coverage and higher
accuracy. Researchers have also investigated un-
supervised methods in word segmentation (Zhao
and Kit, 2008; Johnson and Goldwater, 2009;
Mochihashi et al., 2009; Hewlett and Cohen,
2011). An unsupervised method mines the latent
distribution regularity in the raw text, and auto-
matically induces word segmentation knowledge
from it. Our method also needs large amounts of
external data, but it aims to leverage the knowl-
edge in the fuzzy and sparse annotations. It is
fundamentally different from semi-supervised and
unsupervised methods in that we aimed to exca-
vate a totally different kind of knowledge, the nat-
ural annotations implied by the structural informa-
tion in web text.

In recent years, much work has been devoted to
the improvement of word segmentation in a vari-
ety of ways. Typical approaches include the in-
troduction of global training or complicated fea-
tures (Zhang and Clark, 2007; Zhang and Clark,
2010), the investigation of word internal structures
(Zhao, 2009; Li, 2011), the adjustment or adapta-
tion of word segmentation standards (Wu, 2003;
Gao et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009), the integrated

solution of segmentation and related tasks such as
part-of-speech tagging and parsing (Zhou and Su,
2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Fung et al., 2004; Gold-
berg and Tsarfaty, 2008), and the strategies of hy-
brid or stacked modeling (Nakagawa and Uchi-
moto, 2007; Kruengkrai et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2010; Sun, 2011b).

In parsing, Pereira and Schabes (1992) pro-
posed an extended inside-outside algorithm that
infers the parameters of a stochastic CFG from a
partially parsed treebank. It uses partial bracket-
ing information to improve parsing performance,
but it is specific to constituency parsing, and its
computational complexity makes it impractical for
massive natural annotations in web text. There
are also work making use of word co-occurrence
statistics collected in raw text or Internet n-grams
to improve parsing performance (Nakov and
Hearst, 2005; Pitler et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011;
Bansal and Klein, 2011). When enriching the re-
lated work during writing, we found a work on de-
pendency parsing (Spitkovsky et al., 2010) who
utilized parsing constraints derived from hypertext
annotations to improve the unsupervised depen-
dency grammar induction. Compared with their
method, the strategy we proposed is formal and
universal, the discriminative learning strategy and
the quantitative measurement of fuzzy knowledge
enable more effective utilization of the natural an-
notation on the Internet when adapted to parsing.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

This work presents a novel discriminative learning
algorithm to utilize the knowledge in the massive
natural annotations on the Internet. Natural anno-
tations implied by structural information are used
to decrease the searching space of the classifier,
then the constraint decoding in the pruned search-
ing space gives predictions not worse than the nor-
mal decoding does. Annotation differences be-
tween the outputs of constraint decoding and nor-
mal decoding are used to train the enhanced classi-
fier, linguistic knowledge in the human-annotated
corpus and the natural annotations of web text
are thus integrated together. Experiments on Chi-
nese word segmentation show that, the enhanced
word segmenter achieves significant improvement
on testing sets of different domains, although us-
ing a single classifier with only local features.

Since the contents of web text cover a broad
range of domains, it provides knowledge comple-

mentary to that of human-annotated corpora with
concentrated distribution of domains. The content
on the Internet is large-scaled and real-time up-
dated, it compensates for the drawback of expen-
sive building and updating of corpora. Our strat-
egy, therefore, enables us to build a classifier more
domain adaptive and up to date. In the future, we
will compare this method with self-training to bet-
ter illustrate the importance of boundary informa-
tion, and give error analysis on what types of er-
rors are reduced by the method to make this inves-
tigation more complete. We will also investigate
more efficient algorithms to leverage more mas-
sive web text with natural annotations, and further
extend the strategy to other NLP problems such as
named entity recognition and parsing.
