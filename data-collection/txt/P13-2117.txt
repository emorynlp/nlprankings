Abstract

Distant supervision has attracted recent in-
terest for training information extraction
systems because it does not require any
human annotation but rather employs ex-
isting knowledge bases to heuristically la-
bel a training corpus. However, previous
work has failed to address the problem
of false negative training examples misla-
beled due to the incompleteness of knowl-
edge bases. To tackle this problem, we
propose a simple yet novel framework that
combines a passage retrieval model using
coarse features into a state-of-the-art rela-
tion extractor using multi-instance learn-
ing with fine features. We adapt the in-
formation retrieval technique of pseudo-
relevance feedback to expand knowledge
bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked
passages are more likely to express a rela-
tion. Our proposed technique significantly
improves the quality of distantly super-
vised relation extraction, boosting recall
from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently
high level of precision of around 93% in
the experiments.

1 Introduction

A recent approach for training information ex-
traction systems is distant supervision, which ex-
ploits existing knowledge bases instead of anno-
tated texts as the source of supervision (Craven
and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009; Nguyen
and Moschitti, 2011). To combat the noisy train-
ing data produced by heuristic labeling in distant
supervision, researchers (Bunescu and Mooney,
2007; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011;
Surdeanu et al., 2012) exploited multi-instance

Mellon University.

learning models. Only a few studies have directly
examined the influence of the quality of the train-
ing data and attempted to enhance it (Sun et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2011; Takamatsu et al., 2012).
However, their methods are handicapped by the
built-in assumption that a sentence does not ex-
press a relation unless it mentions two entities
which participate in the relation in the knowledge
base, leading to false negatives.

sion

In reality, knowledge bases are often incom-
plete, giving rise to numerous false negatives in
the training data. We sampled 1834 sentences that
contain two entities in the New York Times 2006
corpus and manually evaluated whether they ex-
press any of a set of 50 common Freebase1 rela-
tions. As shown in Figure 1, of the 133 (7.3%)
sentences that truly express one of these relations,
only 32 (1.7%) are covered by Freebase, leaving
101 (5.5%) false negatives. Even for one of the
most complete relations in Freebase, Employee-of
(with more than 100,000 entity pairs), 6 out of 27
sentences with the pattern ‘PERSON executive of
ORGANIZATION’ contain a fact that is not in-
cluded in Freebase and are thus mislabeled as neg-
ative. These mislabelings dilute the discriminative
capability of useful features and confuse the mod-
els. In this paper, we will show how reducing this
source of noise can significantly improve the per-
formance of distant supervision. In fact, our sys-
tem corrects the relation labels of the above 6 sen-
tences before training the relation extractor.

Encouraged by the recent success of simple
methods for coreference resolution (Raghunathan
et al., 2010) and inspired by pseudo-relevance
feedback (Xu and Croft, 1996; Lavrenko and
Croft, 2001; Matveeva et al., 2006; Cao et al.,
2008) in the field of information retrieval, which
expands or reformulates query terms based on
the highest ranked documents of an initial query,
we propose to increase the quality and quantity
of training data generated by distant supervision
for information extraction task using pseudo feed-
back. As shown in Figure 2, we expand an orig-
inal knowledge base with possibly missing rela-
tion instances with information from the highest
ranked sentences returned by a passage retrieval
model (Xu et al., 2011) trained on the same data.
We use coarse features for our passage retrieval
model to aggressively expand the knowledge base
for maximum recall; at the same time, we exploit
a multi-instance learning model with fine features
for relation extraction to handle the newly intro-
duced false positives and maintain high precision.

Similar to iterative bootstrapping tech-
niques (Yangarber, 2001), this mechanism uses
the outputs of the first trained model to expand
training data for the second model, but unlike
bootstrapping it does not require iteration and
avoids the problem of semantic drift. We further
note that iterative bootstrapping over a single
distant supervision system is difficult, because
state-of-the-art systems (Surdeanu et al., 2012;
Hoffmann et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2010; Mintz
et al., 2009), detect only few false negatives in the

training data due to their high-precision low-recall
features, which were originally proposed by Mintz
et al. (2009). We present a reliable and novel way
to address these issues and achieve significant
improvement over the MULTIR system (Hoff-
mann et al., 2011), increasing recall from 47.7%
to 61.2% at comparable precision. The key to this
success is the combination of two different views
as in co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998):
an information extraction technique with fine
features for high precision and an information
retrieval technique with coarse features for high
recall. Our work is developed in parallel with
Min et al. (2013), who take a very different
approach by adding additional latent variables to
a multi-instance multi-label model (Surdeanu et
al., 2012) to solve this same problem.

2 System Details

In this section, we first introduce some formal no-
tations then describe in detail each component of
the proposed system in Figure 2.

2.1 Definitions

A relation instance is an expression r(e1, e2)
where r is a binary relation, and e1 and e2 are
two entities having such a relation, for example
CEO-of(Tim Cook, Apple). The knowledge-based
distant supervised learning problem takes as input
(1) Σ, a training corpus, (2) E, a set of entities
mentioned in that corpus, (3) R, a set of relation
names, and (4) ∆, a set of ground facts of relations
in R. To generate our training data, we further as-
sume (5) T , a set of entity types, as well as type
signature r(E1, E2) for relations.

We define the positive data set POS(r) to be
the set of sentences in which any related pair
of entities of relation r (according to the knowl-
edge base) is mentioned. The negative data set
RAW (r) is the rest of the training data, which
contain two entities of the required types in the
knowledge base, e.g. one person and one or-
ganization for the CEO-of relation in Freebase.
Another negative data set with more conservative
sense NEG(r) is defined as the set of sentences
which contain the primary entity e1 (e.g. person
in any CEO-of relation in the knowledge base) and
any secondary entity e2 of required type (e.g. or-
ganization for the CEO-of relation) but the relation
does not hold for this pair of entities in the knowl-
edge base.

2.2 Distantly Supervised Passage Retrieval

We extend the learning-to-rank techniques (Liu,
2011) to distant supervision setting (Xu et al.,
2011) to create a robust passage retrieval system.
While relation extraction systems exploit rich and
complex features that are necessary to extract the
exact relation (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al.,
2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011), passage retrieval
components use coarse features in order to provide
different and complementary feedback to informa-
tion extraction models.

We exploit two types of lexical features: Bag-
Of-Words and Word-Position. The two types of
simple binary features are shown in the following
example:

Sentence: Apple founder Steve Jobs died.
Target (Primary) entity: Steve Jobs
Bag-Of-Word features: ‘apple’ ‘founder’ ‘died’ ‘.’
Word-Position features: ‘apple:-2’ ‘founder:-1’

‘died:+1’ ‘.:+2’

For each relation r, we assume each sentence
has a binary relevance label to form distantly su-
pervised training data: sentences in POS(r) are
relevant and sentences in NEG(r) are irrelevant.
As a pointwise learning-to-rank approach (Nallap-
ati, 2004), the probabilities of relevance estimated
by SVMs (Platt and others, 1999) are used for
ranking all the sentences in the original training
corpus for each relation respectively. We use Lib-
SVM 2 (Chang and Lin, 2011) in our implementa-
tion.

2.3 Psuedo-relevance Relation Feedback

In the field of information retrieval, pseudo-
relevance feedback assumes that the top-ranked
documents from an initial retrieval are likely rel-
evant, and extracts relevant terms to expand the
original query (Xu and Croft, 1996; Lavrenko and
Croft, 2001; Cao et al., 2008). Analogously, our
assumption is that entity pairs that appear in more
relevant and more sentences are more likely to
express the relation, and can be used to expand
knowledge base and reduce false negative noise in
the training data for information extraction. We
identify the most likely relevant entity pairs as fol-
lows:

learn a passage (sentence) retrieval model L(r)

score the sentences in the RAW (r) by L(r)
score the entity pairs according to the scores

of sentences they are involved in
select the top ranked pairs of entities, then add

the relation r to their label in ∆′

end for

We select the entity pairs whose average score
of the sentences they are involved in is greater
than p, where p is a parameter tuned on develop-
ment data.3 The relation extraction model is then
trained using (Σ, E,R,∆′) with a more complete
database than the original knowledge base ∆.

2.4 Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction

We use a state-of-the-art open-source system,
MULTIR (Hoffmann et al., 2011), as the rela-
tion extraction component. MULTIR is based
on multi-instance learning, which assumes that
at least one sentence of those matching a given
entity-pair contains the relation of interest (Riedel
et al., 2010) in the given knowledge base to tol-
erate false positive noise in the training data and
superior than previous models (Riedel et al., 2010;
Mintz et al., 2009) by allowing overlapping rela-
tions. MULTIR uses features which are based on
Mintz et al. (2009) and consist of conjunctions of
named entity tags, syntactic dependency paths be-
tween arguments, and lexical information.

3 Experiments

For evaluating extraction accuracy, we follow the
experimental setup of Hoffmann et al. (2011), and
use their implementation of MULTIR4 with 50
training iterations as our baseline. Our complete
system, which we call IRMIE, combines our pas-
sage retrieval component with MULTIR. We use
the same datasets as in Hoffmann et al. (2011) and
Riedel et al. (2010), which include 3-years of New
York Times articles aligned with Freebase. The
sentential extraction evaluation is performed on
a small amount of manually annotated sentences,
sampled from the union of matched sentences and

system predictions. We define Se as the sentences
where some system extracted a relation and SF

as the sentences that match the arguments of a
fact in ∆. The sentential precision and recall is
computed on a randomly sampled set of sentences
from Se∪SF , in which each sentence is manually
labeled whether it expresses any relation in R.

Figure 3 shows the precision/recall curves for
MULTIR with and without pseudo-relevance feed-
back computed on the test dataset of 1000 sen-
tence used by Hoffmann et al. (2011). With the
pseudo-relevance feedback from passage retrieval,
IRMIE achieves significantly higher recall at a
consistently high level of precision. At the highest
recall point, IRMIE reaches 78.5% precision and
59.2% recall, for an F1 score of 68.9%.

Because the two types of lexical features used in
our passage retrieval models are not used in MUL-
TIR, we created another baseline MULTIRLEX
by adding these features into MULTIR in order
to rule out the improvement from additional infor-
mation. Note that the sentences are sampled from
the union of Freebase matches and sentences from
which some systems in Hoffmann et al. (2011) ex-
tracted a relation. It underestimates the improve-
ments of the newly developed systems in this pa-
per. We therefore also created a new test set of
1000 sentences by sampling from the union of
Freebase matches and sentences where MULTIR-
LEX or IRMIELEX extracted a relation. Table 1
shows the overall precision and recall computed
against these two test datasets, with and without
adding lexical features into multi-instance learn-
ing models. The performance improvement by us-
ing pseudo-feedback is significant (p < 0.05) in
McNemar’s test for both datasets.

greatly improves a state-of-the-art multi-instance
learning model by correcting the most likely false
negatives in the training data based on the ranking
of a passage retrieval model.

In the future, we would like to more tightly inte-
grate a coarser featured estimator of sentential rel-
evance and a finer featured relation extractor, such
that a single joint-model can be learned.
