Abstract

Regarding the construction of an ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as fundamental in

terms of establishing a conceptual framework to guide and facilitate the construction of a large-scale

lexical resource (LR) database of the Japanese lexicon, this paper primarily focuses on two major

concerns for the construction of the JLP-O. The first is to map out and appropriately structure the

numerous lexical and psycholinguistic properties, or variables, associated with the Japanese lexicon.

The second concern is to specify an appropriate range of lexical entries classes within the JLP-O.

Both concerns have far-reaching implications for effectively capturing the rich patterns of intercon-

nections among lexical entries and lexical properties and thus for realizing a multifunctional LR.

After discussing the solutions integrated into the current Resource Description Framework (RDF)

representation of the JLP-O, the paper also briefly describes the extraction of a corpus-based lexicon

from the recently released Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese (BCCWJ; Maekawa

et al., 2013), an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon. Categorized according

to the JLP-O’s range of lexical entry classes, and supplemented with orthographic variant and decom-

position information, the BCCWJ-based lexicon represents a key reference LR for constructing the

large-scale LR.

1 Introduction

The overarching objective of our research project is to construct a large-scale lexical resource (LR) of

Japanese lexical properties—interpreted inclusively as any characteristic or variable associated with words—

which, as a comprehensivemodel of the Japanese lexicon, can potentially be beneficial for various researchers

within the linguistic and cognitive sciences. Within that larger endeavor, we regard the task of constructing

an ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as being absolutely foundational for two important rea-

sons. The first is primarily pragmatic in nature. As reflected in the relatively recent trend towards merging

LRs and ontologies (Huang et al., 2010; Oltramari et al., 2013), the formal specification of the ontology can

unquestionably provide considerable advantages in terms of enhanced compatibility with natural language

processing (NLP) and knowledge system tools for efficiently integrating data, checking for consistency, and

realizing powerful query functionality. In contrast, however, the second reason is both more conceptual and

more skeptical in nature. In many ways, ontology construction can be thought of as the very epitome of aca-

demic endeavor in seeking to clearly elucidate the phenomenon of interest, but it is also crucial to understand

that natural systems, such as language, do not necessarily conform to the standards of ontological complete-

ness. As outlined further in section 2, our approach to ontology construction particularly values the utility of

the ontology as working conceptual framework. Reflecting this, our approach attempts to strike a reasonable

balance between ontological rigor, on the one hand, and recognizing a number of other important cognitive

criteria, on the other hand, such as theoretical description, consistencies, psychological reality, and prefer-

ences, in order to realize a core framework that can both guide the construction of the LR and, ultimately,

facilitate multifunctional querying.

Against that larger background, this paper specifically focuses on two major concerns addressed in con-

structing the JLP-O. Given the extensive range of Japanese lexical properties that must be represented in a

satisfactory manner within a large-scale LR for the Japanese lexicon, the first concern has been to map out

and appropriately structure the many and varied lexical and psycholinguistic properties, or variables, asso-

ciated with the Japanese lexicon into domains, or modules. The second major concern has been to specify

an appropriate range of lexical entries as core entities of the JLP-O for a highly agglutinative language like

Japanese. As outlined in more detail in section 3, these concerns have direct implications for implementing

effective links among lexical entries and lexical properties. In section 4, we explain how both concerns have

been resolved within the JLP-O in ways that simultaneously help to represent the rich patterns of intercon-

nectivity between various lexical properties and facilitate the realization of a multifunctional LR that both

possesses powerful search capabilities and can be utilized by a wide range of users. Section 4 also outlines

the extraction and formal encoding of a major corpus-based lexicon essential for constructing the LR. Section

5 recaps the main points and briefly discusses future work for the larger LR project.

2 Ontology as conceptual framework

After some general comments about defining ontologies, this section also briefly introduces the two models

for LRs that we specifically draw inspiration from in constructing the JLP-O; namely, the lemon model

(lexical model for ontologies; http://lemon-model.net/) and Spohr’s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.

2.1 General comments

Although Gruber’s (1993; 199) immensely influential pronouncement that an “ontology is an explicit specifi-

cation of a conceptualization” continues to provide the basic template, following Guarino (1998) and Guarino

et al. (2009), many subsequent definitions of ontologies tend to also emphasize the shared nature of the con-

ceptualization (Guarino et al., 2009; Prévot et al., 2010). The elements of this ontology definition require a

little unpacking. First, conceptualization refers to both the explicit and implicit knowledge about a system

or entity, such as its component entities and their relations. Next, explicit, or formal, specification refers to

a commitment to encode the body of knowledge in the form of some representation language, usually in a

machine-readable format. And, finally, shared conceptualization refers to the criterion that, to have value,

there should be a general consensus among interested parties about the target conceptualization (Guarino et

al., 2009; Prévot et al., 2010).

As already suggested, our approach towards ontology construction is admittedly somewhat nuanced in

nature, reflecting a basic tension at the conceptual level. While we fully concur with the laudable drive to-

wards clearer descriptions of phenomena that ontology construction entails, we are equally cautious of seeing

ontologies alone as some magical panacea for all knowledge representation problems. The sentiment is par-

ticularly visceral in the case of natural systems like language which abounds in various forms of redundancy

and biases that are not readily represented by ontologies. Thus, in our efforts to construct a comprehensive

model of the Japanese lexicon, we are endeavoring to incorporate vital aspects of linguistic and cognitive

knowledge that are embedded within its diverse lexical properties. However, at the pragmatic level, we

acutely recognize the numerous benefits of adopting the ontology as a conceptual framework for effectively

realizing the overall research objective of constructing a large-scale LR database of Japanese lexical proper-

ties. In some ways, our qualified position on ontology construction is rather aptly captured in the following

comments from Franconi, Kerhet, and Ngo (2013):

An ontology provides a conceptual view of the database and it is composed by constraints on a

vocabulary extending the basic vocabulary of the data. Querying a database using the terms in such

a richer ontology allows for more flexibility than using only the basic vocabulary of the relational

database directly.

2.2 Models for linguistic resources

For the sake of clarity (albeit at some risk of possibly overstating what may already be sufficiently obvi-

ous), our primary objective in constructing the JLP-O is to have a conceptual view, or framework, to aid the

development of a large-scale LR database with multifunctional querying capabilities, which we hope will

come to serve as a comprehensive model of the Japanese lexicon. That is to say, we are seeking to apply

175



linguistic, psycholinguistic and cognitive conceptualizations about Japanese words in order to realize a for-

mal specification of the Japanese lexicon. This naturally brings into focus the next vital piece in the puzzle;

namely, the need for an ontology model that is particularly suitable for linguistic resources, where linguistic

and psycholinguistic conceptualizations (lexical properties) are linked to the lexical entries (words) of the

database. Although a number of candidate models exist, such as LexInfo (Cimiano, Buitelaar, McCrae, &

Sintek, 2011), LIR (Linguistic Information Repository; Peters, Montiel-Ponsoda, & Cea, 2007) and LMF

(Lexical Markup Framework; Francopoulo, 2013), the present work draws inspiration most directly from the

lemon model and Spohr’s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs.

Building directly on the LexInfo, LIR and LMF models, lemon has been specifically developed to be a

standard for the exchange of lexical information on the semantic web, and so it has a number of advantages

that are particularly appealing for JLP-O. These include the facts that lemon is based on RDF, a semantic web

standard that can greatly facilitate the representation of links between parts of the LR, and that, reflecting its

policy not to prescribe over linguistics definitions, lemon effectively delegates the burdens of constraining

domain-specific information to external sources, such as WordNet and ontologies of linguistic descriptions

such as GOLD (General Ontology for Linguistic Description; http://linguistics-ontology.org/). Other advan-

tages are that lemon is relatively concise, because it requires few classes and relies on external definitions,

and that it is organized in terms of a number of separate modules, which can be constructed independently

for greater flexibility. In contrast, reflecting its emergence from the intersection between semantic web tech-

nology and lexicography, Spohr’s (2012) model for multifunctional LRs is particularly concerned with the

informational needs of diverse users, encompassing both humans (from monolinguals, bilinguals, novices,

to linguistic experts) and NLP applications, and with realizing suitable query and display interfaces. As the

goal of achieving a high degree of multifunctionality, in Spohr’s sense of the notion, is also central to our LR

project, we particularly take to heart Spohr’s suggestion that one vital key for realizing multifunctionality is

the incorporation of an appropriate typology, or range, of lexical entries.

3 Construction concerns

This section briefly sketches out the twomajor issues for constructing the JLP-O; namely, appropriately struc-

turing the wide range of lexical properties associated with the Japanese lexicon and determining a suitable

range of lexical entries. The solutions incorporated into JLP-O’s RDF representation are discussed further in

section 4.

3.1 Range of Japanese lexical properties

For researchers within the language and cognitive sciences to be able conduct significant research on various

aspects of the Japanese language, such as developing more robust models and simulations of linguistic and

cognitive abilities, obviously, access to a wide range of information about the contemporary Japanese lexicon

is absolutely essential. Traditionally, available LRs have been limited to various kinds of dictionaries, such as

language dictionaries like Shinmura’s (2008) Kōjien and Kindaiichi et al.’s (2011) Shinmeikai Kokugojiten

and character dictionaries like Morohashi’s (2000) Daikanwajiten. However, as dictionaries rarely provide

much summary information beyond headword counts, researchers have also had to rely on scarce sources of

data summaries. Hayashi’s (1982) Zūsetsu Nihongo is a classic example that included a lexical section, with

some frequency, word class and formation information, an orthographic section, with some counts, usage and

readings information for kanji in particular, as well as sections on phonology and accent, grammar, and style.

Setting aside genuine issues for keeping such data up-to-date, however, a particularly serious problem is the

tremendous expansion in the range of lexical properties that researchers require data about today. One helpful

way to understand the variety of lexical properties is in terms of Nation’s (2001/2013) aspects of knowing a

word. Highly influential in the areas of vocabulary research and second language acquisition, his framework

consists of nine broad types of word knowledge grouped under threemain categories of form (spoken, written,

and word parts), meaning (form and meaning, concept and referent, and associations) and use (grammatical

functions, collocations, and constraints on use (such as register and frequency)). In addition to the breadth

dimension, it is also useful to think about the considerable range of lexical properties in terms of the depths of

analyses conducted within these various domains. For instance, taking just the domain of visual word recog-

176



nition experiments to illustrate, Adelman (2012) recently notes 14 kinds of potentially confounding lexical

variables that should be controlled for, including frequency and contextual diversity data, various forms of

neighborhoods (orthographic, phonological, phonographic, and Levenshtein-distance), spelling-sound regu-

larities and consistencies, length, morphological properties as well as rating-based measures. While granting

that some of these form-related lexical properties will undoubtedly also be of interest to researchers in other

areas, still, equally undeniably, they will also require information about many other lexical properties, such

as semantic properties of denotation and semantic groups of thesauri, or usage information, such as valencies,

collocations and associations, and educational levels.

In addition to facilitating the integration and ongoing maintenance of the large-scale LR, we see the con-

struction of the JLP-O as being especially valuable for helping to elucidate divergent interpretations about

lexical properties. For instance, regardless of the markedly different theoretical motivations underlying or-

thographic neighborhoods and morphological families, LRs of kanji compound neighborhoods and LRs of

morphological families yield identical data, at least, with respect to the possible two-compound word combi-

nations for a given set of kanji. Awareness of such data equivalencies despite contrasting ontological perspec-

tives is vital both for realizing robust queries of the LR and, in turn, for developing more robust simulations

and models.

3.2 UniDic’s short-unit words

For a research project aiming to construct a large-scale LR that can serve as a comprehensive model of the

Japanese lexicon, one of the thorniest issues that must be addressed is surely just what to treat as the core

entities within the LR database in the case of a highly agglutinative language like Japanese where word

boundaries are often ambiguous. While doubting that an ideal solution exists, given that any decision is

certain to have broad implications for implementing a LR, the issue must be taken seriously.

In this context, it is illustrative to look at UniDic; the electronic morphological dictionary for the Japanese

language that was developed as part of the BCCWJ project. Reflecting its objectives to be a high-performance

dictionary for wide coverage of contemporary written Japanese, UniDic adopted as its prime entity the so-

called short-unit word (SUW), which roughly corresponds to the shortest meaningful unit, the morpheme.

However, although that decision is certainly not without some justification, as Joyce, Hodošček and Nishina

(2012) discuss, it is also fair to say that the SUW is far from convenient for human users, unless additional in-

formation about higher-order groupings is also readily available. Although the BCCWJ project’s provision of

supplementary information in the form of annotations about so-called long-unit words (LUWs)—groupings

of verb and adjective agglutinations and compound nouns as single units—probably originates from this is-

sue, still, the distinction is somewhat artificial and requires a certain degree of familiarity. Figure 1 highlights

the basic relationships between UniDic’s SUWs and LUWs, with an example sentence of報告書を読み始

める /hōkokusho o yomihajimeru/ ‘to begin reading a report (document)’ consisting of three LUWs. The

two content LUWs of 報告書/hōkokusho/ ‘report (document)’ and 読み始める /yomihajimeru/ ‘to begin

reading’ are both combinations of two SUWs, while case-marking particles, like the object markerを/o/, are

simultaneously both SUWs and LUWs.

While again acknowledging that any proposals about what to treat as core lexical entries within a LR of

the Japanese lexicon are likely to involve some degree of compromise, still one obvious lesson to emerge

from referring to the UniDic case is that a single lexical unit alone is insufficient in order to handle all items

of the Japanese lexicon adequately for all kinds of users. As outlined further in section 4.2, our solution for

JLP-O is to specify a wider range of lexical entries. However, despite the problems of SUWs and LUWs

associated with the BCCWJ, it is an authoritative sampling of the contemporary Japanese lexicon, consisting

of approximately 100 million words. Accordingly, it unquestionably remains the most valuable source from

which to extract a corpus-based lexicon, with information about numerous core lexical properties, including

lemma and orthographic specification, their respective frequencies, their phonological information and word

classes, to establish a solid foundation to the construction of the large-scale LR project.

4 JLP-O construction

Having touched on the extensive range of Japanese lexical properties and the inherent tensions involved in

selecting a range of lexical entry classes, this section turns to explain how these concerns have been handled

in constructing the current version of the JLP-O. The section also outlines the extraction of the BCCWJ-based

lexicon and the assignment of JLP-O’s LexicalEntry subclasses as a foundation for the LR.

4.1 JLP-O modules

Although a number of separate Japanese LRs have already been created to address various lexical properties,

given that they have been developed with different objectives and with diverging interpretations about the

lexical properties themselves, their treatments of key properties, such as phonological, orthographic or se-

mantic information, are not always consistent across resources, which can also vary greatly in terms of their

levels of coverage. In order to help remedy this situation, the overall aim of our research project is to create

a single comprehensive LR by constructing the JLP-O as its core framework to facilitate the integration of

existing LRs.

Some of the initial groundwork for the LR project is outlined by Joyce, Masuda, and Ogawa (2014), within

the context of discussing the revised jōyō kanji list as the core building block of the Japanese writing system.

In addition to identifying and organizing a number of lexical properties at the jōyō kanji character level, they

also describe a new analysis of the components of jōyō and JIS1 kanji, and apply an initial orthographic coding

to the corpus word lists created in Joyce et al. (2012). Building directly from that, our continuing investiga-

tions of lexical properties have already identified 65 important properties; although, naturally, we fully expect

the number to expand still further as additional LRs are consulted and examined for their particular merits.

Reflecting both their natural mutual relationships and the need to structure their representations within the

LR, these properties have also been organized under six modules of character, orthographic, phonological,

morphological, semantic, and use. These are presented in Table 1 with a few examples of the relevant lexical

properties.

Modules Example properties

Character type, configuration, internal structure, stroke counts, status, references, …

Orthographic representation, variations, length (in characters), neighborhood data, …

Phonological stress, length (in mora), CV structures, homophones, neighborhoods, consistency, …

Morphological word structure, family data (size/frequency), constituent analysis, transparency, …

Semantic denotation, connotations, sense range, lexical stratum, groups, concreteness, relations,…

Use frequency/familiarity data, collocations, grammatical patterns, genre/register/style, …

Table 1: The six modules of the JLP-O with examples of relevant lexical properties.

This structuring of the lexical properties is highly consistent with lemon’s modular design, which includes

five modules in its core: linguistic description, variation, phrase structure, syntax and mapping, and mor-

phology. We are, therefore, able to utilize a great deal of lemon’s basic descriptive infrastructure pretty much

intact, albeit with some relabeling of module names and some element reallocations to conform to JLP-O’s

178



modularization of lexical properties. For example, much of lemon’s syntax and mapping module could be

used with only minimal label changes in the integration of LRs such as Japanese versions ofWordNet (Isahara

et al., 2012) and FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2004) to JLP-O’s semantic and use modules, respectively. In con-

trast, however, some basic characteristics of the Japanese lexicon, such as unit size issues and more extensive

levels of orthographic variation, necessitate more expressive alternatives to both lemon’s variation module

and the decomposition property within the phrase structure module. Given these clear parallels, however, we

believe that lemon’s notion of modules is the most effective approach to structuring the lexical properties and

to realizing their complex mappings to the range of lexical entries within our LR.

4.2 JLP-O’s core range of lexical entries

As noted in subsection 3.2, one of the thorniest concerns to address in constructing a large-scale LR of the

Japanese lexicon is to determine a suitable range of lexical entries to use as the core entities of the database.

The issue is certainly far from straightforward, because it involves finding a workable compromise between

a set of conflicting constraints. Naturally, these include the highly agglutinative nature of the Japanese lan-

guage itself, which, understandably, encourages a focus towards the smallest components. However, these

constraints also include the needs of diverse users of the LR, where, in contrast, as Spohr (2012) convincingly

argues, a wider range is preferable for enhancing the search capabilities of an LR. At its heart, however, the

issue is primarily about representation, or formal specification, given that the complex relationships between

lexical entries themselves and between lexical entries and themodules of lexical properties must be efficiently

captured within the JLP-O.

However, on consulting with our two reference models for LRs for guidance, we discover that they

adopt radically different approaches to the specification of lexical entries. Consistent with its aspirations

to be concise, lemon specifies just three classes of lexical entries; namely, Part, Word and Phrase.
While this rather minimalist level of specification is, arguably, not so dissimilar to the de facto distinc-

tion that emerges with UniDic between SUWs and LUWs, comparisons quickly break down on closer in-

spection. For example, SUWs cover both bound morphemes (affixes and particles) and free morphemes

(simple words), but these would correspond to lemon’s part and word classes, respectively. The LUW con-

cept also fails to fit nicely with lemon’s tripartite division. Given that LUWs are either polymorphemic

words or compound words formed by combining SUWs, the unit does not extend to phrases which are

not marked by UniDic. In sharp contrast, but also consistent with his goal of multifunctionality, Spohr’s

MLR model incorporates a highly detailed typology of lexical entries (lexemes). Although the upper-

level division into BoundUnit, FreeUnit, and Clitic may not, at first glance, appear so different, the
subsequent divisions of BoundUnit into BoundStem and Affix (further divided into 9 kinds) and of
FreeUnit into Idiom, Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit, and Syntactically-SimpleFreeUnit
(of which the final two are further divided eventually into 17 and 11 subclasses, respectively) clearly demon-

strate very different theoretical motivations and objectives. That noted, however, the distinction between

Syntactically-SimpleFreeUnit and Syntactically-ComplexFreeUnit parallels more closely to
the contrast between SUWs and LUWs.

Aiming for a realistic balance between the constraints afforded by the characteristics of the Japanese lex-

icon, the LR’s ambitions to realize a high degree of multifunctionality, and the need to achieve an accept-

able degree of formal specification concerning the relationships among lexical entries and the six modules

of lexical properties, the solution that we adopt for JLP-O is closer in spirit to the upper-levels of Spohr’s

(2012) typology of lexeme subclasses. More specifically, as illustrated in Table 2, we specify for JLP-O

five classes of LexicalEntry, which are Character, BoundUnit, SimpleWord, ComplexWord, and
MultiWordExpression. Thus, while the basic entities of the JLP-O draws inspiration more directly from
Spohr’s typology of lexeme classes, the range of JLP-O lexical entries has been increased in order to more

faithfully represent the nature of the Japanese lexicon.

4.3 Extraction and RDF encoding of corpus lexicon

Having identified our practical solutions, this section briefly outlines their implementation in the RDF encod-

ing. First, the current version of the JLP-O was specified by extending lemon’s OWL specification using the

Protégé ontology editor (http://protege.stanford.edu/). Second, a program was executed to simultaneously

179



Lexical entry type Examples of units included

Character kanji (仮), hiragana (か), katakana (カ), rōmaji (KA), …
BoundUnit prefixes (御—), suffixes (—的), auxiliary verbs (—れる), …
SimpleWord nouns (報告), verbs (読む), particles (を), adjectives (詳しい), …
ComplexWord nouns (報告書), verbs (読み始める), adjectives (詳しくない), …
MultiWordExpression collocations, idioms

Table 2: Examples of lexical entries.

extract the corpus lexicon from the BCCWJ corpus and assign the appropriate LexicalEntry subclasses.
In addition to replacing lemon’s three classes of lexical entries with JLP-O’s five LexicalEntry sub-

classes, two further minor extensions to the structure and facilities provided by the lemon model have also

been necessary. The first minor extension relates to the high levels of orthographic variation that exists within

the Japanese lexicon, as evidenced in Joyce et al. (2012), which is far beyond that envisioned by either lemon

or Spohr’s models. In seeking to be more consistent with UniDic’s basic distinction between an abstract

lemma form and all orthographic variations of a Japanese word, we have somewhat expanded upon lemon’s

distinction between canonicalForm and otherForm, by retaining the first label for the lemma form and
changing the otherForm label to orthographicForm for each orthographic variant of a word. The second
minor expansion is to more extensively utilize lemon’s decomposition object property (which in lemon is

limited to specifying the decomposition of phrases into parts). Thus, apart from the Character subclass
within the current JLP-O (compositional analysis of radicals is not fully implemented at present), all lexical

entry classes have a decomposition object property; such that both BoundUnit and SimpleWord en-
tries are decomposed into one or more Characters, while the orthographicForms of ComplexWord and
MultiWordExpression entries are decomposed into the relevant orthographicForms of BoundUnits
and SimpleWords. By adopting this approach to linking structures, it is possible to search for complex lexi-
cal entries based on lower-level components, such as characters, by traversing the implemented hierarchical

structure. Figure 2 shows a part of the lexical model with a focus on the lexical entries.

In order to extract the corpus lexicon, a program was written to convert the SUW and LUW infor-

mation from the BCCWJ corpus into the JLP-O’s RDF format, including the appropriate assignment of

LexicalEntry subclasses. The M-XML format of the BCCWJ (version 1) includes basic structural en-
codings of LUWs in the form of lists of component SUWs. First, SUWs were assigned as either BoundUnit
or SimpleWord lexical entries based on their unique identifier, which consists of the unique combination
of the lemma and the POS category. Next, all orthographic variations of the lexical entry (based on their

shared identifier) were recorded within the single entry specification using the orthographicForm object
property, together with their decompositions into lists of characters. Finally, the frequency counts for or-

thographic variants were recorded using the use object property, allowing us to specify frequency counts
together with their sources, which in the present case is a corpus identifier but could also specify a particular

genre or style. The total frequency count, as sum of all orthographicForm variants, was also recorded
under the canonicalForm property.
Figure 3 shows part of the RDF encoding in Turtle format for the SimpleWord lexical entry for the verb

読む /yomu/ ‘to read’. For the sake of brevity, it is not possible to display all 12 orthographic variants, but

the figure includes the three most frequent; the standard kanji-kana mixed orthography (of verbal stem and

inflectional ending), the hiragana-orthography representation ofよむ, and a kanji variation of詠む with the

nuances of ‘to read or recite poetry; chant’.

Similarly, Figure 4 presents part of the RDF encoding in Turtle format for the SimpleWord lexical entry
of the verb 始める /hajimeru/ ‘to begin’. Interestingly, 始める is the verb2 element of many verb1-verb2

compounds that express senses of ‘to begin V1’.

Finally, the extraction program also assigned LUWs to the ComplexWord subclass. The process essentially
mirrored the extraction of BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries, except that links under the decom-
position object property link back to its constituent BoundUnit or SimpleWord lexical entries. Figure 5
presents part of the ComplexWord lexical entry for読み始める /yomihajimeru/ ‘to begin to read’, which is

a verb1-verb2 compound type consisting of読み conjugation of読む (verb1) together with始める (verb2).

We executed the extraction and RDF encoding program to enumerate the BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon

according to the JLP-O’s core LexicalEntry classes. As summarized in Table 3, approximately 2.7 million
lexical entries were assigned to the four core LexicalEntry classes.

Lexical entry Types Tokens

Characters 6,761 195,500,491
BoundUnit 433 11,327,729
SimpleWord 195,380 112,557,387
ComplexWord 2,438,506 101,684,786

Table 3: Type and token counts for the BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon.

The number of lexical entries assigned to the Character subclass is highly consistent with encoding spec-
ifications for Japanese characters. Similarly, the relatively smaller number of BoundUnit lexical entries is
also consistent with the fact that this class consists of a small number of closed word classes, such as parti-

cles and the relatively limited sets of affixes. In contrast, the much higher counts for the SimpleWord and
ComplexWord classes obviously reflect in largemeasure the fact that these cover themajor openword classes,
and, in particular, the noun class, which is extremely open. Another closely related factor is that these lexical

entries also include vast numbers of proper nouns, which is a particular feature of large corpus data. The sub-

stantial difference between the SimpleWord and ComplexWord classes clearly illustrates the agglutinative
nature of the Japanese language with rich verbal and adjectival conjugations and productive compounding.

However, also a characteristic of large corpus data, it should also be noted that approximately 66% of the

ComplexWord lexical entries occur only once within the BCCWJ corpus. And, a natural corollary is that
while the ComplexWord lexical entries are on average decomposed into 3.1 BoundUnit and SimpleWord
lexical entries, 94% of these have only one orthographic variant (because, for extremely low frequency words,

one obviously requires even larger corpora to capture all possible orthographic variations). A final observa-

tion to make is that the corpus lexicon does not yield any lexical entries under the MultiWordExpressions
subclass; although it would be feasible to extract collocational data from the BCCWJ, these will be identified

for the large-scale LR in the future in the course of integrating other LRs.

5 Conclusion

As a principal component of a larger research project to construct a large-scale LR database concerned with

the lexical and psycholinguistic properties associated with the Japanese lexicon, the paper has described the

construction of the ontology of Japanese lexical properties (JLP-O) as its working conceptual framework.

More specifically, the paper focused on two important issues. After outlining the first concern of mapping

out and organizing the wide range of lexical and psycholinguistic properties that linguistic and cognitive

science researchers require up-to-date information about in section 3.1, section 4.1 detailed how these are

being structured under six modules, which mirrors the flexible approach towards construction employed

by lemon. Similarly, after outlining the second difficult concern of what to treat as core entities of the LR

database in section 3.2, section 4.2 explained the reason behind our solution to recognize five LexicalEntry
classes, namely, that a wider range of classes is key to achieving the high degree of multifunctionality that

our LR project aspires to (Spohr, 2012). Section 4.3 also outlined the extraction and RDF encoding of the

BCCWJ-based corpus lexicon. Classified according to the JLP-O’s range of lexical entries, and supplemented

with information about orthographic variations, decompositions and frequencies, the corpus lexicon provides

solid foundations for the large-scale project to construct the comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties.

Although we are fully aware that it will be necessary to further develop and refine the JLP-O as the larger

LR project progresses, as the present working version has been constructed to specifically handle two fun-

damental aspects about the Japanese lexicon, we believe that it represents a sufficiently robust conceptual

framework that can guide future work of integrating existing LRs. Thus, we approach the integration task

not merely as a mechanical process of expanding the LR database by merging data, but as a dialectic one

183



that requires ongoing consideration and investigation of the theoretical adequacies and psychological reali-

ties of candidate lexical properties; a reflective process that is exemplified by ontology construction. And, as

a working conceptual framework for examining the LR database, the JLP-O represents the kind of architec-

tural blueprint of the structural relationships within the LR database that is essential for realizing high degrees

of multifunctionality in terms of developing various interfaces for search queries and data presentation. In

this way, we hope to realize a comprehensive LR of Japanese lexical properties that will be beneficial as a

systematic model of the Japanese lexicon that can be effectively mined in the pursuit of deeper insights into

lexical knowledge.
