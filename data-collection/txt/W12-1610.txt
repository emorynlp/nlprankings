Abstract

Recent work on consultations between out-
patients with schizophrenia and psychiatrists
has shown that adherence to treatment can
be predicted by patterns of repair – specifi-
cally, the pro-activity of the patient in check-
ing their understanding, i.e. patient clarifi-
cation. Using machine learning techniques,
we investigate whether this tendency can be
predicted from high-level dialogue features,
such as backchannels, overlap and each partic-
ipant’s proportion of talk. The results indicate
that these features are not predictive of a pa-
tient’s adherence to treatment or satisfaction
with the communication, although they do
have some association with symptoms. How-
ever, all these can be predicted if we allow
features at the word level. These preliminary
experiments indicate that patient adherence is
predictable from dialogue transcripts, but fur-
ther work is necessary to develop a meaning-
ful, general and reliable feature set.

1 Introduction

How conversational partners achieve and maintain
shared understanding is of crucial importance in
the understanding of dialogue. One such mecha-
nism, other initiated repair (Schegloff, 1992), where
one conversational participant queries or corrects
the talk of another, has been well documented in
both general and task-based dialogues (Colman and
Healey, 2011). However, how such shared under-
standing impacts beyond the level of the conversa-
tion has not typically been examined. Exceptions to

this have highlighted the role of shared understand-
ing in schizophrenia (McCabe et al., 2002; Themis-
tocleous et al., 2009) and the association between
psychiatrist-patient communication and adherence.
McCabe et al. (in preparation) found that more pa-
tient clarification (i.e. other initiated repair) of the
psychiatrist’s talk was associated with better treat-
ment adherence six months later. Clarification con-
sists mainly of asking questions to clarify the mean-
ing of the psychiatrist’s utterance (checking under-
standing) and correcting something that the psychi-
atrist has said (getting the facts straight). Example 1,
taken from a consultation, shows the patient request-
ing clarification of something the psychiatrist has
just said about a possible side effect.

(1) Dr: Yep, well that is a possible side effect
Pat: Side effect?
Dr: Of the er haloperidol

The patient’s request leads to additional explana-
tion by the psychiatrist about the medication which
can cause the possible side effect. More patient clar-
ification reflects greater effort to reach a shared un-
derstanding. McCabe et al. (in preparation) found
that for each unit increase in the patient clarification
factor,1 the odds of good (versus poor) adherence
were increased by 5.8 (95% CI 1.3 to 25.8, p=0.02).

Explaining the link between communicative pat-
terns of patients and adherence may create the pos-
sibility for new interventions to improve adherence,
and has both clinical and theoretical implications.

ifcations (as in e.g. 1).

However, there is no evidence regarding what fac-
tors influence patient clarification and may explain
the link with adherence. If patient clarification is
a measure of greater communicational effort, or en-
gagement, then we might expect other dialogue mea-
sures, such as the amount of acknowledgements or
other grounding cues (Traum and Allen, 1992), or
the proportion of talk per person, to be correlated
with other initiated repair and therefore similarly
predictive of subsequent adherence behaviour. This
is of particular importance if we wish to build a sys-
tem to automatically predict possible (lack of) ad-
herence from dialogue transcripts, especially given
that the types of patient clarification which carry
the highest weight in the patient clarification factor
(next-turn repair initiators, Schegloff, 1992) are rare,
occurring on average only 1.2 times per dialogue.

Further, although certain types of repair were
shown to affect how patients reported they felt the
conversation went, self-reports of symptoms and
communicational factors are not predictive of adher-
ence. Although micro-communicational behaviour
(in the form of other initiated repair) does have a
bearing on subsequent adherence behaviour, patients
are unaware of this. Additional questions therefore
concern whether we can predict patient’s symptom
levels and subjective analyses of the communication
based only on overview dialogue factors.

2 Hypotheses

Factors which we would expect to index patient en-
gagement, and thus be predictive of adherence to
treatment are the amount of backchannel responses
patients make, and the proportion of questions pa-
tients ask, both of which ought to be higher for the
more engaged patients. We might also expect that
such patients have a greater proportion of the talk
overall, and/or longer turns on average, though note
that this conversational pattern might also be one in
which the patient is not engaged, as they might not
be responding to the feedback from their consultant.

For the symptom scores (see below for details),
we should expect that patients with high levels
of negative symptoms (which includes loss of af-
fect and poverty of speech) would produce less
talk overall, and in general produce shorter turns.
There should also be more noticeable gaps in the

dialogues (defined as greater than approximately
200ms, (Heldner and Edlund, 2010)). Contrarily,
for positive symptoms, (including hallucinations and
delusions) patients ought to produce longer turns
and have a greater proportion of the talk.

We also expect to see effects on how patients felt
the conversation went from the amount of overlap,
though as overlap can be both intended and inter-
preted as either interruptive or collaborative (as with
e.g. overlapping backchannels) it is unclear which
direction such a prediction should take.

3 Method

131 dialogues from outpatient consultations be-
tween patients and psychiatrists were analysed ac-
cording to a number of factors. Each of these fac-
tors, detailed in table 1, below, is calculated for each
dialogue participant (with the exception of pauses).
Each patient featured in only one of the dialogues
however, there were only 29 doctors in the study,
so the same clinician may have featured in several
of the dialogues with different patients. The con-
sultations varied in length, with the shortest con-
sisting of 61 turns (438 words) and the longest
881 turns (13178 words), with an average of 320.5
turns (2706.4 words). In addition, a third party was
present in 47 of the consultations.

Following the consultation, each patient was
asked questions from standard questionnaires to as-
certain their level of symptoms, and their evalua-
tion of aspects of the consultation. The positive
and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) (Kay et al.,
1987) assesses positive, negative and general symp-
toms on a 7-point scale of severity (1=absent – 7=ex-
treme). Positive symptoms represent a change in
the patients’ behaviour or thoughts and include sen-
sory hallucinations and delusional beliefs. Negative
symptoms represent a withdrawal or reduction in
functioning, including blunted affect, and emotional
withdrawal and alogia (poverty of speech). Positive
and negative subscale scores ranged from 7 (absent)
– 49 (extreme), general symptoms (such as anxiety)
scores ranged from 16 (absent) – 112 (extreme).

Patient satisfaction with the communication was
assessed using the Patient Experience Questionnaire
(PEQ) (Steine et al., 2001). Three of the five sub-
scales (12 questions) were used as the others were

80



not relevant, having been developed for primary
care. The three subscales were ‘communication ex-
periences’, ‘communication barriers’ and ‘emotions
immediately after the visit’. For the communication
subscales, items were measured on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale, with 1=disagree completely and 5=agree
completely. The four items for the emotion scale
were measured on a 7-point visual analogue scale,
with opposing emotions were at either end. A higher
score indicates a better experience.

Adherence to treatment was rated by the clini-
cians as good (> 75%), average (25� 75%) or poor
(< 25%) six months after the consultation. Due to
the low incidence of poor ratings (only 8 dialogues),
this was converted to a binary score of 1 for good ad-
herence (91 patients), and 0 otherwise (37). Ratings
were not available for the remaining dialogues.

3.1 Classification Experiments
We performed a series of classification experiments
using the Weka machine learning toolkit (Hall et
al., 2009) to predict each of the outcome mea-
sures outlined above (symptom measures, satisfac-
tion measures, and adherence to treatment). In each
case, outcome measures were converted to binary
high/low scores on an equal frequency basis (i.e.

providing approximately equal numbers of high and
low instances). Features used were the high-level
measures given in Table 1, and/or all unigrams ex-
tracted from the transcript; in both cases, features
from doctor and patient were treated separately. Un-
igrams were produced by tokenising the lower-cased
transcripts on white space; no stemming or stop-
word removal was performed, and feature values
were binary i.e. indicating only presence or ab-
sence of the word spoken by the given speaker in
the given dialogue.2 Given the small size of our
dataset (131 instances) and the large feature space
resulting (> 6500 features), we selected features
based on their predictive ability across the entire
dataset (using Weka’s CfsSubsetEval selector), re-
ducing the number of features to 50-100. In order
to avoid biasing towards doctor-specific features, we
used only words spoken by patients in these exper-
iments – each patient only features in one dialogue,
so patient-specific vocabulary cannot help perfor-
mance across dialogues. All unigram features thus
selected were used in at least 3 dialogues.3

4 Results

Experiments including unigram features used Lib-
SVM’s support vector machine implementation
(Chang and Lin, 2001) with a radial basis func-
tion kernel; experiments with only high-level fea-
tures used J48 decision trees. In each case, experi-
ments used 5-fold cross-validation.4 In experiments
predicting adherence, the distribution between pos-
itive and negative (i.e. good and bad adherence)
made it impossible to balance the dataset - as this
can be problematic for decision tree classifiers, we
also present results for a downsampled dataset with
only 71 instances but which provides balance. Per-
formance is shown in Table 2 as overall percentage
accuracy, and is compared to a majority-class base-
line throughout; results which are significantly dif-
ferent at the 5% level according to a �2 test from a

2Experiments with frequency counts did not affect the re-
sults as reported.

3Bi- and tri-gram features were not extracted from this data
because of the small amount of data available which we felt
would result in models that suffered from overfitting (note that
the same concern holds for the unigram features).

combination so as to test the whole dataset.

Adherence (balanced) 53.5 93.0* 52.1

Table 2: Percentage accuracies vs feature set

Results show good performance for all experi-
ments when including lexical features, with all fac-
tors being predictable with around 90% accuracy
with the exception of PEQ communication at just be-
low 80%. However, using high-level features alone
gives negligible performance, except for a small
benefit on the PANSS negative and positive symp-
tom measures, though contrary to our hypotheses
the most important high-level features were OCR-
PerWord by the doctor (negative) and WhWords by
an other participant (positive).

Examination of the most predictive unigrams
shows that sets selected for different outcome mea-
sures are different: for example, the 54 fea-
tures selected for adherence and the 73 selected
for PEQ overall have only 1 word in com-
mon (“mates”). Adherence-related words in-
clude words related to conditions, treatment and
medication (“schizophrenic”, “sickness”, “symp-
toms”, “worse”, “pains”, “flashbacks”, “sodium”,
“chemical”, “monthly”); PEQ-related words in-
clude those related to personal life (“sundays”,
“thursdays”, “television”, “sofa”, “wine”, “per-
sonally”, “played”), and filled pauses (“eerrmm”,
“uhhm”) – although more investigation is required
to draw any firm conclusions from these. Table 3
shows the full lists for adherence and PEQ overall.

5 Discussion and Conclusions

The results show that although we can weakly pre-
dict symptoms at levels above chance using only
high-level dialogue factors, we cannot do so for ad-
herence, or satisfaction measures. Despite the link

between patient other initiated repair and adherence,
this is also not an effective predictor for our machine
learning approach because of the scarcity of the phe-
nomenon, and the fact that many of the consulta-
tions for which the patients subsequently exhibited
good adherence behaviour do not feature a single
patient clarification, which may be linked to psychi-
atrist clarity rather than lack of effort or engagement
on the patient’s part.

The high accuracies with lexical features show
that some aspects of the consultations do enable ac-
curate prediction of adherence, PEQ measures and
symptoms. However, as the features which allow us
to achieve such good results rely on specific words
used, it is unclear how generalisable or interpretable
such results are. The lexical features chosen do gen-
eralise over our dataset (in which individual patients
appear only once), and exclude doctor talk, so can-
not be simply picking out unique unigram signatures
relating to individual patients or doctors; however,
given the small size of the dataset used for this ini-
tial investigation with its constrained domain, genre
and topics, and the use of the whole dataset to select
predictive words, it is unclear whether these results
will scale up to a larger dataset.

We therefore suspect that more general, higher-
level dialogue features such as specific interac-
tion phenomena (repair, question-answering) and/or
more general models of topic may be required.
While unigrams are too low-level to be explanatory
and may not generalise, the dialogue features dis-
cussed are too high-level to be useful; we are there-
fore examining mid-level phenomena and models
to capture the predictability while remaining gen-
eral and providing more interpretable features and
results. Although the word lists offer clues as to
the relevance of specific words for the overall pre-
dictability, we would not like to leave it at that.
Further experiments are therefore underway to in-
vestigate whether we can find a level of appropri-
ate explanatory power and maximal predictivity us-
ing an interim level of analysis, for example with n-
gram and part-of-speech-based models, topic mod-
els based on word distributions, and turn-taking phe-
nomena. Additional experiments also look at the
turn-level data to see if the patient led clarification
factor can be directly extracted from the transcripts.
