Abstract

While there have been many attempts to
estimate the emotion of an addresser from
her/his utterance, few studies have ex-
plored how her/his utterance affects the
emotion of the addressee. This has mo-
tivated us to investigate two novel tasks:
predicting the emotion of the addressee
and generating a response that elicits a
specific emotion in the addressee’s mind.
We target Japanese Twitter posts as a
source of dialogue data and automatically
build training data for learning the pre-
dictors and generators. The feasibility of
our approaches is assessed by using 1099
utterance-response pairs that are built by
five human workers.

1 Introduction

When we have a conversation, we usually care
about the emotion of the person to whom we
speak. For example, we try to cheer her/him up
if we find out s/he feels down, or we avoid saying
things that would trouble her/him.

To date, the modeling of emotion in a dialogue
has extensively been studied in NLP as well as re-
lated areas (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004; Ayadi
et al., 2011). However, the past attempts are vir-
tually restricted to estimating the emotion of an
addresser1 from her/his utterance. In contrast, few
studies have explored how the emotion of the ad-
dressee is affected by the utterance. We consider
the insufficiency of such research to be fatal for

graduate student at the University of Tokyo.

speaker/listener, because we target not spoken but online di-
alogue.

I have had a high fever for 3 days.

JOY

I hope you feel better soon.

I have had a high fever for 3 days.

SADNESS

Sorry, but you can’t join us today.

who receives the response.

computers to support human-human communica-
tions or to provide a communicative man-machine
interface.

With this motivation in mind, the paper inves-
tigates two novel tasks: (1) prediction of the ad-
dressee’s emotion and (2) generation of the re-
sponse that elicits a prespecified emotion in the ad-
dressee’s mind.2 In the prediction task, the system
is provided with a dialogue history. For simplic-
ity, we consider, as a history, an utterance and a
response to it (Figure 1). Given the history, the
system predicts the addressee’s emotion that will
be caused by the response. For example, the sys-
tem outputs JOY when the response is I hope you
feel better soon, while it outputs SADNESS when
the response is Sorry, but you can’t join us today

2We adopt Plutchik (1980)’s eight emotional categories in
both tasks.

(Figure 1).
In the generation task, on the other hand, the

system is provided with an utterance and an emo-
tional category such as JOY or SADNESS, which is
referred to as goal emotion. Then the system gen-
erates the response that elicits the goal emotion in
the addressee’s mind. For example, I hope you feel
better soon is generated as a response to I have had
a high fever for 3 days when the goal emotion is
specified as JOY, while Sorry, but you can’t join us
today is generated for SADNESS (Figure 1).

Systems that can perform the two tasks not only
serve as crucial components of dialogue systems
but also have interesting applications of their own.
Predicting the emotion of an addressee is use-
ful for filtering flames or infelicitous expressions
from online messages (Spertus, 1997). The re-
sponse generator that is aware of the emotion of
an addressee is also useful for text completion in
online conversation (Hasselgren et al., 2003; Pang
and Ravi, 2012).

This paper explores a data-driven approach to
performing the two tasks. With the recent emer-
gence of social media, especially microblogs, the
amount of dialogue data available is rapidly in-
creasing. Therefore, we are taking this opportu-
nity to building large-scale training data from mi-
croblog posts automatically. This approach allows
us to perform the two tasks in a large-scale with
little human effort.

We employ standard classifiers for predicting
the emotion of an addressee. Our contribution here
is to investigate the effectiveness of new features
that cannot be used in ordinary emotion recog-
nition, the task of estimating the emotion of a
speaker (or writer) from her/his utterance (or writ-
ing) (Ayadi et al., 2011; Bandyopadhyay and Oku-
mura, 2011; Balahur et al., 2011; Balahur et al.,
2012). We specifically extract features from the
addressee’s last utterance (e.g., I have had a high
fever for 3 days in Figure 1) and explore the effec-
tiveness of using such features. Such information
is characteristic of a dialogue situation.

To perform the generation task, we build a sta-
tistical response generator by following (Ritter et
al., 2011). To improve on the previous study, we
investigate a method for controlling the contents
of the response for, in our case, eliciting the goal
emotion. We achieve this by using a technique in-
spired by domain adaptation. We learn multiple
models, each of which is adapted for eliciting one

specific emotion. Also, we perform model inter-
polation for addressing data sparseness.

In our experiment, we automatically build train-
ing data consisting of over 640 million dialogues
from Japanese Twitter posts. Using this data set,
we train the classifiers that predict the emotion
of an addressee, and the response generators that
elicit the goal emotion. We evaluate our methods
on the test data that are built by five human work-
ers, and confirm the feasibility of the proposed ap-
proaches.

2 Emotion-tagged Dialogue Corpus

The key in making a supervised approach to pre-
dicting and eliciting addressee’s emotion success-
ful is to obtain large-scale, reliable training data
effectually. We thus automatically build a large-
scale emotion-tagged dialogue corpus from mi-
croblog posts, and use it as the training data in the
prediction and generation tasks.

This section describes a method for construct-
ing the emotion-tagged dialogue corpus. We first
describe how to extract dialogues from posts in
Twitter, a popular microblogging service. We then
explain how to automatically annotate utterances
in the extracted dialogues with the addressers’
emotions by using emotional expressions as clues.

2.1 Mining dialogues from Twitter

We have first crawled utterances (posts) from
Twitter by using the Twitter REST API.3 The
crawled data consist of 5.5 billion utterances in
Japanese tweeted by 770 thousand users from
March 2011 to December 2012. We next cleaned
up the crawled utterances by handling Twitter-
specific expressions; we replaced all URL strings
to ‘URL’, excluded utterances with the symbols
that indicate the re-posting (RT) or quoting (QT)
of others’ tweets, and erased @user name ap-
pearing at the head and tail of the utterances, since
they are usually added to make a reply. We ex-
cluded utterances given by any user whose name
included ‘bot.’

We then extracted dialogues from the resulting
utterances, assuming that a series of utterances
interchangeably made by two users form a dia-
logue. We here exploited ‘in reply to status id’
field of each utterance provided by Twitter REST
API to link to the other, if any, utterance to which
it replied.

Table 1 lists the statistics of the extracted di-
alogues, while Figure 2 plots the number of di-
alogues plotted against the dialogue length (the
number of utterances in dialogue). Most dialogues
(98.2%) consist of at most 10 utterances, although
the longest dialogue includes 1745 utterances and
spans more than six weeks.

2.2 Tagging utterances with addressers’
emotions

We then automatically labeled utterances in the
obtained dialogues with the addressers’ emotions
by using emotional expressions as clues (Table 2).
In this study, we have adopted Plutchik (1980)’s
eight emotional categories (ANGER, ANTICIPA-
TION, DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, SUR-
PRISE, and TRUST) as the targets to label, and
manually tailored around ten emotional expres-
sions for each emotional category. Table 3 lists
examples of the emotional expressions, while the

rest are mostly their spelling variations.4

Because precise annotation is critical in the su-
pervised learning scenario, we annotate utterances
with the addressers’ emotions only when the emo-
tional expressions do not:

1. modify content words.

2. accompany an expression of negation, condi-
tional, imperative, interrogative, concession,
or indirect speech in the same sentence.

For example, I saw a frustrated teacher is re-
jected by the first condition, while I’ll be happy
if it rains is rejected by the second condition. The
second condition was judged by checking whether
the sentence includes trigger expressions such as
‘ない (not/never)’, ‘たら (if-clause)’, ‘?’, ‘けど
((al)though)’, and ‘と (that-clause)’.

Table 4 lists the size and precision of the utter-
ances labeled with the addressers’ emotions. Two
human workers measured the precision of the an-
notation by examining 100 labeled utterances ran-
domly sampled for each emotional category. The
inter-rater agreement was κ = 0.85, indicating al-
most perfect agreement. The precision of the an-
notation exceeded 0.95 for most of the emotional
categories.

4Note that the clue emotional expressions are language-
specific but can be easily tailored for other languages. Here,
Japanese emotional expressions are translated into English to
widen the potential readership of the paper.

3 Predicting Addressee’s Emotion

This section describes a method for predicting
emotion elicited in an addressee when s/he re-
ceives a response to her/his utterance. The input
to this task is a pair of an utterance and a response
to it, e.g., the two utterances in Figure 1, while
the output is the addressee’s emotion among the
emotional categories of Plutchik (1980) (JOY and
SADNESS for the top and bottom dialogues in Fig-
ure 1, respectively).

Although a response could elicit multiple emo-
tions in the addressee, in this paper we focus on
predicting the most salient emotion elicited in the
addressee and cast the prediction as a single-label
multi-class classification problem.5 We then con-
struct a one-versus-the-rest classifier6 by combin-
ing eight binary classifiers, each of which predicts
whether the response elicits each emotional cate-
gory. We use online passive-aggressive algorithm
to train the eight binary classifiers.

We exploit the emotion-tagged dialogue corpus
constructed in Section 2 to collect training exam-
ples for the prediction task. For each emotion-
tagged utterance in the corpus, we assume that the
tagged emotion is elicited by the (last) response.
We thereby extract the pair of utterances preced-
ing the emotion-tagged utterance and the tagged
emotion as one training example. Taking the di-
alogue in Table 2 as an example, we obtain one
training example from the first two utterances and
SURPRISE as the emotion elicited in user A.

We extract all the n-grams (n ≤ 3) in the re-
sponse to induce (binary) n-gram features. The
extracted n-grams could indicate a certain action
that elicits a specific emotion (e.g., ‘have a fever’
in Table 2), or a style or tone of speaking (e.g.,
‘Sorry’). Likewise, we extract word n-grams from
the addressee’s utterance. The extracted n-grams
activate another set of binary n-gram features.

Because word n-grams themselves are likely to
be sparse, we estimate the addressers’ emotions
from their utterances and exploit them to induce
emotion features. The addresser’s emotion has
been reported to influence the addressee’s emotion

5Because microblog posts are short, we expect emotions
elicited by a response post not to be very diverse and a multi-
class classification to be able to capture the essential crux of
the prediction task.

6We should note that a one-versus-the-rest classifier can
be used in the multi-label classification scenario, just by al-
lowing the classifier to output more than one emotional cate-
gory (Ghamrawi and McCallum, 2005).

strongly (Kim et al., 2012), while the addressee’s
emotion just before receiving a response can be a
reference to predict her/his emotion in question af-
ter receiving the response.

To induce emotion features, we exploit the rule-
based approach used in Section 2.2 to estimate
the addresser’s emotion. Since the rule-based ap-
proach annotates utterances with emotions only
when they contain emotional expressions, we in-
dependently train for each emotional category
a binary classifier that estimates the addresser’s
emotion from her/his utterance and apply it to the
unlabeled utterances. The training data for these
classifiers are the emotion-tagged utterances ob-
tained in Section 2, while the features are n-grams
(n ≤ 3)7 in the utterance.

We should emphasize that the features induced
from the addressee’s utterance are unique to this
task and are hardly available in the related tasks
that predicted the emotion of a reader of news ar-
ticles (Lin and Hsin-Yihn, 2008) or personal sto-
ries (Socher et al., 2011). We will later confirm the
impact of these features on the prediction accuracy
in the experiments.

4 Eliciting Addressee’s Emotion

This section presents a method for generating a re-
sponse that elicits the goal emotion, which is one
of the emotional categories of Plutchik (1980), in
the addressee. In section 4.1, we describe a statis-
tical framework for response generation proposed
by (Ritter et al., 2011). In section 4.2, we present
how to adapt the model in order to generate a
response that elicits the goal emotion in the ad-
dressee.

4.1 Statistical response generation

Following (Ritter et al., 2011), we apply the sta-
tistical machine translation model for generating a
response to a given utterance. In this framework,
a response is viewed as a translation of the input
utterance. Similar to ordinary machine translation
systems, the model is learned from pairs of an ut-
terance and a response by using off-the-shelf tools
for machine translation.

We use GIZA++8 and SRILM9 for learning
translation model and 5-gram language model, re-

7We have excluded n-grams that matched the emotional
expressions used in Section 2 to avoid overfitting.

srilm/

spectively. As post-processing, some phrase pairs
are filtered out from the translation table as fol-
lows. When GIZA++ is directly applied to di-
alogue data, it frequently finds paraphrase pairs,
learning to parrot back the input (Ritter et al.,
2011). To avoid using such pairs for response gen-
eration, a phrase pair is removed if one phrase is
the substring of the other.

We use Moses decoder10 to search for the best
response to a given utterance. Unlike machine
translation, we do not use reordering models, be-
cause the positions of phrases are not considered
to correlate strongly with the appropriateness of
responses (Ritter et al., 2011). In addition, we do
not use any discriminative training methods such
as MERT for optimizing the feature weights (Och,
2003). They are set as default values provided by
Moses (Ritter et al., 2011).

4.2 Model adaptation

The above framework allows us to generate appro-
priate responses to arbitrary input utterances. On
top of this framework, we have developed a re-
sponse generator that elicits a specific emotion.

We use the emotion-tagged dialogue corpus to
learn eight translation models and language mod-
els, each of which is specialized in generating
the response that elicits one of the eight emo-
tions (Plutchik, 1980). Specifically, the models
are learned from utterances preceding ones that are
tagged with emotional category. As an example,
let us examine to learn models for eliciting SUR-
PRISE from the dialogue in Table 2. In this case,
the first two utterances are used to learn the trans-
lation model, while only the second utterance is
used to learn the language model.

However, this simple approach is prone to suf-
fer from the data sparseness problem. Because
not all the utterances are tagged with the emotion
in emotion-tagged dialogue corpus, only a small
fraction of utterances can be used for learning the
adapted models.

We perform model interpolation for addressing
this problem. In addition to the adapted mod-
els described above, we also use a general model,
which is learned from the entire corpus. The two
models are then merged as the weighted linear in-
terpolation.

Specifically, we use tmcombine.py script
provided by Moses for the interpolation of trans-

10http://www.statmt.org/moses/

lation models (Sennrich, 2012). For all the four
features (i.e., two phrase translation probabilities
and two lexical weights) derived from transla-
tion model, the weights of the adapted model are
equally set as α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1.0). On the other
hand, we use SRILM for the interpolation of lan-
guage models. The weight of the adapted model is
set as β (0 ≤ β ≤ 1.0).

The parameters α and β control the strength of
the adapted models. Only adapted models are used
when α (or β) = 1.0, while the adapted models are
not at all used when α (or β) = 0. When both α
and β are specified as 0, the model becomes equiv-
alent to the original one described in section 4.1.

5 Experiments

5.1 Test data

To evaluate the proposed method, we built, as test
data, sets of an utterance paired with responses
that elicit a certain goal emotion (Table 5). Note
that they were used for evaluation in both of the
two tasks. Each utterance in the test data has
more than one responses that elicit the same goal
emotion, because they are used to compute BLEU
score (see section 5.3).

The data set was built in the following manner.
We first asked five human worker to produce re-
sponses to 80 utterances (10 utterances for each
goal emotion). Note that the 80 utterances do not
have overlap between workers and that the worker
produced only one response to each utterance.

To alleviate the burden on the workers, we ac-
tually provided each worker with the utterances
in the emotion-tagged corpus. Then we asked
each worker to select 80 utterances to which s/he
thought s/he could easily respond. The selected
utterances were removed from the corpus during
training.

As a result, we obtained 400 utterance-response
pairs (= 80 utterance-response pairs × 5 work-
ers). For each of those 400 utterances, two ad-
ditional responses are produced. We did not al-
low the same worker to produce more than one
response to the same utterance. In this way, we
obtained 1200 responses for the 400 utterances in
total.

Finally, we assessed the data quality to remove
responses that were unlikely to elicit the goal emo-
tion. For each utterance-response pair, we asked
two workers to judge whether the response elicited
the goal emotion. If both workers regarded the

We first report experimental results on predicting
the addressee’s emotion within a dialogue. Table 6

to train eight binary classifiers for individual emo-
tional categories, which form a one-versus-the rest
classifier for the prediction task. We used opal11

as an implementation of online passive-aggressive
algorithm to train the individual classifiers.

To investigate the impact of the features that are
uniquely available in a dialogue data, we com-
pared classifiers trained with the following two
sets of features in terms of precision, recall, and
F1 for each emotional category.

RESPONSE/UTTER. The n-gram and emotion
features induced from the response and the
addressee’s utterance.

Table 7 lists prediction results. We can see that
the features induced from the addressee’s utter-
ance significantly improved the prediction perfor-
mance, F1, for emotions other than FEAR. FEAR is
elicited instantly by the response, and the features
induced from the addressee’s utterance thereby
confused the classifier.

Table 8 shows a confusion matrix of the classi-
fier using all the features, with mostly predicted
emotions bold-faced and mostly confused emo-
tions underlined for each emotional category. We
can find some typical confusing pairs of emotions
from this matrix. The classifier confuses DISGUST
with ANGER and vice versa, while it confuses JOY
with ANTICIPATION. These confusions conform
to our expectation, since they are actually similar
emotions. The classifier was less likely to confuse
positive emotions (JOY and ANTICIPATION) with
negative emotion (ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, and
SADNESS) vice versa.

Table 9: Examples of utterance-response pairs to
which the system predicted wrong emotions.

We have briefly examined the confusions and
found the two major types of errors, each of which
is exemplified in Table 9. The first (top) one is sar-
casm or irony, which has been reported to be diffi-
cult to capture by lexical features alone (González-
Ibáñez et al., 2011). The other (bottom) one is due
to lack of information. In this example, only if the
addressee does not know the fact provided by the
response, s/he will surprise at it.

5.3 Generation task

We next demonstrate the experimental results for
eliciting the emotion of the addressee.

We use the utterance pairs summarized in Ta-
ble 6 to learn the translation models and language
models for eliciting each emotional category. We
also use the 640 million utterances pairs in the
entire emotion-tagged corpus for learning general
models. However, for learning the general transla-
tion models, we currently use 4 millions of utter-
ance pairs sampled from the 640 millions of pairs
due to the computational limitation.

Automatic evaluation
We first use BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002)
to perform automatic evaluation (Ritter et al.,
2011). In this evaluation, the system is pro-
vided with the utterance and the goal emotion
in the test data and the generated responses are
evaluated through BLEU score. Specifically, we
conducted two-fold cross-validation to optimize
the weights of our method. We tried α and
β in {0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} and selected the
weights that achieved the best BLEU score. Note
that we adopted different values of the weights for
different emotional categories.

Table 10 compares BLEU scores of three meth-
ods including the proposed one. The first row
represents a method that does not perform model
adaptation at all. It corresponds to the special case

System BLEU
NO ADAPTATION 0.64
PROPOSED 1.05
OPTIMAL 1.57

Table 10: Comparison of BLEU scores.

(i.e., α = β = 0.0) of the proposed method. The
second row represents our method, while the last
row represents the result of our method when the
weights are set as optimal, i.e., those achieving the
best BLEU on the test data. This result can be con-
sidered as an upper bound on BLEU score.

The results demonstrate that model adaptation
is useful for generating the responses that elicit
the goal emotion. We can clearly observe the im-
provement in the BLEU from 0.64 to 1.05.

On the other hand, there still remains a gap be-
tween the last two rows (i.e., proposed and opti-
mal). We think this is partly because the current
test data is too small to reliably tune parameters.

Human evaluation
We next asked two human workers to manually
evaluate the generation results.

In this evaluation, the baseline (no adaptation
in Table 10) and proposed method generated a re-
sponse for each of the 396 utterances in the test
data. For the resulting 792 utterance-response
pairs, the two workers manually assessed the ap-
propriateness of the response. Each response was
judged whether it is grammatical and meaningful.
If the response was regarded as so by either of the
workers, it was further judged whether it elicits the
goal emotion or not. To make the comparison fair,
we did not expose to the workers which system
generated the response. In addition, the responses
generated by the two systems were presented in a
random order.

As the result, 147 and 157 responses of the
baseline and proposed method were regarded as
appropriate, i.e., ecliting the goal emotion, by ei-
ther of the workers; 74 and 92 responses were
regarded as appropirate by both of the workers.
These results suggest the effectiveness of the pro-
posed method. Especially, we can confirm that
the proposed method can generate responses that
elicit addresee’s emotion more clearly. We inves-
tigated the agreement between the two workers in
this evaluation. We found that the κ coefficient is
0.59, which indicates moderate agreement. This
supports the reliability of our evaluation.

Goal emotion: JOY
Input: 写真コンクールで優秀賞とったーーーー！2月 7日表彰式！

(I wooooon the outstanding award at the photo competition! The ceremony is on Feb. 7!)
NO ADAPTATION: 残念ながら１日目だけですのー (Sorry to say, only the first day.)
PROPOSED: 金賞受賞おめでとう！！！おめでとうなのー

(Congratulations on winning the gold prize!!! Congrats.)
Goal emotion: TRUST
Input: 自暴自棄になっているの？ (Do you get desperate? )
NO ADAPTATION: 楽しみ！ (I’m looking forward to it!)
PROPOSED: きっとまだ大丈夫 (Maybe still OK.)
Goal emotion: ANTICIPATION
Input: だよね！なんとかなるよね！ww

(Huh! It’s gonna be all right! lol)
あ，わたしグッズ買わなきゃなのでその時間だけは取ってくれるとうれしい (´∀｀)
(I gotta buy the goods, so I’ll be glad if you can take the time :-))

NO ADAPTATION: 私はグッズ買ってないから不安ですね (Since I’ve not bought it, I feel worried.)
PROPOSED: いいですね！私も買いますね！！！ (Good! I’ll buy it too!!!)

Table 11: Examples of the responses generated by the two systems, NO ADAPTATION and PROPOSED.

Examples
Table 11 illustrates examples of the responses gen-
erated by the no adaptation baseline and proposed
method. In the first two examples, the proposed
method successfully generates responses that elicit
the goal emotions: JOY and TRUST. From these
examples, we can consider that the adapted model
assigns large probability to phrases such as con-
gratulations or OK. In the last example, the sys-
tem also succeeded in eliciting the goal emotion:
ANTICIPATION. For this example, we can interpret
that the speaker of the response (i.e., the system)
feels anticipation, and consequently the emotion
of the addressee is affected by the emotion of the
speaker (i.e., the system). Interestingly, a similar
phenomenon is also observed in real conversation
(Kim et al., 2012).

6 Related Work

There have been a tremendous amount of stud-
ies on predicting the emotion from text or speech
data (Ayadi et al., 2011; Bandyopadhyay and Oku-
mura, 2011; Balahur et al., 2011; Balahur et al.,
2012). Unlike our prediction task, most of them
have exclusively focused on estimating the emo-
tion of a speaker (or writer) from her/his utterance
(or writing).

Analogous to our prediction task, Lin and Hsin-
Yihn (2008) and Socher et al. (2011) investigated
predicting the emotion of a reader from the text
that s/he reads. Our work differs from them in that
we focus on dialogue data, and we exploit fea-
tures that are not available within their task set-
tings, e.g., the addressee’s previous utterance.

Tokuhisa et al. (2008) proposed a method for

extracting pairs of an event (e.g., It rained sud-
denly when I went to see the cherry blossoms) and
an emotion elicited by it (e.g., SADNESS) from the
Web text. The extracted data are used for emotion
classification. A similar technique would be use-
ful for prediction the emotion of an addressee as
well.

Response generation has a long research history
(Weizenbaum, 1966), although it is only very re-
cently that a fully statistical approach was intro-
duced in this field (Ritter et al., 2011). At this mo-
ment, we are unaware of any statistical response
generators that model the emotion of the user.

Some researchers have explored generating
jokes or humorous text (Dybala et al., 2010;
Labtov and Lipson, 2012). Those attempts are
similar to our work in that they also aim at elic-
iting a certain emotion in the addressee. They are,
however, restricted to elicit a specific emotion.

The linear interpolation of translation and/or
language models is a widely-used technique for
adapting machine translation systems to new do-
mains (Sennrich, 2012). However, it has not been
touched in the context of response generation.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have explored predicting and
eliciting the emotion of an addressee by using a
large amount of dialogue data obtained from mi-
croblog posts. In the first attempt to model the
emotion of an addressee in the field of NLP, we
demonstrated that the response of the dialogue
partner and the previous utterance of the addressee
are useful for predicting the emotion. In the gen-
eration task, on the other hand, we showed that the

model adaptation approach successfully generates
the responses that elicit the goal emotion.

For future work, we want to use longer dialogue
history in both tasks. While we considered only
two utterances as a history, a longer history would
be helpful. We also plan to personalize the pro-
posed methods, exploiting microblog posts made
by users of a certain age, gender, occupation, or
even character to perform model adaptation.
