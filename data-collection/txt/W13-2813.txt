Abstract 

Since the Tunisian revolution, Tunisian Dialect (TD) 

used in daily life, has became progressively used and 

represented in interviews, news and debate programs 

instead of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This situ-

ation has important negative consequences for natural 

language processing (NLP): since the spoken dialects 

are not officially written and do not have standard 

orthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate cor-

pora to use for training NLP tools. Furthermore, there 

are almost no parallel corpora involving TD and 

MSA. In this paper, we describe the creation of Tuni-

sian dialect text corpus as well as a method for build-

ing a bilingual dictionary, in order to create language 

model for speech recognition system for the Tunisian 

Broadcast News. So, we use explicit knowledge about 

the relation between TD and MSA.  

1 Introduction 

Recently, due to the political changes that 

have occurred in the Arab world, we noticed a 

new remarkable diversity in the media. Arabic 

dialects used in daily life have became progres-

sively used and represented in interviews, news 

and debate programs instead of Modern Standard 

Arabic (MSA). In Tunisia for example, the revo-

lution has affected not only the people but also 

the media. Since that, the media programs have 

been changed:  television channels, political de-

bates and broadcasts news have been multiplied. 

Therefore, this gave birth to a new kind of lan-

guage. Indeed, the majority of speech is no long-

er on MSA but alternating between MSA and 

dialect. Thus, we can distinguish in the same 

speech, MSA words, TD words and MSA-TD 

words such as a word with an MSA component 

(stem) and dialectal affixes.  This situation poses 

significant challenges to NLP, in fact applying 

NLP tools designed for MSA directly to TD 

yields significantly lower performance, making it 

imperative to direct the research to building re-

sources and tools to process this kind of lan-

guage. In our case we aim to convert this new 

language to text, but this process presents a se-

ries of linguistic and computational challenges 

some of these relate to language modeling: stud-

ying large amounts of text to learn about patterns 

of words in a language. This task is complicated 

because of the total lack of TD-MSA resources, 

whether parallel text or paper dictionaries. In this 

paper, we describe a method to create Tunisian 

Dialect (TD) text corpora and the associated lex-

ical resources as well as building bilingual dic-

tionary MSA-TD.  

2 Related work  

Spoken languages which have no written form 

can be classified as limited-resources languages. 

Therefore, several studies has attempted to over-

come the problems of computerization of these 

languages. (Scherrer, 2008) in order to computer-

ize the existing dialect in Switzerland, developed 

a translation system: standard German to any 

variety of the dialect continuum of German-

speaking Switzerland. Moreover, (Shaalan et al, 

2007) proposed a system of translation MSA-

Egyptian dialect. For this, they tried to build a 

parallel corpus between Egyptian dialect and 

MSA-based on mapping rules EGY-MSA. Be-

sides dialects, there are several languages from 

the group of limited-resources languages that do 

not have a relation with a well-resourced lan-

guage. Indeed, (Nimaan et al., 2006) presented 

several scenarios to collect corpora in order to 

88



process the Somali language: Collecting corpus 

from the web, automatic synthesis of texts and 

machine translation French-Somali. (SENG, 

2010) selected news sites in Khmer to collect 

data in order to solicit the lack of resources in 

Khmer. 

The literature shows that there is little work that 

dealt with the Tunisian Arabic, the target lan-

guage of this work. (Graja et al, 2011), for ex-

ample, treated the Tunisian Dialect for under-

standing speech. To train their system, research-

ers relied on manual transcripts of conversations 

between agents at the train station and travelers. 

However, a limited vocabulary is a problem if 

we want to model a language model for a system 

of recognition of television's programs with a 

wide and varied vocabulary. 

3 Method to create Tunisian Dialect 
Corpora  

In Arabic there are almost no parallel corpora 

involving TD and MSA. Therefore, Machine 

Translation (MT) is not easy, especially when 

there are no MT resources available such as natu-

rally occurring parallel text or transfer lexicon. 

So, to deal with this problem, we proposed to 

leverage the large available annotated MSA re-

sources by exploiting MSA/dialect similarities 

and addressing known differences. Our approach 

consists first on studying the morphological, syn-

tactic and lexical difference by exploiting the 

Penn Arabic Treebank. Second, presenting these 

differences by developing rules and building dia-

lectal concepts. Finally, storing these transfor-

mations into dictionaries.   

3.1 Penn Arabic TreeBank corpora to cre-
ate bilingual lexicon MSA-TD 

Treebanks, are an important resources that al-

lows for important research in general NLP ap-

plications. In the case of Arabic, two important 

treebanking efforts exist: the Penn Arabic Tree-

bank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004; Maamouri 

et al., 2009) and the Prague Arabic Dependency 

Treebank (PADT) (Smrž and Haji, 2007; Smrž et 

al., 2008).  The PATB not only provides tokeni-

zation, complex POS tags, and syntactic struc-

ture; it also provides empty categories, 

diacritizations, lemma choices. The PATB con-

sists of 23,611 parse-annotated sentences (Bies 

and Maamouri, 2003; Maamouri and Bies, 2004) 

from Arabic newswire text in MSA. The PATB 

annotation scheme involves 497 different POS-

tags with morphological information. In this 

work we attempted to mitigate the genre 

differences by transforming the MSA-ATB to 

look like TD-ATB. This will allow us to create in 

tandem a bilingual lexicon with different 

dialectal concept (Figure1). For this, we adopted 

a transformation method based on the parts of 

speech of ATB's word.

resources 

3.2 Modeling verbal lexical entries for the 
bilingual dictionary 

As we aim to adapt MSA tools to TD, we tried to 

build for TD verbs the same concepts as those in 

MSA. Therefore, we focused in this work on the 

study of correspondence that may exist among 

the concepts of MSA verbs and dialect verbs. In 

Arabic there are three principal verbal concepts: 

1-Root: It is the basic source of all forms of Ara-

bic verb. The root is not a real word rather it is a 

sequence of three consonants that can be found 

in all words that are related to it. Most roots are 

composed of three letters, very few are of four or 

five consonants. 

2-Pattern: In MSA, patterns are models with dif-

ferent structures that are applied to the root to 

create a lemma. For example, for the root ج ر خ : 

xrj, we can apply different patterns, which give 

different lemmas with different meanings  

Root1: xrj/ رج خ / C1C2C3+ verbal pattern1: 

AistaC1oC2a3 =lemma1  َاْسَتْخَرج/ to extract  

Root1: xrj/خرج/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern2 

FoEaL(FaEal)=lemma2   ََخَرج / to go out . 

Root1: xrj ( رج خ )/C1C2C3+ verbal pattern3 

>aC1oC2aC3=lemma3  ََأْخَرج / to eject 

 2-Lemma: The lemma is a fundamental concept 

in the processing of texts in at least some lan-

guages. Arabic words can be analyzed as consist-

ing of a root inserted into a pattern.   

TD-lemma building: Verbs in the PATB corpus 

are presented in their inflected forms. So, we ex-

tracted lemmas and their roots using the morpho-

logical analyzer developed by Elexir FM (Smrz, 

2007). As we are native speakers of TD, we as-

sociate to each MSA-Lemma a TUN-Lemma. As 

a result, we found that 60% of verbs change to-

tally by passing from MSA to TD. As we have 

1500 TD-Lemmas, and starting from the fact that 

89



MSA verbs have patterns describing their mor-

phological behavior during conjugation, we tried 

to assign, if possible, to each TD-Lemma a TD-

Pattern. 

TD-pattern building: The challenge on building 

TD-pattern was to find patterns similar to those 

in MSA. Thus, by studying the morphology of  

TD-lemmas, we remarked  that it's possible to 

assign to TD-lemmas the same pattern as those 

on MSA but with defining other patterns that will 

be sub-patterns to these patterns. In fact, this 

process has allowed distinguishing 32 patterns 

for dialect verbs while there were 15 in MSA. 

This was due to the morphological richness and 

the frequent change of vowel within TD-lemmas. 

For example: 

In MSA $Arak/yu$Arik/to participate and 

dAfaE/yudAFiE/to defend belongs to the 

patternII: CACaC(perfectiveform)/yiCACiC 

(imperfectiveform). In TD the model of these 

tow verbs remains CACVC/yVCACVC but the 

vowel of the second consonant of the pattern 

(vowel letter ع / E) change. The mark of this 

vowel is a fundamental criterion for classifying a 

verb in MSA (Ouerhani, 2009), that's why we 

proposed to define tow sub-pattern for the pat-

tern II,  by dividing the pattern-II to II-i: 

CACiC/yVCACiC and II-a:CACaC/yVCACaC. 

As consequence, $Arak/yu$Arik/ becomes in TD 

$Arik/yi$Arik/ belongs to CACiC/yVCACiC and 

dAfaE/yudAFiE becomes in TD dAfaE/yidAFaE  

belongs to CACaC/yiVCACaC. 

 Therefore, by adopting this reasoning, we suc-

ceeded with the ATB's verbs to define pattern for 

the TD verb. Thus, knowing these new patterns, 

we will be able to assign a pattern for all TD 

verbs.  

TD-root building: In Tunisian dialect, there is 

no standard definition for the root. For this, con-

struction of root dialect was not obvious, espe-

cially when the root verb changes completely 

through the MSA to the dialect. In fact, to define 

a root for TD verbs, we have adopted a deductive 

method. Indeed, in MSA, the rule says: root + 

pattern= Lemma (1). In our case, we have al-

ready defined the TD-lemma and the TD-pattern. 

Following rule (1), the extraction of the root is 

then made easy. For example, we classified the 

lemma إستنى /Aistan ~ aY/Wait in the pattern 

AistaCCaC then root(?) + AistaCCaC= إستنى / ~ 

YAistana~ 

Following (1), the root for the verb  إستنى   /Aistan 

~ aY/Wait is "نني" [NNY]. In fact, we can say that 

the definition of roots is a problematic issue 

which could allow more discussion. According 

to (1), it was like we have forced the roots to be 

[NNY]. However, if we classified Aistann ~ aY 

under the pattern AiCCaCal, the root in this case 

must be snn. The root can also be quadrilateral 

 snnY if we classified Aistann~ aY under the / سنني

pattern AiCCaCaC. But as there's no standard, 

we have done in our best to be the most logical 

possible to define dialectal root. 

3.3 Structure of verbal lexicon entries 

Different verbal transformations described above 

are modeled and stored at a dictionary of verb as 

follows: to each MSA verbal block containing 

MSA-lemma, MSA-pattern and MSA-root will 

correspond TD- block which containing TD-

lemma, TD-root and TD-pattern. So, knowing 

the pattern and the root we will able to generate 

automatically various inflected forms of the TUN 

verbs. That’s why we stored in our dictionary the 

active and the passive form of the TD-lemma in 

perfective and imperfective tense. We also store 

the inflected forms in the imperative (CV).  Fig-

ure 2 shows the structure that we have defined 

for the dictionary to present the TD-verbal con-

cepts (in section 4 we will explain how we will 

automate the enrichment of this dictionary).

3.4 Modeling lexical entries for tools words 
in the bilingual dictionary 

Tools words or syntactic tools are an area that 

reflects the specific syntax of the dialect. It has a 

90



large amount in the Treebank and all MSA-texts. 

However, their transformation was not trivial and 

required, for each tool a study of its different 

context. In our approach, we defined two kinds 

of transformations. The first requires the study of 

different context of a tool word. In fact, the same 

word may have different translations depending 

on its context. Thus, to deal with the variation of 

context, we developed mapping rules. Note that 

among these contexts, there are those that cause 

a change in the syntactic order of words by pass-

ing to the dialect. The second transformation is 

direct, the word remains unchanged whatever the 

context. 

3.5 Context dependent transformation 

We mean by transformation-based context, the 

passage MSA-DT which is based on transfor-

mation rules. Indeed given a word W, we say 

that the transformation of W is based on context 

if it gives a new translation whenever it changes 

on context. RT :  X + W + Y = TDk 

X =
m

j=

POSjWj

: ; Y = 
n

=i

POSiWi
1

: ; k var-

ies from 1 to z ;                                

RTk: transformation rules n°k ; POS : Part of 

speech ; W :word tool, TDk: Translation n°k 

The transformation of a tool word may depend to 

the words that it precedes (X), or the following 

word (Y), or both. If none of the contexts is pre-

sented, then a default translation will be assigned 

to the word tool. For example, For the tool word  

-hatY]/So that  which have the POS: Prep] "حتى"

osition, we developed three different  mapping 

rules depending to the context in the ATB corpo-

ra. 

 + (TUN-particle) باش = HatY + verb / َحتَّى -1
TUN_verb 

-TUN) باش = HatY + NEG_PART /َحتَّى    -2
particle)+ TUN_NEG_PART 

                   otherwise 

 HatY/ َحتَّى = HatY/َحتَّى -3
In total, we developed 316 rules for the ATB's 

tools words. Figure 3 shows how we present a 

transformation rule in the dictionary. For each 

tool word we have defined a set of contexts, each 

context contains one or more configurations. The 

configuration describes the position and the part 

of speech of the words of context. Each context 

corresponds to a new translation of the tool 

word.

Figure3- Context dependent rule structure in 

dictionary 

 

Syntactic transformation:  
The order of the elements in the dialect sentence 

seems to be relatively less important than in oth-

er languages . However, the canonical word or-

der in Tunisian verbal sentences is SVO (Sub-

ject-Verb-Object) (Baccouche , 2004). In con-

trast, MSA word order can have the following 

three forms: SVO / VSO / VOS (2). 

(1) TD:  ْْكتِبْ  الْطُفل الَدْرس  /AlTfol ktib aldars/the child 

wrote the lesson: SVO 

(2) MSA: الطفل كتب الدرس /ktib Altfol Ald~ars/wrote 

the boy the lesson: VSO. 

This opposition bestween the MSA and the dia-

lect is clearer in the case of proper names. In 

fact, MSA order is VSO (3) while the order in 

TD is SVO. (Mahfoudhi, 2002) 

(3) MSA: أكل القط الفئران />akal Alqit Alfi>rAn / 

Cats rats 

(4) TD:  القط أكل الفئران / Alqit >akal Alfi>rAn /Cats 

eat rats 

There are other types of simple dialect sentences 

named nominal sentences which do not contain a 

verb. They have the same order in both Tunisian 

and MSA. For example: 

MSA: حار الطقس /TaKs HAr/ weather is hot 

TD:  ْْسُخونْ  الَطْقس / TaKs sxuwn/ weather is hot 

In our work, we discussed the syntactic level at 

some nominal groups. The word order is general-

ly reversed by passing to TD. For example: 
(1)MSA: ADV + ADJ: 

 muvaK~af/also educated/ ْمثَقَّف +ayDaA/Also</ أيضا

 (2) TD: ADJ +ADV: 

 TD: ADJ/ ْمَثقَّف +ADV/ زاده 
(2)MSA: Noun + ADJ: 

 kutubun kavira/many books/ ُكتُب َكثِيرة 

91



TD: ADJ + Noun: 

كتُب برشا  /bar$A ktub 

In the dictionary, we present this kind of rule as 

shown in the figure 4.

3.6 Context independent transformation  

In addition to the context-dependent 

transformations, the translation of some tools 

words in the corpus was direct "word to word", 

eg; the word remains the same regardless of the 

context. Figure 5 shows an example of how we 

represented this kind of translation in the

4 Automatic generation of Tunisian Di-
alect corpora 

To test and improve the developed bilingual 

models, we tried by exploiting our dictionaries to 

automate the task of converting MSA corpora to 

a corpora with a dialect appearance.  

For this, we developed a tool called Tunisian 

Dialect Translator (TDT) which enables to pro-

duce TD texts and to enrich the MSA-TD dic-

tionary (Figure 6). This tool works according to 

the following steps: 

1-Morphosyntactic annotation of MSA texts: 

TDT annotate each MSA text 

morphosyntactically by using MADA analyzer 

(Morphological Analyser and disambiguisator of 

Arabic) (Habash, 2010). MADA is a toolkit that, 

given a raw MSA text, adds as much lexical and 

morphological information as possible by disam-

biguating in one operation part-of-speech tags, 

lexemes, diacritizations and full morphological 

analyses. 

2-Exploiting MSA-TD Dictionaries: Based on 

each part of speech of the MSA-word, TDT pro-

pose for each MSA structure the corresponding 

TD translation by exploiting the MSA-TD dic-

tionaries.  

3-Enriching lexicon:  As the lexical database 

does not cover all Arabic words, texts resulting 

from the previous step are not totally translated. 

Therefore, in order to improve the quality of 

translation and to enrich our dictionaries to be 

well used even in other NLP application, we 

added to TDT a semi-automatic enrichment 

module. This module filters first all MSA words 

for which a translation has not been provided. 

Then, TDT assigned for them their 

corresponding MSA-lemmas and POS, the user 

proposes, if the POS is verb or noun, a TD-root  

and a TD-pattern (described in subsection 3.2) 

and the TDT proposes automatically the 

appropriate Tunisian lemma and it's inflected 

forms. 

5 Evaluation  

To evaluate different translations of the verbs 

dictionary, we asked 47 judges (native speakers) 

to translate a sample containing 10% of verbs in 

the dictionary. The evaluation consists in com-

paring what we have proposed as a translation of 

lexical items taken from the ATB with the pro-

posals of judges who are native speakers of Tu-

nisian dialect. The percentages calculated reflect 

the percentage of agreement for each verb trans-

lations between judges and the translation pro-

posed in our lexicon. Table 1 shows the obtained 

results.  

       Table 1- Evaluation of verb translation  

For the same context, an MSA-Verb may have 

many translations. The agreement decreases for 

changed verbs because the judges may propose a 

valid translation different from what we have 

proposed in the dictionary. Moreover, as the 

translation of the majority of tool words depends 

on context, we asked 5 judges to translate 89 

sentences containing 133 words tools. In this 

sample, we made some tools words repeated in 

the same sentence but in different context. Table

(2) gives the percentages of agreement between 

the translations of the judges and those of our 

dictionaries of tools words. The variation in 

percentage is due to the fact that for some words, 

judges do not agree among themselves. The table 

also shows the percentage of disagreement 

between judges and dictionaries.

Table 2- Evaluation of   tool word translation 

 

In fact, the disagreement arises when no judge 

gives translation similar to the translation 

proposed in the dictionaries. But, by increasing 

the number of judges, the disagreement 

decreases which proves that our dictionaries are 

able to give acceptable translations by several 

judges 

6 Conclusion 

This paper presented an effort to create resources 

and translation tool for Tunisian dialect. 

To deal with the total lack of written resource in 

Tunisian dialect, we described first a methodolo-

gy that allowed the creation of bilingual diction-

aries with in tandem TD-ATB. In fact, TD-ATB 

will serve as a source of insight on the phenome-

na that need to be addressed and as corpora to 

train TD-NLP tools. We focused second on de-

scribing TDT a tool to generate automatically 

TD corpora and to enrich semi-automatically the 

dictionaries we have built. 

We plan to continue working on improving the 

TD-resources by studying the transformation of 

nouns. We also plan to validate our approach by 

measuring the ability of a language model, built 

on a corpus translated by our TDT tool, to model 

transcriptions of Tunisian broadcast news.  

Experiments in progress showed that the integra-

tion of translated data improves significantly lex-

ical coverage and perplexity of language models.
