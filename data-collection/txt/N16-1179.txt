Abstract

We show how eye-tracking corpora can be
used to improve sentence compression mod-
els, presenting a novel multi-task learning al-
gorithm based on multi-layer LSTMs. We ob-
tain performance competitive with or better
than state-of-the-art approaches.

1 Introduction

Sentence compression is a basic operation in text
simplification which has the potential to improve
statistical machine translation and automatic sum-
marization (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011; Klerke et
al., 2015), as well as helping poor readers in need of
assistive technologies (Canning et al., 2000). This
work suggests using eye-tracking recordings for im-
proving sentence compression for text simplification
systems and is motivated by two observations: (i)
Sentence compression is the task of automatically
making sentences easier to process by shortening
them. (ii) Eye-tracking measures such as first-pass
reading time and time spent on regressions, i.e., dur-
ing second and later passes over the text, are known
to correlate with perceived text difficulty (Rayner et
al., 2012).

These two observations recently lead Klerke et
al. (2015) to suggest using eye-tracking measures as
metrics in text simplification. We go beyond this by
suggesting that eye-tracking recordings can be used
to induce better models for sentence compression
for text simplification. Specifically, we show how
to use existing eye-tracking recordings to improve
the induction of Long Short-Term Memory models
(LSTMs) for sentence compression.

Our proposed model does not require that the gaze
data and the compression data come from the same
source. Indeed, in this work we use gaze data from
readers of the Dundee Corpus to improve sentence
compression results on several datasets. While not
explored here, an intriguing potential of this work
is in deriving sentence simplification models that
are personalized for individual users, based on their
reading behavior.

Several approaches to sentence compression have
been proposed, from noisy channel models (Knight
and Marcu, 2002) over conditional random fields
(Elming et al., 2013) to tree-to-tree machine trans-
lation models (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011). More
recently, Filippova et al. (2015) successfully used
LSTMs for sentence compression on a large scale
parallel dataset. We do not review the literature here,
and only compare to Filippova et al. (2015).

Our contributions

• We present a novel multi-task learning ap-
proach to sentence compression using labelled
data for sentence compression and a disjoint
eye-tracking corpus.

• Our method is fully competitive with state-of-
the-art across three corpora.

• Our code is made publicly available at

2 Gaze during reading

Readers fixate longer at rare words, words that are
semantically ambiguous, and words that are mor-

1528



phologically complex (Rayner et al., 2012). These
are also words that are likely to be replaced with
simpler ones in sentence simplification, but it is not
clear that they are words that would necessarily be
removed in the context of sentence compression.

Demberg and Keller (2008) show that syntac-
tic complexity (measured as dependency locality) is
also an important predictor of reading time. Phrases
that are often removed in sentence compression—
like fronted phrases, parentheticals, floating quanti-
fiers, etc.—are often associated with non-local de-
pendencies. Also, there is evidence that people are
more likely to fixate on the first word in a con-
stituent than on its second word (Hyönä and Pol-
latsek, 2000). Being able to identify constituent
borders is important for sentence compression, and
reading fixation data may help our model learn a rep-
resentation of our data that makes it easy to identify
constituent boundaries.

In the experiments below, we learn models to pre-
dict the first pass duration of word fixations and the
total duration of regressions to a word. These two
measures constitute a perfect separation of the to-
tal reading time of each word split between the first
pass and subsequent passes. Both measures are de-
scribed below. They are both discretized into six
bins as follows with only non-zero values contribut-
ing to the calculation of the standard deviation (SD):

0: measure = 0 or
1: measure < 1 SD below reader’s average or
2: measure < .5 SD below reader’s average or
3: measure < .5 above reader’s average or
4: measure > .5 SD above reader’s average or
5: measure > 1 SD above reader’s average

First pass duration measures the total time spent
reading a word first time it is fixated, including
any immediately following re-fixations of the same
word. This measure correlates with word length, fre-
quency and ambiguity because long words are likely
to attract several fixations in a row unless they are
particularly easily predicted or recognized. This ef-
fect arises because long words are less likely to fit
inside the fovea of the eye. Note that for this mea-
sure the value 0 indicates that the word was not fix-
ated by this reader.

Regression duration measures the total time
spent fixating a word after the gaze has already left
it once. This measure belongs to the group of late
measures, i.e., measures that are sensitive to the later
cognitive processing stages including interpretation
and integration of already decoded words. Since
the reader by definition has already had a chance to
recognize the word, regressions are associated with
semantic confusion and contradiction, incongruence
and syntactic complexity, as famously experienced
in garden path sentences. For this measure the value
0 indicates that the word was read at most once by
this reader.

See Table 1 for an example of first pass duration
and regression duration annotations for one reader
and sentence.

3 Sentence compression using multi-task
deep bi-LSTMs

Most recent approaches to sentence compression
make use of syntactic analysis, either by operating
directly on trees (Riezler et al., 2003; Nomoto, 2007;
Filippova and Strube, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2008;
Cohn and Lapata, 2009) or by incorporating syn-
tactic information in their model (McDonald, 2006;
Clarke and Lapata, 2008). Recently, however, Filip-
pova et al. (2015) presented an approach to sentence
compression using LSTMs with word embeddings,
but without syntactic features. We introduce a third
way of using syntactic annotation by jointly learning
a sequence model for predicting CCG supertags, in
addition to our gaze and compression models.

Bi-directional recurrent neural networks (bi-
RNNs) read in sequences in both regular and re-
versed order, enabling conditioning predictions on
both left and right context. In the forward pass, we
run the input data through an embedding layer and
compute the predictions of the forward and back-
ward states at layers 0, 1, . . ., until we compute the
softmax predictions for word i based on a linear
transformation of the concatenation of the of stan-
dard and reverse RNN outputs for location i. We
then calculate the objective function derivative for
the sequence using cross-entropy (logistic loss) and
use backpropagation to calculate gradients and up-
date the weights accordingly. A deep bi-RNN or k-
layered bi-RNN is composed of k bi-RNNs that feed
into each other such that the output of the ith RNN
is the input of the i + 1th RNN. LSTMs (Hochreiter
and Schmidhuber, 1997) replace the cells of RNNs
with LSTM cells, in which multiplicative gate units
learn to open and close access to the error signal.

Bi-LSTMs have already been used for fine-
grained sentiment analysis (Liu et al., 2015), syntac-
tic chunking (Huang et al., 2015), and semantic role
labeling (Zhou and Xu, 2015). These and other re-
cent applications of bi-LSTMs were constructed for
solving a single task in isolation, however. We in-
stead train deep bi-LSTMs to solve additional tasks
to sentence compression, namely CCG-tagging and
gaze prediction, using the additional tasks to regu-
larize our sentence compression model.

Specifically, we use bi-LSTMs with three lay-
ers. Our baseline model is simply this three-layered

model trained to predict compressions (encoded as
label sequences), and we consider two extensions
thereof as illustrated in Figure 2. Our first exten-
sion, MULTI-TASK-LSTM, includes the gaze pre-
diction task during training, with a separate logistic
regression classifier for this purpose; and the other,
CASCADED-LSTM, predicts gaze measures from
the inner layer. Our second extension, which is su-
perior to our first, is basically a one-layer bi-LSTM
for predicting reading fixations with a two-layer bi-
LSTM on top for predicting sentence compressions.

At each step in the training process of MULTI-
TASK-LSTMand CASCADED-LSTM, we choose a
random task, followed by a random training instance
of this task. We use the deep LSTM to predict a label
sequence, suffer a loss with respect to the true labels,
and update the model parameters. In CASCADED-
LSTM, the update for an instance of CCG super tag-
ging or gaze prediction only affects the parameters
of the inner LSTM layer.

Both MULTI-TASK-LSTM and CASCADED-
LSTM do multi-task learning (Caruana, 1993). In
multi-task learning, the induction of a model for one
task is used as a regularizer on the induction of a
model for another task. Caruana (1993) did multi-
task learning by doing parameter sharing across sev-
eral deep networks, letting them share hidden layers;
a technique also used by Collobert et al. (2011) for
various NLP tasks. These models train task-specific
classifiers on the output of deep networks (informed
by the task-specific losses). We extend their models
by moving to sequence prediction and allowing the
task-specific sequence models to also be deep mod-
els.

4 Experiments

4.1 Gaze data

We use the Dundee Corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003) as
our eye-tracking corpus with tokenization and mea-
sures similar to the Dundee Treebank (Barrett et al.,
2015). The corpus contains eye-tracking recordings
of ten native English-speaking subjects reading 20
newspaper articles from The Independent. We use
data from nine subjects for training and one subject
for development. We do not evaluate the gaze pre-
diction because the task is only included as a way of
regularizing the compression model.

4.2 Compression data

We use three different sentence compression
datasets, ZIFF-DAVIS (Knight and Marcu, 2002),
BROADCAST (Clarke and Lapata, 2006), and the
publically available subset of GOOGLE (Filippova et
al., 2015). The first two consist of manually com-
pressed newswire text in English, while the third is
built heuristically from pairs of headlines and first
sentences from newswire, resulting in the most ag-
gressive compressions, as exemplified in Table 1.
We present the dataset characteristics in Table 2. We
use the datasets as released by the authors and do
not apply any additional pre-processing. The CCG
supertagging data comes from CCGbank,1 and we
use sections 0-18 for training and section 19 for de-
velopment.

4.3 Baselines and system

Both the baseline and our systems are three-layer
bi-LSTM models trained for 30 iterations with pre-
trained (SENNA) embeddings. The input and hid-
den layers are 50 dimensions, and at the output
layer we predict sequences of two labels, indicating
whether to delete the labeled word or not. Our base-
line (BASELINE-LSTM) is a multi-task learning

bi-LSTM predicting both CCG supertags and sen-
tence compression (word deletion) at the outer layer.
Our first extension is MULTITASK-LSTM predict-
ing CCG supertags, sentence compression, and read-
ing measures from the outer layer. CASCADED-
LSTM, on the other hand, predicts CCG supertags
and reading measures from the initial layer, and sen-
tence compression at the outer layer.

4.4 Results and discussion

Our results are presented in Table 3. We observe
that across all three datasets, including all three
annotations of BROADCAST, gaze features lead to
improvements over our baseline 3-layer bi-LSTM.
Also, CASCADED-LSTM is consistently better than
MULTITASK-LSTM. Our models are fully compet-
itive with state-of-the-art models. For example, the
best model in Elming et al. (2013) achieves 0.7207
on ZIFF-DAVIS, Clarke and Lapata (2008) achieves
0.7509 on BROADCAST,2 and the LSTM model in
Filippova et al. (2015) achieves 0.80 on GOOGLE
with much more training data. The high numbers on
the small subset of GOOGLE reflects that newswire
headlines tend to have a fairly predictable relation to

pact of the gaze information becomes stronger, con-
sistently favouring the cascaded architecture, and
with improvements using both first pass duration
and regression duration, the late measure associated
with interpretation of content. Our results indicate
that multi-task learning can help us take advantage
of inherently noisy human processing data across
tasks and thereby maybe reduce the need for task-
specific data collection.
