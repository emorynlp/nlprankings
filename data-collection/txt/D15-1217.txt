Abstract

This paper focuses on language modeling
with adequate robustness to support differ-
ent domain tasks. To this end, we propose
a hierarchical latent word language model
(h-LWLM). The proposed model can be
regarded as a generalized form of the stan-
dard LWLMs. The key advance is in-
troducing a multiple latent variable space
with hierarchical structure. The structure
can flexibly take account of linguistic phe-
nomena not present in the training data.
This paper details the definition as well
as a training method based on layer-wise
inference and a practical usage in natural
language processing tasks with an approx-
imation technique. Experiments on speech
recognition show the effectiveness of h-
LWLM in out-of domain tasks.

1 Introduction

Language models (LMs) are essential for auto-
matic speech recognition or statistical machine
translation (Rosenfeld, 2000). The performance of
LMs strongly depends on quality and quantity of
their training data. Superior performance is usu-
ally obtained by using enormous domain-matched
training data sets to construct LMs (Brants et
al., 2007). Unfortunately, in many cases, large
amounts of domain-matched training data sets are
not available. Therefore, LM technology that can
robustly work for domains that differ from that of
the training data is needed (Goodman, 2001).

For robust language modeling, several tech-
nologies have been proposed. Fundamental tech-
niques are smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1999)
and clustering (Brown et al., 1992). Other solu-
tions are Bayesian modeling (Teh, 2006) and en-
semble modeling (Xu and Jelinek, 2004; Emami
and Jelinek, 2005). Moreover, continuous rep-
resentation of words in neural network LMs can

also support robust modeling (Bengio et al., 2003;
Mikolov et al., 2010). However, previous works
are focused on maximizing performance in the
same domain as that of the training data. In other
words, it is uncertain that these technologies ro-
bustly support out-of domain tasks.

In contrast, latent words LMs (LWLMs) (De-
schacht et al., 2012) are clearly effective for out-
of domain tasks. We employed the LWLM to
speech recognition and the resulting performance
was significantly superior in out-of domain tasks
while the performance was comparable in domain-
matched task to conventional LMs (Masumura et
al., 2013a; Masumura et al., 2013b). LWLMs
are generative models that employ a latent word
space. The latent space can flexibly take into ac-
count relationships between words and the model-
ing helps to efficiently increase the robustness to
out-of domain tasks (Sec. 2).

In this paper, we focus on LWLMs and aim to
make them more flexible for greater robustness to
out-of domain tasks. To this end, this paper takes
note of a fact that standard LWLM simply repre-
sents the latent space as n-gram model of latent
words. However, function and meaning of words
are essentially hierarchical and upper layers ought
to be useful to increase the robustness to out-of
domain tasks. The conventional LWLMs do not
model the hierarchy, while the latent words are
used to represent function and meaning of words.
Thus, we tried to model the hierarchy in the latent
space by estimating a latent word of a latent word
recursively.

This paper proposes a novel LWLM with mul-
tiple latent word spaces that are hierarchically
structured; we call it the hierarchical LWLM (h-
LWLM). The proposed model can be regarded
as a generalized form of the standard LWLMs.
The hierarchical structure can take into account
the abstraction process of function and meaning
of words. Therefore, it can be expected that h-

LWLMs flexibly calculate generative probability
for unseen words unlike non-hierarchical LWLMs.
To create the hierarchical latent word structure
from training data sets, we also propose a layer-
wise inference. The inference is inspired by a
deep Boltzmann machine (Salakhutdinov and Hin-
ton, 2009) that stacks up restricted Boltzmann ma-
chines (Hinton et al., 2006). In addition, we detail
an n-gram approximation technique to apply the
proposed model to practical natural language pro-
cessing tasks (see Sec. 3).

In experiments, we construct LMs from sponta-
neous lecture task data and apply them to a contact
center dialogue task and a voice mail task as out-
of domain tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed
method is shown by perplexity and speech recog-
nition evaluation (Sec. 4).

2 Latent Words Language Models

LWLMs are generative models with single latent
word space (Deschacht et al., 2012). The latent
word is represented as a specific word that is se-
lected from the entire vocabulary. Thus, the num-
ber of latent words equals the number of observed
words.

Bayesian modeling of LWLM produces the gen-
erative probability of observed word sequence
w = w1, · · · , wK as:

P (w) =
∫
θ

K∏
k=1

∑
hk

P (wk|hk, θ)

P (hk|lk, θ)P (θ)dθ, (1)

where θ indicates a model parameter of the
LWLM, h = h1, · · · , hK denotes a latent
word sequence and lk denotes context latent
words hk−n+1, · · · , hk−1. P (hk|lk, θ) repre-
sents the transition probability which can be ex-
pressed by an n-gram model for latent words, and
P (wk|hk,θ) represents the emission probability
that models the dependency between the observed
word and the latent word. More details are shown
in previous works (Deschacht et al., 2012; Ma-
sumura et al., 2013a; Masumura et al., 2013b).

3 Hierarchical LWLMs

3.1 Definition

This paper introduces h-LWLM. The proposed
model has multiple latent word spaces in a hier-
archical structure. Thus, it assumes that there is

a latent word behind a latent word. The proposed
model can be regarded as a generalized form of
the standard LWLM. Thus, standard LWLMs cor-
respond to h-LWLMs with just one layer. The la-
tent words in all layers are represented as a specific
word that is selected from the entire vocabulary.

A graphic rendering of h-LWLM is shown in
Figure 1. In a generative process of the h-LWLM,
a latent word in the highest layer is first generated
depending on its context latent words. Next, a la-
tent word in a lower layer is recursively generated
depending on the latent word in the upper layer.
Finally, an observed word is generated depending
on the latent word in the lowest layer.

Bayesian modeling of h-LWLM produces the
following generative probability:

in the m-th layer. P (h(M)k |l(M)k ,Θ) represents
the transition probability which is expressed by n-
gram model for latent words in the highest layer.
P (h(m)k |h(m+1)k ,Θ) and P (wk|h(1)k ,Θ) represent
the emission probabilities that respectively model
the dependency between latent words in two layers
and the dependency between the observed word
and the latent word in the lowest layer.

As the integral with respect to Θ is analytically

The probability distribution can be approximated
using T instances of point estimated parameter;
Θt indicates the t-th point estimated parameter.

3.2 Parameter Inference

This paper proposes a layer-wise inference pro-
cedure for constructing h-LWLMs from training
data. The detailed procedure is shown in Algo-
rithm 1, and Figure 2 shows an image representa-
tion of the procedure as increased with the number
of layers. In the procedure, LWLM structure is re-
cursively accumulated by estimating a latent word
sequence in an upper layer from a latent word se-
quence in the lower layer.

Line 4 in Algorithm 1 denotes the key proce-
dure of estimating a latent word sequence in an up-
per layer from a latent word sequence in the lower

layer. θ(m) denotes model parameter of LWLM
structure in m-th layer; it can be defined from both
h(m) and h(m−1). For the inference of h(m) from
h(m−1), Gibbs sampling is suitable (Casella and
George, 1992; Robert et al., 1993; Scott, 2002).
Gibbs sampling picks a new value for h(m)k ac-
cording to its probability distribution which is es-
timated from both h(m)−k and h

(m−1). h(m)−k repre-
sents all latent words in the m-th layer except for
h

(m)
k . The probability distribution is given by:

P (h(m)k |h(m)−k , h(m−1),θ(m))
∝ P (h(m−1)k |h(m)k , θ(m))

k+n−1∏
j=k

P (h(m)j |l(m)j , θ(m)). (4)

For the inference, the prior distribution is neces-
sary for each probability distribution. Usually, a
hierarchical Pitman-Yor prior (Teh, 2006) is used
for each transition probability and a Dirichlet prior
(MacKay and Peto, 1994) is used for each emis-
sion probability.

As shown in line 6, t-th point estimated param-
eter Θt indicates parameters of each LWLM for
all layers in t-th iteration. The transition proba-
bilities except for M -th layer are only used in the
layer-wise inference procedure.

3.3 Usage

It is impractical to directly apply the h-LWLM to
natural language processing tasks since the pro-
posed model has multiple latent word spaces and
we have to consider all possible latent word as-
signment for calculating generative probabilities.
Therefore, this paper introduces an n-gram ap-
proximation technique as well as that for standard
LWLM (Masumura et al., 2013a).

6: end for
7: wk ∼ P (wk|h(1)k ,Θt)

The n-gram approximation is conducted as fol-
lowing steps. First, a lot of text data that permit h-
LWLMs to be approximated by n-gram structure
is generated by random sampling using trained
h-LWLM. Next, an n-gram model is constructed
from the generated data. The random sampling is
based on Algorithm 2. The sampled data w in
line 9 is only used for n-gram model estimation.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Conditions

Our basic assumption is domain-matched train-
ing data is not available. Thus, for LM train-
ing, we used the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese
(CSJ) whose domain is a spontaneous lecture task
(Maekawa et al., 2000). We divided CSJ into a
training set and a small validation set (Valid). The
validation set was used for optimizing several hy-
per parameters of LMs. For evaluation, a contact
center dialogue task (Test 1) and a voice mail task
(Test 2) were prepared. In contact center dialogue
task, two speakers, an operator and a customer,
talked to each other as in call center dialogues. 24
phone calls (24 operator channels and 24 customer
channels) were used in the evaluation. In the voice
mail task, a person spoke small voice messages us-
ing a smart phone. 237 messages are used in the
evaluation. The training data had about 7M words,
the vocabulary size was about 80K. The validation
data size and test data size (both tasks) were about
20K words.

For speech recognition evaluation, we prepared
an acoustic model based on hidden Markov mod-
els with deep neural networks (DNN-HMM) (Hin-
ton et al., 2012). The DNN-HMM had 8 hidden

layers with 2048 nodes. The speech recognizer
was a weighted finite state transducer (WFST) de-
coder (Mohri et al., 2001; Hori et al., 2007).

As a baseline, 3-gram LM with interpolated
Kneser-Ney smoothing (MKN) (Kneser and Ney,
1995) and 3-gram hierarchical Pitman-Yor LM
(HPY) (Huang and Yor, 2007) were constructed
from the training data. We also trained a class-
based recurrent neural network LM with 500 hid-
den nodes and 500 classes (RNN) for comparison
to state-of-the art language modeling (Mikolov et
al., 2011). In addition, we constructed 3-gram
standard LWLM and 3-gram h-LWLMs (LW). LW
with 1 layer represents standard LWLM, and LW
with 2-5 layers represent proposed h-LWLMs.
The number of instances was set to 10 for each LW.
For their n-gram approximation, we generated one
billion words and approximated each as a 3-gram
HPYLM. Moreover, we constructed interpolated
model with LW and HPY (LW+HPY).

4.2 Results

Figure 3 shows the relation between number of
layers in h-LWLM and perplexity (PPL) reduc-
tion for each condition. In addition, Table 1 shows
speech recognition results in terms of word error
rate (WER) for each condition. RNN was only
tested in PPL evaluation as RNN cannot be con-
verted into WFST format.

For the validation set (same domain as that of
training set), PPL was not improved by the hier-
archical structure in LW. LW is comparable to MKN
and HPY, and inferior to RNN in terms of PPL. On
the other hand, in test sets (out-of domain tasks),
PPL improved with the increase in the number of
layers in LW. LW with 5 layers was superior to
1 layer in terms of PPL and WER. The best re-
sults were obtained by LW+HPY with 5 layers. In
fact, when we generated one billion words using
a trained LWLM or trained h-LWLM, the num-
ber of observed trigrams in h-LWLM with 5 lay-
ers was 101M while the number of observed tri-
grams in non-hierarchical LWLM was 94M. Thus,
h-LWLM can generate unseen words unlike non-
hierarchical LWLM. Moreover, trigram coverage
in each test data slightly increased with number
of layers. These results show that h-LWLM with
multiple layers offers robust performance not pos-
sible with other models while its performance in
the same domain as that of training data was not
improved. As a result, LW+HPY with 5 layers

performed significantly better than MKN, HPY and

5 Conclusions

This paper proposed h-LWLM for robust model-
ing and detailed its definition, inference proce-
dure, and approximation method. The proposed
model has a hierarchical latent word space and
it can flexibly handle linguistic phenomena not
present in the training data. Our experiments
showed that h-LWLM offers improved robustness
to out-of domain tasks; h-LWLM is also superior
to standard LWLM in terms of PPL and WER.
Furthermore, our approach is significantly supe-
rior to the conventional n-gram models or the re-
current neural network LM in out-of domain tasks.
