Abstract

In this paper, we present and compare
various centrality measures for graph-
based keyphrase extraction. Through ex-
periments carried out on three standard
datasets of different languages and do-
mains, we show that simple degree cen-
trality achieve results comparable to the
widely used TextRank algorithm, and that
closeness centrality obtains the best results
on short documents.

1 Introduction

Keyphrases are the words and phrases that pre-
cisely and compactly represent the content of a
document. Keyphrases are useful for a variety of
tasks such as summarization (Zha, 2002), informa-
tion retrieval (Jones and Staveley, 1999) and docu-
ment clustering (Han et al., 2007). However, many
documents do not come with manually assigned
keyphrases. This is because assigning keyphrases
to documents is very costly and time consuming.
As a consequence, automatic keyphrase extraction
has attracted considerable attention over the last
few years.

Previous works fall into two categories: super-
vised and unsupervised methods. The idea behind
supervised methods is to recast keyphrase extrac-
tion as a binary classification task (Witten et al.,
1999). Unsupervised approaches proposed so far
have involved a number of techniques, including
language modeling (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003),
clustering (Liu et al., 2009) and graph-based rank-
ing (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). While supervised
approaches have generally proven more success-
ful, the need for training data and the bias towards
the domain on which they are trained remain two
critical issues.

In this work, we focus on graph-based methods
for keyphrase extraction. Given a document, these

methods construct a word graph from which the
most important nodes are selected as keyphrases.
TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a ranking
algorithm based on the concept of eigenvector cen-
trality, is usually applied to compute the impor-
tance of the nodes in the graph. Here, centrality
is used to estimate the importance of a word in a
document.

The concept of centrality in a graph has been
extensively studied in the field of social network
analysis and many different measures were pro-
posed, see (Opsahl et al., 2010) for a review. Sur-
prisingly, very few attempts have been made to ap-
ply such measures to keyphrase extraction. (Lit-
vak et al., 2011) is one of them, where degree cen-
trality is used to select keyphrases. However, they
evaluate their method indirectly through a summa-
rization task, and to our knowledge there are no
published experiments using other centrality mea-
sures for keyphrase extraction. In this study, we
conduct a systematic evaluation of the most well-
known centrality measures applied to the task of
keyphrase extraction on three standard evaluation
datasets of different languages and domains1.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We first briefly review the previous work, followed
by a description of the centrality measures. Next,
we present our experiments and results and con-
clude with a discussion.

Graph-based keyphrase extraction has received
much attention recently and many different ap-
proaches have been proposed (Mihalcea and Ta-
rau, 2004; Wan and Xiao, 2008a; Wan and Xiao,
2008b; Liang et al., 2009; Tsatsaronis et al.,
2010; Liu et al., 2010). All of these approaches
use a graph representation of the documents in

which nodes are words or phrases, and edges rep-
resent co-occurrence or semantic relations. The
importance of each node is computed using Tex-
tRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), a graph-based
ranking algorithm derived from Google’s PageR-
ank (Page et al., 1999). Words corresponding to
the top ranked nodes are then selected and assem-
bled to generate keyphrases.

Most previous studies focus on building a more
accurate graph representation from the content of
the documents (Tsatsaronis et al., 2010) or adding
features to TextRank (Liu et al., 2010), but very
few tried to use other existing centrality mea-
sures. The only works we are aware of are that
of Litvak and Last (2008) that applied the HITS
algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999), and Litvak et al.
(2011) in which TextRank and degree centrality
are compared. However, both works were evalu-
ated against a summarization dataset by checking
whether extracted keyphrases appear in reference
summaries. This methodology is somewhat unre-
liable, as a word that occurs in a summary is not
necessarily a keyphrase (e.g. experiments, results).

3 Keyphrase extraction

Extracting keyphrases from a document can be di-
vided into three steps. First, a word graph is con-
structed from the document. The importance of
each word is then determined using a centrality
measure. Lastly, keyphrase candidates are gen-
erated and ranked based on the words they con-
tain. The following sections describe each of these
steps in detail.

3.1 Graph construction

Given a document, the first step consists in build-
ing a graph representation from its content. An
undirected word graph is constructed for each doc-
ument, in which nodes are words and edges repre-
sent co-occurrence relations within a window of
maximumN words. Words added to the graph are
restricted with syntactic filters, which select only
lexical units of a certain Part-of-Speech (nouns
and adjectives). Edges are weighted according to
the co-occurrence count of the words they connect.
Following (Wan and Xiao, 2008b), we set the co-
occurrence window size to 10 in all our experi-
ments.

3.2 Centrality measures

Once the word graph is constructed, centrality
measures are computed to assign a score to each
node. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with a set of ver-
tices (nodes) V and a set of edges E. Starting with
degree centrality, this section describes the rank-
ing models we will be using in this study.

Degree centrality is defined as the number of
edges incident upon a node. Applied to a word
graph, the degree of a node Vi represents the num-
ber of words that co-occur with the word corre-
sponding to Vi. Let N (Vi) be the set of nodes
connected to Vi, the degree centrality of a node Vi
is given by:

CD(Vi) =
|N (Vi)|
|V | − 1

(1)

Closeness centrality is defined as the inverse
of farness, i.e. the sum of the shortest distances
between a node and all the other nodes. Let
distance(Vi, Vj) be the shortest distance be-
tween nodes Vi and Vj (in our case, computed us-
ing inverted edge weights to use co-occurrence in-
formation), the closeness centrality of a node Vi is
given by:

CC(Vi) =
|V | − 1∑

Vj∈V distance(Vi, Vj)
(2)

Betweenness centrality quantifies the number
of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest
path between two other nodes. Let σ(Vj, Vk) be
the number of shortest paths from node Vj to node
Vk, and σ(Vj, Vk|Vi) the number of those paths
that pass through node Vi. The betweenness cen-
trality of a node Vi is given by:

CB(Vi) =

∑
Vi 6=Vj 6=Vk∈V

σ(Vj,Vk|Vi)
σ(Vj,Vk)

(|V | − 1)(|V | − 2)/2
(3)

Eigenvector centrality measures the central-
ity of a node as a function of the centralities of
its neighbors. Unlike degree, it accounts for the
notion that connections to high-scoring nodes are
more important than those to low-scoring ones.
Let wji be the weight of the edge between nodes
Vj and Vi and λ a constant, the eigenvector cen-
trality of a node Vi is given by:

CE(Vi) =
1

λ

∑
Vj∈N (Vi)

wji × CE(Vj) (4)

835



TextRank is based on the eigenvector centrality
measure and implements the concept of “voting”.
Let d be a damping factor (set to 0.85 as in (Mihal-
cea and Tarau, 2004)), the TextRank score S(Vi)
of a node Vi is initialized to a default value and
computed iteratively until convergence using the
following equation:

S(Vi) = (1−d)+

(

∑
Vj∈N (Vi)

wji × S(Vj)∑

3.3 Keyphrase selection

Selecting keyphrases is a two step process. First,
keyphrase candidates are extracted from the doc-
ument. Sequences of adjacent words, restricted to
nouns and adjectives only, are considered as candi-
dates. Extracting sequences of adjacent words in-
stead of n-grams ensure that keyphrase candidates
are grammatically correct but entail a lower recall.

The score of a candidate keyphrase k is com-
puted by summing the scores of the words it con-
tains normalized by its length + 1 to favor longer
n-grams (see equation 6).

score(k) =

∑
word∈k Score(word)

length(k) + 1
(6)

Keyphrase candidates are then ranked and re-
dundant candidates filtered out. Two candidates
are considered redundant if they have a same
stemmed form (e.g. “precisions” and “precision”
are both stemmed to “precis”).

4 Experimental settings

4.1 Datasets

As mentioned by (Hasan and Ng, 2010), it is
essential to evaluate keyphrase extraction meth-
ods on multiple datasets to fully understand their
strengths and weaknesses. Accordingly, we use
three different datasets in our experiments. An
overview of each dataset is given in Table 1.

The Inspec dataset (Hulth, 2003) is a collection
of abstracts from journal papers. We use the 500
abstracts designated as the test set and the set of
uncontrolled keyphrases.

The Semeval dataset (Kim et al., 2010) is
composed of scientific articles collected from the
ACM Digital Library. We use the 100 articles of
the test set and its set of combined author- and
reader-assigned keyphrases.

The DEFT dataset (Paroubek et al., 2012) is
made of French scientific articles published in so-
cial science journals. We use the 93 articles of the
test set and its set of author-assigned keyphrases.

Table 1: Overview of the three datasets we use in
our experiments.

4.2 Pre-processing
For each dataset, we apply the following pre-
processing steps: sentence segmentation, tokeni-
sation and Part-of-Speech tagging. For the lat-
ter, we use the Stanford POS-tagger (Toutanova et
al., 2003) for English and MElt (Denis and Sagot,
2009) for French. We use the networkx2 package
to compute the centrality measures.

4.3 Evaluation measures
The performance of each centrality measure is
evaluated with precision, recall and f-score at
the top 10 keyphrases. Candidate and reference
keyphrases are stemmed to reduce the number
of mismatches. Consistent with (Hasan and Ng,
2010), we also report the performance of each cen-
trality measure in terms of precision-recall curves
for the three datasets. To generate the curves, we
vary the number of extracted keyphrases from 1 to
the total number of keyphrase candidates.

5 Results

Table 2 presents the performance of each central-
ity measure on the three datasets. Overall, we ob-
serve that the best results are obtained using de-
gree which is the simplest centrality measure both
conceptually and computationally. Closeness ob-
tains the best results on Inspec and significantly
outperforms TextRank. However, it yields the
worst performance on the other two datasets. This
suggests that closeness is best suited for short doc-
uments (Inspec documents are 136 tokens long on
average).

Figure 1: Precision-recall curves for each centrality measure on the three datasets.

To get a better understanding of the perfor-
mance for each centrality measure, we report in
Figure 1 their precision-recall curves for each of
the three datasets. Moreover, to estimate how each
measure performs in terms of f-score, we also plot
the curves corresponding to different levels of f-
score. Again, we observe that the best measure
for the Inspec dataset is closeness. For the other
two datasets, there is no centrality measure which
overall performs best. We note that the maximum
recall is almost the same for the three datasets.

Interestingly, degree and TextRank achieve sim-
ilar performance on the three datasets. The reason
for this is that TextRank is derived from PageR-
ank which was shown to be proportional to the de-
gree distribution for undirected graphs (Grolmusz,
2012). Degree centrality, whose time complex-
ity isΘ(V2), can therefore advantageously replace
TextRank for keyphrase extraction.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a comparison of five
centrality measures for graph-based keyphrase ex-
traction. Using three standard datasets of differ-
ent languages and domains, we showed that de-
gree centrality, despite being conceptually the sim-
plest measure, achieves results comparable to the
widely used TextRank algorithm. Moreover, re-
sults show that closeness significantly outperforms
the other centrality measures on short documents.
