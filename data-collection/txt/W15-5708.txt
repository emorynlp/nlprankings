Abstract

Despite the common assumption that word sense disambiguation (WSD) should help to improve
lexical choice and improve the quality of the output of machine translation systems, how to
successfully integrate word senses into such systems remains an unanswered question. While
significant improvements have been reported using reformulated approaches to the disambigua-
tion task itself – most notably in predicting translations of full phrases as opposed to the senses
of single words – little improvement or encouragement has been gleaned from the incorporation
of traditional WSD into machine translation.

In this paper, we present preliminary results that suggest that incorporating output from WSD
as contextual features in a maxent-based translation model yields a slight improvement in the
quality of machine translation and is potentially a step in the right direction, in contrast to other
approaches to introducing word senses into a machine translation system which significantly
impede its performance.

1 Introduction

Ambiguity is a common problem in language, caused by the phenomena of identical words having mul-
tiple, distinct meanings (Xiong and Zhang, 2014). To use a classic example, the word ‘bank’ could be
interpreted in the sense of the financial institution or as the slope of land at the side of a river, depending
on the context in which it is used. In natural language processing (NLP), word sense disambiguation
(WSD) refers to the process of solving this problem by determining the ‘sense’ or meaning of a word
when used in a particular context (Agirre and Edmonds, 2006).

In computational terms, WSD is a classification task, where the context in which a target word is
used provides evidence that helps to determine which class of words – sense – it should be assigned to
(Agirre and Edmonds, 2006). Most approaches to WSD in recent years have been ‘knowledge-based’,
with those classes of words stored in lexical ontologies such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), where the
collective meanings of open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) are grouped together
as ‘synsets’. For tasks such as machine translation, ambiguous terms are a major potential source of
errors, as identical words with different meanings will normally have different target translations (Xiong
and Zhang, 2014). Thus, it has long been assumed that in order for a machine translation system to be
optimally successful, it must incorporate some kind of WSD component (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).

Most attempts to integrate WSD components into machine translation systems have met with mixed –
and usually limited – success. Early attempts at ‘projecting’ word senses directly into a machine transla-
tion system (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) were followed by a complete reformulation of the disambiguation
process as a multi-word ‘phrase sense’ disambiguation approach, yeilding some improvements in transla-
tion quality (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). More recently, a ‘word sense induction’ approach that assigns word
senses without the need for predefined sense inventories (such as WordNets) has been explored (Xiong
and Zhang, 2014), but the question of whether pure word senses from traditional, knowledge-based WSD
approaches can be useful for machine translation still remains.

In this paper, we demonstrate that by including the output from WSD as a feature in a maximum en-
tropy (maxent)-based translation model, small gains in machine translation from English to Portuguese
can be obtained. The contribution of our work, albeit preliminary in nature, is in showing these gains,
however small, to be possible without having to reformulate WSD or drastically alter the way disam-
biguation is performed – the features added to the transfer model are direct outputs of a state-of-the-art
WSD algorithm, without any kind of intermediary conversion or reformulation of either the word senses
or the algorithm that delivers them.

We first explore previous efforts to integrate word senses into machine translation (Section 2), before
describing our own approaches to the problem (Section 3). Next, we present our evaluation of these
approaches, comparing different methods of integrating the output from a WSD process into a machine
translation system (Section 4). Finally, we discuss our findings (Section 5) before making our conclu-
sions (Section 6).

2 Related Work

Early work from Carpaut and Wu (2005) presented empirical results that cast doubt on the common
assumption that the disambiguation of word senses could help to improve the quality of machine transla-
tion systems. They demonstrated that many of the contextual features important to WSD algorithms are
implicit in the language models that are trained to perform machine translation, making them WSD mod-
els in their own right (Carpuat and Wu, 2005). Despite acknowledging that dedicated WSD algorithms
are usually based on rich semantic data and that this should enable better predictions of lexical choice to
be made, they showed a machine translation system trained on complete parallel sentences (rather than
isolated target words as in WSD) to yield higher BLEU scores than a system where WSD output was
forced into the translation model (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).

Based on these outcomes, a reformulated disambiguation process was proposed, with multi-word
phrases the target as opposed to single words (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). Leveraging the fact that ma-
chine translation models are trained using contextual features from full sentences already, this ‘phrase
sense disambiguation’ approach was designed to “generalize WSD to multi-word targets” and to in-
corporate the “crucial assumptions” that underly the sentence-based translation models into the sense
disambiguation process as well (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). Across a number of evaluation metrics for
machine translation, the phrase sense disambiguation approach was found to yield improved transation
quality, suggesting that the sentence-based translation models used by machine translation systems can
benefit from the addition of phrase-based (rather than word-based) sense disambiguation (Carpuat and
Wu, 2007).

Further attempts to reformulate WSD into a more phrase-based concept followed. Chanel et al (2007)
described having successfully integrated WSD into a machine translation system to obtain significantly
improved results, but actually create their ‘senses’ by extracting English translations from full phrases in
Chinese and using them as proposed translations . Inspired by traditional approaches to WSD, Giménez
and Màrquez (2007) also advocated the move from ‘word translation’ to ‘phrase translation’, describing
how lists of possible translations of a single source phrase can help to predict the correct translations of
complete phrases in a given target language.

Recently, a renewed interest in exploring whether traditional, single word-based WSD can be useful
for machine translation has emerged. Xiong and Zhang (2014) use the related technique of ‘word sense
induction’ (WSI) to investigate whether or not pure word senses can be integrated into machine transla-
tion in such a way as to yield improvements in translation quality, being successful in their approach to
predicting the senses of target words (rather than predicting their translations, as with the phrase-based
approaches to disambiguation) (Xiong and Zhang, 2014). However, WSI automatically induces senses
of words by clustering them together using their neighbouring words as context, without the need for a
predefined sense inventory as in traditional WSD (Xiong and Zhang, 2014). The question still remains
– how can word senses disambiguated using the rich semantic ontologies (such as WordNet) on which
traditional WSD is based be successfully integrated into machine translation systems?

3 Description

This section outlines our implementation of WSD as part of a machine translation process, including
descriptions of the graph-based algorithm we use to perform the WSD, the machine translation system
and framework into which we implement it, and the two approaches we have taken to making use of
the information output by the WSD process: 1) forcing information into the input sentences (directly
affecting the alignment of words before the translation model is trained), and 2) including information as
features in a maxent-based translation model (which does not affect word alignment but rather directly
influences the training of the translation model).

3.1 WSD algorithm - UKB
To perform WSD we use UKB, a collection of tools and algorithms for performing graph-based WSD
over a pre-existing knowledge base (Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Agirre et al., 2014). Graph-based WSD, as
pioneered by a number of researchers (Navigli and Velardi, 2005; Mihalcea, 2005; Sinha and Mihalcea,
2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007; Agirre and Soroa, 2008), allows knowledge bases such as WordNets
to be represented as weighted graphs, where word senses correspond to nodes and the relationships or
dependencies between pairs of senses correspond to the edges between nodes. The strength of the edge
between two nodes, corresponding to the relationship or dependency between two synsets, can then be
calculated using semantic similarity measures such as the Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986).

UKB uses graph-based representations of knowledge bases to choose the most likely sense of a word
in a given context, based on the dependencies between nodes in the graph (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).
Nodes (senses) ‘recommend’ each other based on their own importance – with the importance of any
given node being higher or lower depending on the importance of other nodes which recommend it – and
then follow a ‘random walk’ over the rest of the graph based on the importance of the nodes to whose
edges they are attached (Mihalcea, 2005; Agirre and Soroa, 2009). The final probability of a random
walk from the target word’s node ending on any other node in the graph determines the most appropriate
(probable) sense of the target word.

We choose to use UKB in our work for two reasons:

• UKB includes tools for automatically creating graph-based representations of knowledge bases in
WordNet-style formats.

• The algorithm used by UKB for performing WSD over the graph itself has been consistently shown
to produce results in line with or above the state-of-the-art (Agirre and Soroa, 2009; Agirre et al.,
2014).

For the purpose of our work, we are thus able to perform highly-efficient WSD over an accurate
graph-based representation of our chosen knowledge base (WordNet), meaning that any differences in the
results of our integration of disambiguated output into the machine translation system can be confidently
attributed to the integration process, rather than to the quality of the WSD output itself.

3.2 Machine Translation system - TectoMT
The machine translation system used in our work is TectoMT, a multi-purpose open source NLP frame-
work that allows different software modules and tools to be integrated with each other (Popel and
Žabokrtský, 2010)1. The framework is based on individual modules (known as ‘blocks’) that allow
new or existing tools to be created or ‘wrapped’ in such a way that they can be easily integrated at vari-
ous stages in a larger pipeline. These blocks are re-usable in different contexts and combinations (known
as ‘scenarios’) to perform a variety of NLP tasks and are designed to be language-independent where
possible, reducing the amount of repeated, expensive and time-consuming extra work usually needed to
integrate tools.

For machine translation, TectoMT breaks down the source language and reconstructs the target lan-
guage according to four layers of representation: the word layer (raw text), the morphological layer, the

1The TectoMT framework is now being developed under the name Treex: https://github.com/ufal/treex

66



analytical layer (shallow-syntax) and the tectogrammatical layer (deep-syntax). Different combinations
of blocks make up each of the three scenarios needed for machine translation – one for analysis (of the
source language), one for transfer (of tectogrammatical nodes from source to target language) and one
for synsthesis (of the target language).

3.3 Integrating WSD output into a TectoMT-based pipeline

The first step in integrating the output produced by the WSD process into the machine translation pipeline
is to wrap the WSD process as a block that can be included in user-created scenarios using the TectoMT
framework. This new block converts input sentences to a format suitable for the UKB algorithm, and
then performs WSD on each sentence using a graph-based representation of our chosen knowledge base,
WordNet. For each word disambiguated by UKB, the returned output consists of the 8-digit synset
identifier of the appropriate sense in WordNet chosen at the end of the random walk over the graph.

The TectoMT WSD block then maps this output back onto the input sentence, either as the synset
identifier returned by UKB, an ‘unknown’ tag (‘UNK’, given to UKB but not able to be disambiguated)
or a ‘not applicable’ tag (‘ ’, not open-class and not given to UKB). This mapped WSD output is encoded
into the analytical layer of each word in TectoMT as an attribute of the given word. Once words in the
analytical layer have been assigned word senses as attributes, there are two ways with which we have
experimented making use of this information for training actual translation models:

3.3.1 Forcing synset identifiers into input sentences prior to creating translation models

Forcing the synset identifiers produced by the WSD process onto the input sentences prior to creating
translation models is achieved by taking the synset identifier from the WSD attribute stored in the ana-
lytical layer for a given word and using it in place of the original lemma. During the training of transfer
models, when alignments are made between sentences from parallel corpora in the source and target
languages, it should be the case that the forced synset identifiers help to create more accurate alignments
between pairs of words based on their meanings, rather than solely their lexical form2. In this paper, we
investigate two possible ways to force a synset identifier onto the lemma:

• Replacing the lemma with the synset identifier (e.g. ‘word’ becomes ‘01234567’)

• Appending the synset identifier to the lemma (e.g. ‘word’ becomes ‘word 01234567’)

If we consider a link between the English word ‘table’ and the Portuguese word ‘mesa’, we may find
that this alignment is made when ‘table’ should have been interpreted as a table of results, not in the
sense of the piece of furniture which would correspond to ‘mesa’. Replacing the lemma ‘table’ with the
synset identifier for table in the sense of the piece of furniture should ensure a more accurate alignment
between the appropriate sense of the word table and the Portuguese word ‘mesa’. Appending the synset
identifier to the lemma is an extension of this technique which we hypothesized might avoid potential
problems concerning lexical choice.

For example, it might be that in some situations two words such as ‘table’ and ‘desk’ in English might
belong to the same synset, but correspond to different words (‘mesa’ and ‘secretária’ respectively) in
Portuguese. By replacing the English words by the synset identifier and aligning that with the Portuguese
words, we are essentially assigning the main lemma of the synset (e.g. ‘table’) to both Portuguese words,
which while being better than assigning the wrong sense of table altogether, is not quite as accurate
as aligning ‘desk’ to ‘secretária’. Hence, by appending the synset identifiers to the original lemmas
(e.g. aligning ‘table 01234567’ to ‘mesa’ and ‘desk 01234567’ to ‘secretária’), we are hopefully able to
constrain alignments to the correct sense of source language words without introducing problems relating
to lexical choice.

2For the work described in this paper, we make no assumption about the number of synset identifiers found in the training
corpus before using them to align words. This may be an interesting caveat to explore in future work.

67



3.3.2 Including synset identifiers as features of a maxent-based translation model
TectoMT leverages the alignments it finds between the words in pairs of sentences from a parallel corpus
to create and train maxent-based translation models, which are used later to perform machine translation
tasks. Maximum entropy (maxent) classifiers, which are used when the conditional independence of a set
of ‘features’ cannot be assumed, are common in NLP, where features such as neighbouring words usually
provide context and are therefore not independent. In TectoMT, for each word in the source language
that has more than one possible translation in the target language a maxent model exists to determine the
probability of any of those translations being correct based on contextual features such as neighbouring
words – words with only one translation have no ambiguity, and hence no need of a maxent model. For
statistical machine translation systems, previous research suggests that maxent-based translation models
are an effective way of leveraging the context provided by the neighbouring words of source sentences
(Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Bangalore et al., 2007).

In order for maxent models to be created, analysis must have been performed on both the source and
target languages, in order for the models to be trained based on aligned parallel treebanks of sentences
represented as tectogrammatical (deep-syntax) trees. The maxent model for each word is trained using a
list of ‘samples’, which are themselves vectors between contextual features in the source language‘node’
(the tectogrammatical representation of the given word) and an output label (e.g. the lemma of the given
word). Contextual features might include information (such as lemmas) from neighbouring nodes in the
tectogrammatical tree (such as parent or sibling nodes), which help to provide the context in which a
particular word was used.

The maxent model learns, using this information, to output the correct label (target language lemma)
given a particular vector of source language contextual features (e.g. a sentence that we want to translate).
With the output from the WSD process already stored as an attribute of the analytical layer by the WSD
block that we added to the TectoMT framework (and hence propagated to the tectogrammatical layer),
synset identifiers can also be added as source language contextual features of words. Thus, the maxent
model can in theory constrain the expected probability of a possible translation as determined by the
neighbouring words in context to the particular sense in which a given word was used.

4 Evaluation

This section describes our evaluation of how the results of translation from English to Portuguese using
our baseline TectoMT-based machine translation system are affected by our two approaches to including
information from WSD in the process:

• Forcing synset identifiers into input sentences prior to creating translation models:

– By replacing lemmas with synset identifiers
– By appending synset identifiers to lemmas

• Adding synset identifers as features in a maxent-based translation model:

– As features of single nodes (words)
– As features of single nodes plus their parent nodes
– As features of single nodes plus their sibling (to the left and right) nodes
– As features of single nodes plus their parent and sibling nodes

4.1 Experimental System Setup
In order to run the evaluation, we introduce different combinations of interchangable blocks to the anal-
ysis scenario in TectoMT, in order that WSD is performed and that its output (synset identifiers) can be
propagated from the analytical to the tectogrammatical layer, and thus included in the eventual transla-
tion model. As described in section 3.3.2, aligned parallel treebanks of sentences are needed in order for
maxent models to be created for target words, and so analysis scenarios are set up for both the source
language (English) and the target language (Portuguese). WSD, however, is only included on the source
language side (English).

nodes plus parent and sibling nodes

For both approaches, the WSD block is used to run the graph-based UKB algorithm (desribed in
section 3.1) over the source sentences in English. In order to use the algorithm, we create the required
dictionary files and corresponding graph from version 3.0 of the Princeton English WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998), comprising approximately 117,000 synsets. The 8 digit identifiers of any of these synsets can
be assigned by the algorithm to given words in an input text, based on the context provided by their
surrounding open class words.

For the adding synset identifiers as features in a maxent-based translation model approach, the inclu-
sion of the WSD block in the scenario is all that is needed – the synset identifiers it returns are included
in the analytical layer of each word, and from there propagated to the tectogrammatical layer and, finally,
the maxent model where they are called upon as features. For the forcing synset identifiers into input
sentences approach, two additional (interchangable) blocks are included in the scenario: 1) a block for
replacing a given lemma in the input sentence with the synset identifier returned by the WSD, and 2) a
block for appending the synset identifier returned by the WSD to a given lemma in the input sentence.

4.2 Training Corpus
Transfer models are trained over a small, in-domain corpus. The corpus primarily consists of 2000
sentences of questions and answers from a chat-based technology help service (1000 questions and 1000
answers). These sentences are sourced from a real-world company who employ human technicians to
provide technical assistance to their customers (technology users) through a chat interface. These 2000
sentences are supported by a number of aligned terms sourced from localized terminology data from
Microsoft (13,000 terms) and LibreOffice (995 terms), making the total size of our in-domain corpus
approximately 16,000 paired segments (of which 2000 are full sentences and approximately 14,000 are
paired terms). No development set or tuning steps are needed in the TectoMT-based pipeline.

4.3 Results of Including WSD Output in Machine Translation
By interchanging the different blocks incorporated into the analysis scenario of TectoMT to train different
translation models for evaluation, we can compare our two chosen approaches to including the output
from WSD in a machine translation system: 1) forcing synset identifiers into the input sentences prior
to creating translation models, and 2) adding synset identifers as features in a maxent-based translation
model. For all evaluations, we analyse the different translation models using a test corpus of 1000 full
answers to questions asked by people seeking assistance in resolving problems using technology, as per
the domain of the training corpus described in section 4.2.

Table 1 shows that when translating these 1000 sentences from English to Portuguese using a baseline
TectoMT system (without WSD), we achieve a BLEU score of 21.67. Using the first approach (forcing

69



sysnet identifers into the input sentences prior to creating translation models), the scores we obtain are
significantly lower than the baseline (at a 0.05 level of significance) – 20.46 when we replace lemmas
with synset identifiers, and 19.86 when appending the sysnet identifier to the lemma. Using the second
approach (adding synset identifiers as features in a maxent-based translation model) we obtain a BLEU
score of 21.69, very slightly above the baseline.

Table 2 shows our experimentation with adding different types of features into the maxent-model for
a given word: 1) synset identifiers from single nodes (the standard method, as used to obtain the score
in Table 1), 2) synset identifiers from single nodes plus the parent node in the tectogrammatical tree,
3) synset identifiers from single nodes plus the sibling (left and right) nodes, and 4) synset identifiers
from single nodes plus the parent and sibling nodes. With a baseline BLEU score of 21.67 and a slightly
improved score of 21.69 when including the synset identifiers of single nodes, as before, the table demon-
strates that adding the synset identifiers of sibling nodes yields a BLEU score of 21.68, slightly above
the baseline but slightly below single nodes only, while adding parent nodes alone or parent and sibling
nodes yields BLEU scores of 21.61 and 21.62 respectively, significantly and almost significantly lower
than the baseline (at a 0.05 level of significance).

5 Discussion

In addition to showing that adding synset identifiers as features in a maxent-based translation model
yields a BLEU score very slightly above our baseline TectoMT-based machine translation system –
suggesting that with some further tweaking output from WSD can be useful for machine translation,
without the need for any kind of intermediary reformulation or conversion – there are some interesting
outcomes from our evaluation. Namely, we found it surprising that:

• Using the first approach (forcing synset identifiers into the input sentences prior to creating the
tranlation models), appending synset identifiers to lemmas yielded worse results than replacing
lemmas with synset identifers.

• Using the second approach (adding synset identifiers as features in a maxent-based translation
model), adding the synset identifiers of the parent nodes as extra features in the maxent model
decreases the BLEU score.

A possible explanation for the weaker results obtained in general using the first approach is that maxent
models, as their description in section 3.3.2 demonstrates, already include lemmas from neighboring
nodes as contextual features, in much the same way as graph-based WSD algorithms such as UKB rely
on the open class words surrounding a given target word as context. The maxent model could be seen
as repeating a very similar task, and while it may not be as wholly dedicated to it as a WSD-specific
algorithm, we may find that the maxent models used in machine translation are “sufficiently accurate” so
that the output from WSD is only able to improve on the lexical choice offered by the maxent model in
a “relatively small proportion of cases” (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).

Taken in this context, and assuming as proposed by Carpaut and Wu (2005) that machine translation is
excessively dependent on the language models it trains, it could be the case that forcing synset identifiers
into the input sentences prior to creating translation models only introduces excessive data that cannot
really be put to any efficient use. This might also explain how appending synset identifiers to lemmas
yielded even lower results than replacing lemmas with synset identifiers – while the case made in section
3.3.1 for appending the synset identifiers in order to preserve lexical choice seems persuasive, it may
in fact be that as well as introducing a redundant synset identifier that cannot be put to much use, this
renders the lemma itself redundant (by way of being intrinsically tied to that identifier), thus increasing
the sparsity of the input sentences.

The second surprising outcome of our evaluation was the discovery that while adding the synset iden-
tifiers of nodes as features in a maxent model yields a slight improvement over the baseline BLEU score,
adding synset identifiers from parent nodes as well can have a significantly adverse effect on results (the
inclusion of sibling nodes seems to ‘limit the damage’ to a very small degree). This seems counterintu-
itive – introducing the output of WSD as a feature in the maxent model seems to yield an improvement,

70



as Xiong and Zhang (2014) also found when creating a sense-based translation model based on their re-
forumulated word sense induction approach, and one would expect that providing a maxent model with
more features would introduce more useful constraints.

As a possible explanation for this outcome, we consider that not all of the open class words UKB tries
to disambiguate will be assigned an appropriate synset identifier – a particular word may not have had an
entry in WordNet to begin with, or in a very small number of cases the synset identifier assigned by the
algorithm may not have been the correct one. For parent and sibling nodes – parent nodes in particular
– this inevitably means that for a given node whose synset identifier is included in the maxent model, it
might often be the case that its parent (and to a lesser extent sibling) nodes in the tectogrammatical tree
do not have synset identifiers of their own – we are probably not adding many synset identifiers anyway
by choosing to include the extra information from these nodes. We might also consider that if multiple
additional synset identifiers are all very different from each other, they might act as conflicting rather
than constraining information, thus increasing the overall redundancy or sparsity of the data included in
the maxent model.

6 Conclusions

We have presented preliminary findings that suggest that it is possible to improve machine translation
results by incorporating information about word senses, making direct use of the output of WSD tools
and without the need for any kind of intermediary reformulation or conversion of either the WSD tool
itself or its output. By including the output from WSD as features in a maxent-based translation model,
we obtain slightly higher BLEU scores than with a baseline version of the system running without these
added features (translating from English to Portuguese), indicating that these features can increase the
likelihood of pairings between words and phrases occuring in the translation model.

While the improvement we report is not statistically significant, we find any improvement at all to
be in contrast to other approaches we experimented with – replacing synset identifers with lemmas,
appending synset identifiers to lemmas, and including the synset identifiers of the parent nodes of words
as features in the maxent-based translation model – all of which produce results significantly below
our baseline machine translation system. While these results seem counterintuitive – more information
should provide more constraints on the probabilities of alignments and pairings between words being
made – we interpret them as showing that the extra data we introduce to the translation model with these
approaches has resulted in too much sparsity, rather than constraint. It would be interesting in future
work to explore whether a paraphrasing (Marton et al., 2009) or synonym-based approach as opposed to
a strictly word sense-based approach might yield different outcomes.

While the work we report in this paper is in a preliminary state, the small improvement achieved by
adding synset identifiers as features of single nodes in a maxent-based translation model does represent
a step in the right direction, and merits further discussion and experimentation. The results reported
here are based on a very controlled evaluation, trained on a small, in-domain corpus. We acknowledge
that training on large, open domain corpora such as Europarl might produce different results, and aim
to investigate this in the future. In addition, we also plan to explore how different types of word sense
information and different approaches to WSD itself, as well as alternative machine translation evaluation
metrics (possibly more semantically-oriented), might affect the gains we report using the ‘senses as
features’ approach we describe here.
