Abstract

We describe ongoing work aiming at de-
riving a multilingual controlled vocabulary
(German, French, Italian) from the com-
bined subject indices from 22 volumes of
a large-scale critical edition of historical
documents. The controlled vocabulary is
intended to support editors in assigning de-
scriptors to new documents and to support
users in retrieving documents of interest re-
gardless of the spelling or language variety
used in the documents.

1 Introduction

Until quite recently, most critical edition1 projects
produced printed books, even though the produc-
tion of these volumes has been supported by com-
puters since the 1960s, e.g., for concordancing,
collation, and statistical analyses, as well as for
bibliography management, text editing, and type-
setting (see, e.g., Froger (1970)).

Modern edition projects increasingly aim to pro-
duce digital editions that offer linking, dynamic
display of alternative readings, or the integration
of related images (in particular facsimiles of origi-
nal documents), audio, or video. However, the new
target medium does not just offer new possibili-
ties, but it also demands sometimes fundamental
changes in the editorial process.

One affected area is indexing. In printed books,
the manually constructed back-of-the-book index
is the only way for readers to access the contents
in a non-linear fashion. A good index is not merely
a list of words occurring in the text, but it specifies

1In a narrow sense, a critical edition is a scholarly edition
that tries to recover the most authentic version of a historical
text from extant sources. We use the term loosely to include
other types of scholarly editions, in particular diplomatic
editions.

concepts and introduces synonyms and, through
cross-references, related terms. The possibility to
perform full-text searches on digital texts therefore
does not render manually constructed indices ob-
solete, but complements them (see Savoy (2005)
for an evaluation in a comparable scenario). For
editions of historical texts, a manually constructed
index is indispensable, as spelling variation, mean-
ing shifts, and multilingualism make full-text re-
trieval difficult for both laypersons and experts.

In book form, collective editions of shorter texts,
such as letters, treaties, or charters, form one mono-
lithic entity. The electronic medium allows for
direct linking and repurposing of individual parts
(or content objects) of a collection in new con-
texts, so the individual edited text is much more
independent than it was in a printed volume. This
has direct implications for the construction of in-
dices: Traditionally, an index for a book is com-
piled when it is completed; thus, when selecting
keywords, the indexer does not consider individual
texts in isolation, but rather within the specific con-
text set by the book. An indexer may thus choose
one particular term for describing a concept over
another one because it occurs verbatim in the ma-
jority of texts; or an indexer may choose to leave
out certain possible index terms because they are
self-evident in the context of the book, e.g., the
index to an edition of letters is unlikely to contain
the index term letter.

In a digital edition, in contrast, index terms
should be rather thought of as metadata assigned
to individual content objects to enable retrieval and
reuse in different contexts. For example, if an edi-
tion of a letter is included in a thematic collection
containing various types of documents, it should
have the metadata information letter, as this may
be a distinguishing feature in this collection. It
also means that a collection may contain items

annotated by different editors, in contrast to back-
of-the-book indices, which are typically created by
a single indexer.

In order to ensure interoperability of index
terms, a controlled vocabulary should be used. We
define a controlled vocabulary in accordance with
ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 (ANSI/NISO, 2005) as
a set of canonical terms that are managed by an
authority according to certain rules; for multiple
terms referring to the same concept, a preferred
term (i.e., descriptor) is defined, and a term rep-
resenting various concepts is made unambiguous.
A controlled vocabulary may have defined types
of relationships between terms such as in a tax-
onomy (hierarchy), thesaurus (hierarchy, equiva-
lence, association), or ontology (specific types of
relationships like “is produced by”).

Construction of controlled vocabularies is
a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.
Since it requires deep semantic understanding, it
cannot be fully automated. However, we noted
in our experiments that some stages of building
a controlled vocabulary (see Shearer (2004) for a
nine-step procedure to build a thesaurus) can be
partially automated. In particular, we propose to
harvest the information contained in subject in-
dices from earlier or related works.

This paper describes ongoing work along these
lines towards a controlled vocabulary for the Col-
lection of Swiss Law Sources, a large-scale critical
edition of historical texts. The vocabulary is in-
tended to support editors in finding meaningful and
agreed-upon descriptors and to facilitate retrieval
of documents by both experts and laypersons. We
expect that for our purposes a post-coordinate vo-
cabulary2 will be most useful, but the exact type
and structure of the vocabulary will be defined at
a later stage.

The main contributions of this paper are (1) to
raise awareness for existing manually created in-
formation resources, which are potentially valu-
able for many tasks related to the processing of
historical texts, and (2) to describe exploratory
work towards using one type of resource, namely
indices, for creating a controlled vocabulary.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 dis-
cusses related work; Section 3 gives an overview
of the Collection and its subject indices; Section 4
describes the extraction of index terms and their

tion.

conflation using base form reduction; Section 5
describes experiments with decompounding; in
Section 6 we compare the extracted terms with the
headwords of the HRG; Section 7 summarizes our
findings and outlines future work.

2 Related Work

Vocabularies are inherently domain-specific. For
our domain of historical legal texts, there is cur-
rently no controlled vocabulary that could be used
as a basis. Despite some similarities, modern legal
vocabularies such as Jurivoc3 or the GLIN Sub-
ject Term Index4 are not readily applicable to me-
dieval and early modern jurisdictions (e.g., they
lack concepts such as feudal tenure or witchcraft).
The Vocabulaire international de la diplomatique
(Milagros Cárcel Ortí, 1997) is an attempt at a
vocabulary for describing types of historical docu-
ments, but it is not fine-grained enough and does
not consider historical regional differences.

There are various approaches for automatically
generating back-of-the-book indices and thus po-
tential descriptors (e.g., Csomai and Mihalcea
(2008)), but these are intended for book-length
texts in a single language; in the case of historical
editions, however, the documents differ widely in
length, language, and age.

Romanello et al. (2009) have parsed OCR-
processed indices scriptorum and extracted infor-
mation to support the creation of a collection of
fragmentary texts. Even though this is a com-
pletely different task, the approach is somewhat
related to ours, in that it aims to utilize the valuable
information contained in manually created indices.

3 The Collection of Swiss Law Sources

The Collection of Swiss Law Sources is an edition
of historical legal texts created on Swiss territory
from the early Middle Ages up to 1798. The Col-
lection includes acts, decrees, and ordinances, but
also indentures, administrative documents, court
transcripts, and other types of documents. Since
1894, the Law Sources Foundation has edited and
published more than 60,000 pages of source mate-
rial and commentary in over 100 volumes.

The primary users of the Collection are histo-
rians, but it is also an important source for the
Swiss-German Dictionary, which documents the

25



German language in Switzerland from the late Mid-
dle Ages to the 21st century. See Gschwend (2008)
for a more detailed description of the Collection.

The primary sources are manuscripts in various
regional historical forms of German, French, Ital-
ian, Rhaeto-Romanic, and Latin, which are tran-
scribed, annotated, and commented by the editors.
The critical apparatuses are in modern German,
French, or Italian. Each volume contains an index
of persons and places and a subject index. At the
time of this writing, the Collection covers 17 of
the 26 Swiss cantons to different extents.

The Collection is an ongoing project; future
additions to the Collection will be created as digital
editions. Instead of compiling a book, each source
considered for addition to the Collection will be
stored in a TEI-encoded XML document; virtual
volumes, e.g., on a certain topic, place, or period,
can then be created by selecting a subset of these
documents. To make this possible, each document
needs to contain the necessary metadata. Some of
the metadata has traditionally been associated with
each source text: A modern-language summary,
the date, and the place of creation. In addition,
each document will need to be assigned a set of
descriptors.

The basis for the work described in this paper
are the 22 latest volumes of the Collection, for
which digital typesetting data is available; this sub-
set is referred to as DS21 (Höfler and Piotrowski,
2011). We have converted the typesetting files of
the indices into an XML format that makes the logi-
cal structure of the indices explicit, i.e., headwords,
glosses, spelling variants, page and line references,
etc. The conversion process is described in detail
by Piotrowski (2010).

DS21 contains volumes from ten cantons repre-
senting most linguistic and geographic regions of
Switzerland and spans 1078 years. We therefore
believe DS21 to be a good sample of the types
of documents contained in the Collection, and we
therefore expect high-frequency index terms to
be good candidates for inclusion in the controlled
vocabulary. The subject indices of the DS21 vol-
umes contain a total of 70,531 entries (plus 43,264
entries in the indices of persons and places). In
the work described below we have focused on the
German-language volumes; the volumes in French
and Italian will be considered at a later stage. The
subject indices of the German-language volumes
comprise a total of 47,469 entries.

Figure 1 shows an excerpt of a subject index
as it appears in print; Figure 2 shows two of the
entries in the XML format we used as basis for
the experiments described here. Since the subject
indices also serve as glossaries, a particular feature
is that they contain both historical and modern
headwords; words in italics are modern terms, all
other are historical words.

4 Extracting and Conflating Index
Terms

Due to high variability of the historical index terms
we decided to first concentrate on the modern index
terms. Since different historians have worked on
the subject indices, our first question was whether
the extracted terms would overlap at all, and, if
they do, to what extent and in which areas. In to-
tal, 6370 subject index word forms were extracted
using a Perl script from the 16 German-language
volumes. In a first step towards merging the ex-
tracted keywords, we manually removed irrelevant
terms from the list of unique keywords (e.g., histor-
ical terms mistagged as modern terms), resulting in
5138 terms. We normalized the remaining entries
by removing punctuation and grammatical infor-
mation given with some entries. About 85% of

26



the unique terms occur only once. Thus, the vast
majority of terms are associated with a specific
volume.

Of the 15% of keywords that occur more than
once the most frequent one is Erbrecht ‘inheritance
law’ with 10 appearances. Although specific le-
gal terms like Erbrecht are, as would be expected,
relatively frequent, a similar number of keywords
is linked to people’s social, religious, and profes-
sional roles (reflected in terms like vagrant, baptist,
pope, baker, tanner, etc.) together with terminol-
ogy related to trades (for example livestock trade,
animal market, sawmill). This indicates that a con-
trolled vocabulary for the Collection should not
only take into account legal terminology but also
focus on roles and trades, which could potentially
be covered by a separate controlled vocabulary
facet (for a list of potential law subject facets see
also Broughton (2010, p. 38)).

We were surprised by the small intersection be-
tween the volumes’ subject indices. Looking for
ways to further conflate the terms, we noted a num-
ber of mismatches due to morphological variation
(such as singular and plural forms), even though
subject indices are not as inflectionally rich as nor-
mal German text.

Since many index terms are highly domain-
specific or specific to Swiss German (e.g., com-
pounds of the term Anke ‘butter’ like Ankenballen
or Ankenhaus), we did not use a rule-based mor-
phological analyzer (such as GERTWOL, Stripy
Zebra, or Morphisto; for an overview see Mahlow
and Piotrowski (2009)) but the Baseforms tool
from the ASV Toolbox (Biemann et al., 2008),
which is based on pretree classifiers. The Base-
forms tool does not perform morphological analy-
sis, but is more akin to a stemmer, so that its output
is not necessarily linguistically correct; however,
since we are primarily interested in term conflation,
this is not a major problem. When the output of the
system was empty or malformed we used the origi-
nal term to ensure maximum overlap. We manually
reviewed and, where necessary, corrected the base
forms, also to get a better understanding of the
kind of potential conflations. This cut down the
list of keywords from 5138 to 4881 terms, i.e., 490
terms were morphological variants that could be
conflated to 233 “concepts.”

The majority of term conflations concern varia-
tion in number (Kapelle ‘chapel’ and Kapellen
‘chapels’), derivations (Heirat ‘marriage’ and

5 Experiments with Compounds

German is well-known for its tendency to form
compound nouns to express complex concepts. For
vocabulary construction, compounds are interest-
ing because related terms often share constituent
parts. Our idea was therefore to use decompound-
ing to identify potential related terms. The relation-
ships between these terms are usually weaker than
between equivalent terms (like plural and singular
variants), but will still be valuable in building a
controlled vocabulary. For the following experi-
ments we used the decompounding as produced by
the ASV Baseforms tool with manual corrections.

In a first experiment, we extracted groups of
compound-word terms that share the same first
element. This gives us, for example, Bau ‘con-
struction’, Bauarbeiter ‘construction worker’, and
Bauherr ‘constructor’. The terms found in this
way could, for example, be used to build a map on
the topic “construction” as shown in Figure 3. In
total, we found 2555 matches by first compound
elements. Note that partial matching without com-

27



pound splitting would lead to unwanted hits like
Bauer ‘farmer’ and Baumgarten ‘tree garden’.

In a second experiment, we identified terms shar-
ing the same last compound element. Overall this
resulted in 2477 matches. Due to the structure of
German compounds, terms sharing the final com-
pound element are usually more closely related
than those sharing the first element. Examples
along the lines of Bau ‘construction’ are Hausbau
‘house construction’ and Kirchenbau ‘church con-
struction’; see Figure 4. Although not all of the
matches will be equally relevant (for example Erb-
fall ‘case of succession’ and Wasserfall ‘waterfall’
are not semantically related), matches tend to point
to terms on the same hierarchical level, meaning
that the base form consisting of one element only
(if it exists) acts as the broader term (Bau) of the
compound matches which are the narrower terms
(Hausbau and Kirchenbau).

At the moment our approach does not take
into account homonyms and polysemes5 such as
Gericht ‘court’ vs. Gericht ‘dish’ or Kirche ‘church
as a building’ vs. Kirche ‘church as an institution’.
Such semantic unknowns would need to be ana-
lyzed in the context of the text passages that the
back-of-the-book subject indices refer to. Such a
semantic review will be conducted at a later stage
when the terms are prepared to be grouped in a
controlled vocabulary.

6 Comparison to HRG Headwords

As noted in Section 4, the majority of index terms
occur only once, i.e., in a single volume. In or-
der to answer the question of how many of our
terms are just locally useful and how many may
be of more general utility, we compared our list to
the list of headwords of the Handwörterbuch zur
deutschen Rechtsgeschichte (HRG) (Cordes et al.,
2008 ), the standard reference work on German
history of law. The rationale is that the intersec-
tion of both lists contains those index terms that
are highly likely to be useful as descriptors in a
controlled vocabulary.

The comparison of the 3395 headwords taken
from the online version of the HRG6 (excluding
entries for persons) with the 4881 stemmed index

5In the linguistic sense; ANSI/NISO (2005) defines
homonyms and polysemes differently and would refer to
homographs in this context without distinguishing whether
one or more lexemes are involved.

6http://www.hrgdigital.de/

terms of our list yielded an intersection of 447
matches, i.e., 9% of our index terms also appear as
headwords in the HRG.

A closer inspection shows that the rather small
intersection of terms is due to the broader scope of
the Collection of Swiss Law Sources and the fact
that the HRG focuses on German rather than Swiss
history. The former is illustrated by the fact that
the second most frequent term in our list of index
terms after Erbrecht is Bäcker ‘baker’, which does
not appear in the list of HRG keywords. While
professional roles related to legal duties like Notar
‘notary’ or Landvogt ‘bailiff’, as well as religious
roles like Papst ‘pope’ or Kleriker ‘clergyman’ are
also HRG headwords, terminology related to crafts
and trades—like Gerber ‘tanner’ or Schuhmacher
‘shoemaker’—is rare.

However, from a legal perspective, the terms
in the intersection between the Collection and the
HRG are indeed highly relevant. We also noted
that high-frequency index terms from the Collec-
tion are in fact more likely to appear in the list of
HRG headwords than low-frequency terms. As
expected, Erbrecht ‘inheritance law’, the most fre-
quent term in our list of index terms also occurs in
the list of HRG headwords. A third of the terms
appearing three times or more (306 terms) are also
covered by the HRG (102 headwords), in contrast
to an overlap of less than 7% for the terms oc-
curring only once in the indices of the Collection.
The index terms that occur more than once in our
indices (i.e., 18% of our 4881 base form terms) ac-
count for over 46% of the terms in the intersection
with the HRG headwords.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we have described ongoing work
on the extraction of index terms from back-of-
the-book subject indices in order to build a con-
trolled vocabulary for the Collection of Swiss Law
Sources. We have used base form reduction for
term conflation and decompounding for discover-
ing potential hierarchical relations.

We have found that index terms that are also
HRG headwords are likely to be highly relevant;
the terms in the intersection between our index
terms and the HRG headwords will therefore be
reviewed by the editors of the Collection to verify
whether they are a good foundation for a controlled
vocabulary.

At this point, we have only examined index
terms in modern language. However, the majority
(85%) of modern word forms appears only once;
this means that the bulk of the concepts contained
in the indices must be represented by historical-
language index terms. For the construction of a
controlled vocabulary it is thus necessary to also
consider these terms.

While there are only 6370 modern word forms
(5160 unique terms) in the subject indices, we have
extracted 41,099 historical word forms (28,860
unique terms). The reduction of about 30% for
historical versus about 20% for modern terms in-
dicates that historical index terms are more evenly
spread across the analyzed volumes.

The percentage of historical index terms occur-
ring only once is only slightly lower than for mod-
ern terms (80% vs. 85%); however, the historical
terms exhibit a high degree of spelling variation.
We therefore expect that many terms are spelling
variants that can be conflated. We are currently
working on methods for clustering different histor-
ical spellings of related terms.
