Abstract
Native Language Identification, or NLI, is the
task of automatically classifying the L1 of a
writer based solely on his or her essay writ-
ten in another language. This problem area
has seen a spike in interest in recent years
as it can have an impact on educational ap-
plications tailored towards non-native speak-
ers of a language, as well as authorship pro-
filing. While there has been a growing body
of work in NLI, it has been difficult to com-
pare methodologies because of the different
approaches to pre-processing the data, differ-
ent sets of languages identified, and different
splits of the data used. In this shared task, the
first ever for Native Language Identification,
we sought to address the above issues by pro-
viding a large corpus designed specifically for
NLI, in addition to providing an environment
for systems to be directly compared. In this
paper, we report the results of the shared task.
A total of 29 teams from around the world
competed across three different sub-tasks.

1 Introduction

One quickly growing subfield in NLP is the task
of identifying the native language (L1) of a writer
based solely on a sample of their writing in an-
other language. The task is framed as a classifica-
tion problem where the set of L1s is known a priori.
Most work has focused on identifying the native lan-
guage of writers learning English as a second lan-
guage. To date this topic has motivated several pa-
pers and research projects.

Native Language Identification (NLI) can be use-
ful for a number of applications. NLI can be used in

educational settings to provide more targeted feed-
back to language learners about their errors. It
is well known that speakers of different languages
make different kinds of errors when learning a lan-
guage (Swan and Smith, 2001). A writing tutor
system which can detect the native language of the
learner will be able to tailor the feedback about the
error and contrast it with common properties of the
learner’s language. In addition, native language is
often used as a feature that goes into authorship pro-
filing (Estival et al., 2007), which is frequently used
in forensic linguistics.

Despite the growing interest in this field, devel-
opment has been encumbered by two issues. First
is the issue of data. Evaluating an NLI system re-
quires a corpus containing texts in a language other
than the native language of the writer. Because of
a scarcity of such corpora, most work has used the
International Corpus of Learner English (ICLEv2)
(Granger et al., 2009) for training and evaluation
since it contains several hundred essays written by
college-level English language learners. However,
this corpus is quite small for training and testing
statistical systems which makes it difficult to tell
whether the systems that are developed can scale
well to larger data sets or to different domains.

Since the ICLE corpus was not designed with the
task of NLI in mind, the usability of the corpus for
this task is further compromised by idiosyncrasies
in the data such as topic bias (as shown by Brooke
and Hirst (2011)) and the occurrence of characters
which only appear in essays written by speakers of
certain languages (Tetreault et al., 2012). As a result,
it is hard to draw conclusions about which features

48



actually perform best. The second issue is that there
has been little consistency in the field in the use of
cross-validation, the number of L1s, and which L1s
are used. As a result, comparing one approach to
another has been extremely difficult.

The first Shared Task in Native Language Identifi-
cation is intended to better unify this community and
help the field progress. The Shared Task addresses
the two deficiencies above by first using a new cor-
pus (TOEF11, discussed in Section 3) that is larger
than the ICLE and designed specifically for the task
of NLI and second, by providing a common set of
L1s and evaluation standards that everyone will use
for this competition, thus facilitating direct compar-
ison of approaches. In this report we describe the
methods most participants used, the data they eval-
uated their systems on, the three sub-tasks involved,
the results achieved by the different teams, and some
suggestions and ideas about what we can do for the
next iteration of the NLI shared task.

In the following section, we provide a summary
of the prior work in Native Language Identification.
Next, in Section 3 we describe the TOEFL11 cor-
pus used for training, development and testing in this
shared task. Section 4 describes the three sub-tasks
of the NLI Shared Task as well as a review of the
timeline. Section 5 lists the 29 teams that partici-
pated in the shared task, and introduce abbreviations
that will be used throughout this paper. Sections 6
and 7 describe the results of the shared task and a
separate post shared task evaluation where we asked
teams to evaluate their system using cross-validation
on a combination of the training and development
data. In Section 8 we provide a high-level view of
the common features and machine learning methods
teams tended to use. Finally, we offer conclusions
and ideas for future instantiations of the shared task
in Section 9.

2 Related Work

In this section, we provide an overview of some of
the common approaches used for NLI prior to this
shared task. While a comprehensive review is out-
side the scope of this paper, we have compiled a
bibliography of related work in the field. It can be

downloaded from the NLI Shared Task website.1

To date, nearly all approaches have treated the
task of NLI as a supervised classification problem
where statistical models are trained on data from the
different L1s. The work of Koppel et al. (2005) was
the first in the field and they explored a multitude
of features, many of which are employed in several
of the systems in the shared tasks. These features
included character and POS n-grams, content and
function words, as well as spelling and grammati-
cal errors (since language learners have tendencies
to make certain errors based on their L1 (Swan and
Smith, 2001)). An SVM model was trained on these
features extracted from a subsection of the ICLE
corpus consisting of 5 L1s.

N-gram features (word, character and POS) have
figured prominently in prior work. Not only are they
easy to compute, but they can be quite predictive.
However, there are many variations on the features.
Past reseach efforts have explored different n-gram
windows (though most tend to focus on unigrams
and bigrams), different thresholds for how many n-
grams to include as well as whether to encode the
feature as binary (presence or absence of the partic-
ular n-gram) or as a normalized count.

The inclusion of syntactic features has been a fo-
cus in recent work. Wong and Dras (2011) explored
the use of production rules from two parsers and
Swanson and Charniak (2012) explored the use of
Tree Substitution Grammars (TSGs). Tetreault et
al. (2012) also investigated the use of TSGs as well
as dependency features extracted from the Stanford
parser.

Other approaches to NLI have included the use of
Latent Dirichlet Analysis to cluster features (Wong
et al., 2011), adaptor grammars (Wong et al., 2012),
and language models (Tetreault et al., 2012). Ad-
ditionally, there has been research into the effects of
training and testing on different corpora (Brooke and
Hirst, 2011).

Much of the aforementioned work takes the per-
spective of optimizing for the task of Native Lan-
guage Identification, that is, what is the best way of
modeling the problem to get the highest system ac-
curacy? The problem of Native Language Identifica-

tion is also of interest to researchers in Second Lan-
guage Acquisition where they seek to explain syn-
tactic transfer in learner language (Jarvis and Cross-
ley, 2012).

3 Data

The dataset for the task was the new TOEFL11
corpus (Blanchard et al., 2013). TOEFL11 con-
sists of essays written during a high-stakes college-
entrance test, the Test of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage (TOEFL R©). The corpus contains 1,100 es-
says per language sampled as evenly as possible
from 8 prompts (i.e., topics) along with score lev-
els (low/medium/high) for each essay. The 11 na-
tive languages covered by our corpus are: Ara-
bic (ARA), Chinese (CHI), French (FRE), German
(GER), Hindi (HIN), Italian (ITA), Japanese (JAP),
Korean (KOR), Spanish (SPA), Telugu (TEL), and
Turkish (TUR).

The TOEFL11 corpus was designed specifically
to support the task of native language identifica-
tion. Because all of the essays were collected
through ETS’s operational test delivery system for
the TOEFL R© test, the encoding and storage of all
texts in the corpus is consistent. Furthermore, the
sampling of essays was designed to ensure approx-
imately equal representation of native languages
across topics, insofar as this was possible.

For the shared task, the corpus was split into
three sets: training (TOEFL11-TRAIN), development
(TOEFL11-DEV), and test (TOEFL11-TEST). The
train corpus consisted of 900 essays per L1, the de-
velopment set consisted of 100 essays per L1, and
the test set consisted of another 100 essays per L1.
Although the overall TOEFL11 corpus was sampled
as evenly as possible with regard to language and
prompts, the distribution for each language is not ex-
actly the same in the training, development and test
sets (see Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c). In fact, the distri-
bution is much closer between the training and test
sets, as there are several languages for which there
are no essays for a given prompt in the development
set, whereas there are none in the training set, and
only one, Italian, for the test set.

It should be noted that in the first instantiation of
the corpus, presented in Tetreault et al. (2012), we
used TOEFL11 to denote the body of data consisting

of TOEFL11-TRAIN and TOEFL11-DEV. However,
in this shared task, we added 1,100 sentences for a
test set and thus use the term TOEFL11 to now de-
note the corpus consisting of the TRAIN, DEV and
TEST sets. We expect the corpus to be released
through the the Linguistic Data Consortium in 2013.

4 NLI Shared Task Description

The shared task consisted of three sub-tasks. For
each task, the test set was TOEFL11-TEST and only
the type of training data varied from task to task.

• Closed-Training: The first and main task
was the 11-way classification task using only
the TOEFL11-TRAIN and optionally TOEFL11-
DEV for training.

• Open-Training-1: The second task allowed
the use of any amount or type of training data
(as is done by Brooke and Hirst (2011)) exclud-
ing any data from the TOEFL11, but still evalu-
ated on TOEFL11-TEST.

• Open-Training-2: The third task allowed the
use of TOEFL11-TRAIN and TOEFL11-DEV
combined with any other additional data. This
most closely reflects a real-world scenario.

Additionally, each team could submit up to 5 dif-
ferent systems per task. This allowed a team to ex-
periment with different variations of their core sys-
tem.

The training data was released on January 14,
with the development data and evaluation script re-
leased almost one month later on February 12. The
train and dev data contained an index file with the L1
for each essay in those sets. The previously unseen
and unlabeled test data was released on March 11
and teams had 8 days to submit their system predic-
tions. The predictions for each system were encoded
in a CSV file, where each line contained the file ID
of a file in TOEFL11-TEST and the corresponding
L1 prediction made by the system. Each CSV file
was emailed to the NLI organizers and then evalu-
ated against the gold standard.

In total, 29 teams competed in the shared task com-
petition, with 24 teams electing to write papers de-
scribing their system(s). The list of participating

missions. Table 5 shows the results for the third sub-
task “Open-2”. Four teams competed in this task for
a total of 15 submissions.

The challenge for those competing in the Open
tasks was finding enough non-TOEFL11 data for
each L1 to train a classifier. External corpora com-
monly used in the competition included the:

• ICLE: which covered all L1s except for Ara-
bic, Hindi and Telugu;

• FCE: First Certificate in English Corpus
(Yannakoudakis et al., 2011): a collection of
essay written for an English assessment exam,
which covered all L1s except for Arabic, Hindi
and Telugu

• ICNALE: International Corpus Network of
Asian Learners of English (Ishikawa, 2011):
a collection of essays written by Chinese,
Japanese and Korean learners of English along
with 7 other L1s with Asian backgrounds.

• Lang8: http://www.lang8.com: a social net-
working service where users write in the lan-
guage they are learning, and get corrections
from users who are native speakers of that lan-
guage. Shared Task participants such as NAI
and TOR scraped the website for all writng
samples from English language learners. All
of the L1s in the shared task are represented on
the site, though the Asian L1s dominate.

The most challenging L1s to find data for seemed
to be Hindi and Telugu. TUE used essays written
by Pakastani students in the ICNALE corpus to sub-
stitute for Hindi. For Telugu, they scraped mate-
rial from bilingual blogs (English-Telugu) as well
as other material for the web. TOR created cor-
pora for Telugu and Hindi by scraping news articles,
tweets which were geolocated in the Hindi and Tel-
ugu speaking areas, and translations of Hindi and
Telugu blogs using Google Translate.

We caution directly comparing the results of the
Closed sub-task to the Open ones. In the Open-1
sub-task most teams had smaller training sets than
used in the Closed competition which automatically
puts them at a disadvantage, and in some cases there

was a mismatch in the genre of corpora (for exam-
ple, tweets by Telugu speakers are different in com-
position than essays written by Telugu speakers).
TUE and TOR were the only two teams to partic-
ipate in all three sub-tasks, and their Open-2 sys-
tems outperformed their respective best systems in
the Closed and Open-1 sub-tasks. This suggests, un-
surprisingly, that adding more data can benefit NLI,
though quality and genre of data are also important
factors.

7 Cross Validation Results

Upon completion of the competition, we asked the
participants to perform 10-fold cross-validation on a
data set consisting of the union of TOEFL11-TRAIN
and TOEFL11-DEV. This was the same set of data
used in the first work to use any of the TOEFL11
data (Tetreault et al., 2012), and would allow another
point of comparison for future NLI work. For direct
comparison with Tetreault et al. (2012), we provided
the exact folds used in that work.

The results of the 10-fold cross-validation are
shown in Table 6. Two teams had systems that per-
formed at 84.5 or better, which is just slightly higher
than the best team performance on the TOEFL11-
TEST data. In general, systems that performed well
in the main competition also performed similarly
(in terms of performance and ranking) in the cross-
validation experiment. Please note that we report
results as they are reported in the respective papers,
rounding to just one decimal place where possible.

8 Discussion of Approaches

With so many teams competing in the shared task
competition, we investigated whether there were any
commonalities in learning methods or features be-
tween the teams. In this section, we provide a coarse
grained summary of the common machine learning
methods teams employed as well as some of the
common features. Our summary is based on the in-
formation provided in the 24 team reports.

While there are many machine learning algo-
rithms to choose from, the overwhelming majority
of teams used Support Vector Machines. This may
not be surprising given that most prior work has also
used SVMs. Tetreault et al. (2012) showed that one
could achieve even higher performance on the NLI

task using ensemble methods for combining classi-
fiers. Four teams also experimented with different
ways of using ensemble methods. Three teams used
Maximum Entropy methods for their modeling. Fi-
nally, there were a few other teams that tried differ-
ent methods such as Discriminant Function Analysis
and K-Nearest Neighbors. Possibly the most distinct
method employed was that of string kernels by the
BUC team (who placed third in the closed compe-
tition). This method only used character level fea-
tures. A summary of the machine learning methods
is shown in Table 7.

A summary of the common features used across
teams is shown in Table 8. It should be noted that
the table does not detail the nuanced differences in
how the features are realized. For example, in the
case of n-grams, some teams used only the top k
most frequently n-grams while others used all of the
n-grams available. If interested in more information
about the particulars of a system and its feature, we
recommend reading the team’s summary report.

The most common features were word, character
and POS n-gram features. Most teams used n-grams
ranging from unigrams to trigrams, in line with prior
literature. However several teams used higher-order
n-grams. In fact, four of the top five teams (JAR,
OSL, CAR, TUE) generally used at least 4-grams,

and some, such as OSL and JAR, went as high 7 and
9 respectively in terms of character n-grams.

Syntactic features, which were first evaluated in
Wong and Dras (2011) and Swanson and Char-
niak (2012) were used by six teams in the competi-
tion, with most using dependency parses in different
ways. Interestingly, while Wong and Dras (2011)
showed some of the highest performance scores on
the ICLE corpus using parse features, only two of
the six teams which used them placed in the top ten
in the Closed sub-task.

Spelling features were championed by Koppel et
al. (2005) and in subsequent NLI work, however
only three teams in the competition used them.

There were several novel features that teams tried.
For example, several teams tried skip n-grams, as
well as length of words, sentences and documents;
LIM experimented with machine translation; CUN
had different features based on the relative frequen-
cies of the POS and lemma of a word; HAI tried
several new features based on passives and context
function; and the TUE team tried a battery of syn-
tactic features as well as text complexity measures.

9 Summary

We consider the first edition of the shared task a
success as we had 29 teams competing, which we
consider a large number for any shared task. Also
of note is that the task brought together researchers
not only from the Computational Linguistics com-
munity, but also those from other linguistics fields
such as Second Language Acquisition.

We were also delighted to see many teams build
on prior work but also try novel approaches. It is
our hope that finally having an evaluation on a com-
mon data set will allow researchers to learn from

each other on what works well and what does not,
and thus the field can progress more rapidly. The
evaluation scripts are publicly available and we ex-
pect that the data will become available through the
Linguistic Data Consortium in 2013.

For future editions of the NLI shared task, we
think it would be interesting to expand the scope of
NLI from identifying the L1 of student essays to be
able to identify the L1 of any piece of writing. The
ICLE and TOEFL11 corpora are both collections of
academic writing and thus it may be the case that
certain features or methodologies generalize better
to other writing genres and domains. For those in-
terested in robust NLI approaches, please refer to the
TOR team shared task report as well as Brooke and
Hirst (2012).

In addition, since the TOEFL11 data contains pro-
ficiency level one could include an evaluation by
proficiency level as language learners make differ-
ent types of errors and may even have stylistic differ-
ences in their writing as their proficiency progresses.

Finally, while this may be in the periphery of the
scope of an NLI shared task, one interesting evalua-
tion is to see how well human raters can fare on this
task. This would of course involve knowledgeable
language instructors who have years of experience
in teaching students from different L1s. Our think-
ing is that NLI might be one task where computers
would outperform human annotators.
