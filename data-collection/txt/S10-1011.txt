Abstract
This paper presents the description and
evaluation framework of SemEval-2010
Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation
task, as well as the evaluation results of 26
participating systems. In this task, partici-
pants were required to induce the senses of
100 target words using a training set, and
then disambiguate unseen instances of the
same words using the induced senses. Sys-
tems’ answers were evaluated in: (1) an
unsupervised manner by using two clus-
tering evaluation measures, and (2) a su-
pervised manner in a WSD task.

1 Introduction

Word senses are more beneficial than simple word
forms for a variety of tasks including Information
Retrieval, Machine Translation and others (Pantel
and Lin, 2002). However, word senses are usually
represented as a fixed-list of definitions of a manu-
ally constructed lexical database. Several deficien-
cies are caused by this representation, e.g. lexical
databases miss main domain-specific senses (Pan-
tel and Lin, 2002), they often contain general defi-
nitions and suffer from the lack of explicit seman-
tic or contextual links between concepts (Agirre
et al., 2001). More importantly, the definitions of
hand-crafted lexical databases often do not reflect
the exact meaning of a target word in a given con-
text (Véronis, 2004).

Unsupervised Word Sense Induction (WSI)
aims to overcome these limitations of hand-
constructed lexicons by learning the senses of a
target word directly from text without relying on
any hand-crafted resources. The primary aim of
SemEval-2010 WSI task is to allow comparison
of unsupervised word sense induction and disam-
biguation systems.

The target word dataset consists of 100 words,
50 nouns and 50 verbs. For each target word, par-
ticipants were provided with a training set in or-
der to learn the senses of that word. In the next
step, participating systems were asked to disam-
biguate unseen instances of the same words using
their learned senses. The answers of the systems
were then sent to organisers for evaluation.

2 Task description

Figure 1 provides an overview of the task. As
can be observed, the task consisted of three
separate phases. In the first phase, train-
ing phase, participating systems were provided
with a training dataset that consisted of a
set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sen-
tences/paragraphs). Participants were then asked
to use this training dataset to induce the senses
of the target word. No other resources were al-
lowed with the exception of NLP components for
morphology and syntax. In the second phase,
testing phase, participating systems were pro-
vided with a testing dataset that consisted of a
set of target word (noun/verb) instances (sen-
tences/paragraphs). Participants were then asked
to tag (disambiguate) each testing instance with
the senses induced during the training phase. In
the third and final phase, the tagged test instances
were received by the organisers in order to evalu-
ate the answers of the systems in a supervised and
an unsupervised framework. Table 1 shows the to-
tal number of target word instances in the training
and testing set, as well as the average number of
senses in the gold standard.

The main difference of the SemEval-2010 as
compared to the SemEval-2007 sense induction
task is that the training and testing data are treated
separately, i.e the testing data are only used for
sense tagging, while the training data are only used

for sense induction. Treating the testing data as
new unseen instances ensures a realistic evalua-
tion that allows to evaluate the clustering models
of each participating system.

The evaluation framework of SemEval-2010
WSI task considered two types of evaluation.
In the first one, unsupervised evaluation, sys-
tems’ answers were evaluated according to: (1) V-
Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), and
(2) paired F-Score (Artiles et al., 2009). Nei-
ther of these measures were used in the SemEval-
2007 WSI task. Manandhar & Klapaftis (2009)
provide more details on the choice of this evalu-
ation setting and its differences with the previous
evaluation. The second type of evaluation, super-
vised evaluation, follows the supervised evalua-
tion of the SemEval-2007 WSI task (Agirre and
Soroa, 2007). In this evaluation, induced senses
are mapped to gold standard senses using a map-
ping corpus, and systems are then evaluated in a
standard WSD task.

2.1 Training dataset

The target word dataset consisted of 100 words,
i.e. 50 nouns and 50 verbs. The training dataset
for each target noun or verb was created by follow-
ing a web-based semi-automatic method, similar
to the method for the construction of Topic Signa-
tures (Agirre et al., 2001). Specifically, for each
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sense of a target word,
we created a query of the following form:

<Target Word> AND <Relative Set>

The <Target Word> consisted of the target
word stem. The <Relative Set> consisted of a
disjunctive set of word lemmas that were related

Word Query
Sense
Sense 1 failure AND (loss OR nonconformity OR test

OR surrender OR ”force play” OR ...)
Sense 2 failure AND (ruination OR flop OR bust

OR stall OR ruin OR walloping OR ...)

Table 2: Training set creation: example queries for
target word failure

to the target word sense for which the query was
created. The relations considered were WordNet’s
hypernyms, hyponyms, synonyms, meronyms and
holonyms. Each query was manually checked by
one of the organisers to remove ambiguous words.
The following example shows the query created
for the first1 and second2 WordNet sense of the
target noun failure.

The created queries were issued to Yahoo!
search API3 and for each query a maximum of
1000 pages were downloaded. For each page we
extracted fragments of text that occurred in <p>
</p> html tags and contained the target word
stem. In the final stage, each extracted fragment of
text was POS-tagged using the Genia tagger (Tsu-
ruoka and Tsujii, 2005) and was only retained, if
the POS of the target word in the extracted text
matched the POS of the target word in our dataset.

2.2 Testing dataset

The testing dataset consisted of instances of the
same target words from the training dataset. This
dataset is part of OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).
We used the sense-tagged dataset in which sen-
tences containing target word instances are tagged
with OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) senses. The
texts come from various news sources including
CNN, ABC and others.

3 Evaluation framework

For the purposes of this section we provide an ex-
ample (Table 3) in which a target word has 181
instances and 3 GS senses. A system has gener-
ated a clustering solution with 4 clusters covering
all instances. Table 3 shows the number of com-
mon instances between clusters and GS senses.

3.1 Unsupervised evaluation
This section presents the measures of unsuper-
vised evaluation, i.e V-Measure (Rosenberg and
Hirschberg, 2007) and (2) paired F-Score (Artiles
et al., 2009).

3.1.1 V-Measure evaluation
Let w be a target word with N instances (data
points) in the testing dataset. Let K = {Cj |j =
1 . . . n} be a set of automatically generated clus-
ters grouping these instances, and S = {Gi|i =
1 . . . m} the set of gold standard classes contain-
ing the desirable groupings of w instances.

V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007)
assesses the quality of a clustering solution by ex-
plicitly measuring its homogeneity and its com-
pleteness. Homogeneity refers to the degree that
each cluster consists of data points primarily be-
longing to a single GS class, while completeness
refers to the degree that each GS class consists of
data points primarily assigned to a single cluster
(Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). Let h be ho-
mogeneity and c completeness. V-Measure is the
harmonic mean of h and c, i.e. V M = 2·h·ch+c .
Homogeneity. The homogeneity, h, of a clus-
tering solution is defined in Formula 1, where
H(S|K) is the conditional entropy of the class
distribution given the proposed clustering and
H(S) is the class entropy.

h =

{
1, if H(S) = 0
1− H(S|K)H(S) , otherwise

H(S) = −

k=1 akj
(3)

When H(S|K) is 0, the solution is perfectly
homogeneous, because each cluster only contains
data points that belong to a single class. How-
ever in an imperfect situation, H(S|K) depends
on the size of the dataset and the distribution of
class sizes. Hence, instead of taking the raw con-
ditional entropy, V-Measure normalises it by the
maximum reduction in entropy the clustering in-
formation could provide, i.e. H(S). When there
is only a single class (H(S) = 0), any clustering
would produce a perfectly homogeneous solution.
Completeness. Symmetrically to homogeneity,
the completeness, c, of a clustering solution is de-
fined in Formula 4, where H(K|S) is the condi-
tional entropy of the cluster distribution given the
class distribution and H(K) is the clustering en-
tropy. When H(K|S) is 0, the solution is perfectly
complete, because all data points of a class belong
to the same cluster.

For the clustering example in Table 3, homo-
geneity is equal to 0.404, completeness is equal to
0.37 and V-Measure is equal to 0.386.

3.1.2 Paired F-Score evaluation

In this evaluation, the clustering problem is trans-
formed into a classification problem. For each
cluster Ci we generate

(|Ci|
2

)
instance pairs, where

|Ci| is the total number of instances that belong to
cluster Ci. Similarly, for each GS class Gi we gen-
erate

(|Gi|
2

)
instance pairs, where |Gi| is the total

number of instances that belong to GS class Gi.
Let F (K) be the set of instance pairs that ex-

ist in the automatically induced clusters and F (S)
be the set of instance pairs that exist in the gold
standard. Precision can be defined as the number
of common instance pairs between the two sets to
the total number of pairs in the clustering solu-
tion (Equation 7), while recall can be defined as
the number of common instance pairs between the
two sets to the total number of pairs in the gold

65



standard (Equation 8). Finally, precision and re-
call are combined to produce the harmonic mean
(FS = 2·P ·RP+R ).

P =
|F (K) ∩ F (S)|
|F (K)| (7)

R =
|F (K) ∩ F (S)|
|F (S)| (8)

For example in Table 3, we can generate
(
35
2

)
in-

stance pairs for C1 ,
(
70
2

)
for C2,

(
71
2

)
for C3 and(

5
2

)
for C4, resulting in a total of 5505 instance

pairs. In the same vein, we can generate
(
36
2

)
in-

stance pairs for G1,
(
70
2

)
for G2 and

(
75
2

)
for G3. In

total, the GS classes contain 5820 instance pairs.
There are 3435 common instance pairs, hence pre-
cision is equal to 62.39%, recall is equal to 59.09%
and paired F-Score is equal to 60.69%.

3.2 Supervised evaluation
In this evaluation, the testing dataset is split into a
mapping and an evaluation corpus. The first one
is used to map the automatically induced clusters
to GS senses, while the second is used to evaluate
methods in a WSD setting. This evaluation fol-
lows the supervised evaluation of SemEval-2007
WSI task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), with the dif-
ference that the reported results are an average
of 5 random splits. This repeated random sam-
pling was performed to avoid the problems of the
SemEval-2007 WSI challenge, in which different
splits were providing different system rankings.

Let us consider the example in Table 3 and as-
sume that this matrix has been created by using the
mapping corpus. Table 3 shows that C1 is more
likely to be associated with G3, C2 is more likely
to be associated with G2, C3 is more likely to be
associated with G3 and C4 is more likely to be as-
sociated with G1. This information can be utilised
to map the clusters to GS senses.

Particularly, the matrix shown in Table 3 is nor-
malised to produce a matrix M , in which each
entry depicts the estimated conditional probabil-
ity P (Gi|Cj). Given an instance I of tw from
the evaluation corpus, a row cluster vector IC is
created, in which each entry k corresponds to the
score assigned to Ck to be the winning cluster for
instance I . The product of IC and M provides a
row sense vector, IG, in which the highest scor-
ing entry a denotes that Ga is the winning sense.
For example, if we produce the row cluster vector
[C1 = 0.8, C2 = 0.1, C3 = 0.1, C4 = 0.0], and

then we would get a row sense vector in which G3
would be the winning sense with a score equal to
0.43.

4 Evaluation results

In this section, we present the results of the 26
systems along with two baselines. The first base-
line, Most Frequent Sense (MFS), groups all test-
ing instances of a target word into one cluster. The
second baseline, Random, randomly assigns an in-
stance to one out of four clusters. The number
of clusters of Random was chosen to be roughly
equal to the average number of senses in the GS.
This baseline is executed five times and the results
are averaged.

4.1 Unsupervised evaluation
Table 4 shows the V-Measure (VM) performance
of the 26 systems participating in the task. The last
column shows the number of induced clusters of
each system in the test set.The MFS baseline has a
V-Measure equal to 0, since by definition its com-
pleteness is 1 and homogeneity is 0. All systems
outperform this baseline, apart from one, whose
V-Measure is equal to 0. Regarding the Random
baseline, we observe that 17 perform better, which
indicates that they have learned useful information
better than chance.

Table 4 also shows that V-Measure tends to
favour systems producing a higher number of clus-

ters than the number of GS senses, although V-
Measure does not increase monotonically with the
number of clusters increasing. For that reason,
we introduced the second unsupervised evaluation
measure (paired F-Score) that penalises systems
when they produce: (1) a higher number of clus-
ters (low recall) or (2) a lower number of clusters
(low precision), than the GS number of senses.

Table 5 shows the performance of systems us-
ing the second unsupervised evaluation measure.
In this evaluation, we observe that most of the sys-
tems perform better than Random. Despite that,
none of the systems outperform the MFS baseline.
It seems that systems generating a smaller number
of clusters than the GS number of senses are bi-
ased towards the MFS, hence they are not able to
perform better. On the other hand, systems gen-
erating a higher number of clusters are penalised
by this measure. Systems generating a number of
clusters roughly the same as the GS tend to con-
flate the GS senses lot more than the MFS.

4.2 Supervised evaluation results

Table 6 shows the results of this evaluation for a
80-20 test set split, i.e. 80% for mapping and 20%
for evaluation. The last columns shows the aver-
age number of GS senses identified by each sys-
tem in the five splits of the evaluation datasets.
Overall, 14 systems outperform the MFS, while 17
of them perform better than Random. The ranking
of systems in nouns and verbs is different. For in-

stance, the highest ranked system in nouns is UoY,
while in verbs Duluth-Mix-Narrow-Gap. It seems
that depending on the part-of-speech of the target
word, different algorithms, features and parame-
ters’ tuning have different impact.

The supervised evaluation changes the distri-
bution of clusters by mapping each cluster to a
weighted vector of senses. Hence, it can poten-
tially favour systems generating a high number of
homogeneous clusters. For that reason, we applied
a second testing set split, where 60% of the testing
corpus was used for mapping and 40% for eval-
uation. Reducing the size of the mapping corpus
allows us to observe, whether the above statement
is correct, since systems with a high number of
clusters would suffer from unreliable mapping.

Table 7 shows the results of the second super-
vised evaluation. The ranking of participants did
not change significantly, i.e. we observe only dif-
ferent rankings among systems belonging to the
same participant. Despite that, Table 7 also shows
that the reduction of the mapping corpus has a dif-
ferent impact on systems generating a larger num-
ber of clusters than the GS number of senses.

For instance, UoY that generates 11.54 clusters
outperformed the MFS by 3.77% in the 80-20 split
and by 3.71% in the 60-40 split. The reduction of
the mapping corpus had a minimal impact on its
performance. In contrast, KSU KDD that gener-
ates 17.5 clusters was below the MFS by 6.49%

Table 7: Supervised recall (SR) (test set split:60%
mapping, 40% evaluation)

in the 80-20 split and by 7.83% in the 60-40 split.
The reduction of the mapping corpus had a larger
impact in this case. This result indicates that the
performance in this evaluation also depends on the
distribution of instances within the clusters. Sys-
tems generating a skewed distribution, in which a
small number of homogeneous clusters tag the ma-
jority of instances and a larger number of clusters
tag only a few instances, are likely to have a bet-
ter performance than systems that produce a more
uniform distribution.

5 Conclusion

We presented the description, evaluation frame-
work and assessment of systems participating in
the SemEval-2010 sense induction task. The eval-
uation has shown that the current state-of-the-art
lacks unbiased measures that objectively evaluate
clustering.

The results of systems have shown that their
performance in the unsupervised and supervised
evaluation settings depends on cluster granularity
along with the distribution of instances within the
clusters. Our future work will focus on the assess-
ment of sense induction on a task-oriented basis as
well as on clustering evaluation.
