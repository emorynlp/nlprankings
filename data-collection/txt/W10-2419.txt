Abstract 
 

Named Entity Recognition or Extraction 

(NER) is an important task for automated text 

processing for industries and academia 

engaged in the field of language processing, 

intelligence gathering and Bioinformatics.  In 

this paper we discuss the general problem of 

Named Entity Recognition, more specifically 

the challenges in NER in languages that do not 

have language resources e.g. large annotated 

corpora. We specifically address the 

challenges for Urdu NER and differentiate it 

from other South Asian (Indic) languages. We 

discuss the differences between Hindi and 

Urdu and conclude that the NER 

computational models for Hindi cannot be 

applied to Urdu. A rule-based Urdu NER 

algorithm is presented that outperforms the 

models that use statistical learning.  

1. Introduction 
Text processing applications, such as machine 

translation, information extraction, information 

retrieval or natural language understanding 

systems need to recognize multiple word 

expressions that refer to people names, 

organizational names, geographical locations, 

and other named entities. Proper Names play a 

crucial role in information management, both in 

specific applications and in underlying 

technologies that drive the application. Name 

Recognition becomes important in situations 

when the person or the organization is more 

important than the action it performed, for 

example, bankruptcy of the corner shop John & 

Sons is not as interesting as the bankruptcy of 

General Motors, an American car manufacturer. 

In this particular example, latter event will be of 

much interest for the financial markets and 

investors to track.  

The proper name identification depends upon 

the domain, and the applications in that domain. 

For the purpose of this study we have limited the 

scope of names to entities proposed by Palmer 

and Day (1996), i.e. times, numbers, personal 

names, organizations, and geographical areas. 

The goal of a named entity finder is to find these 

entities.  

In this paper we study the challenges of 

named entity recognition for resource scarce 

languages among South Asian languages. Urdu is 

used as an example language because of its large 

number of speakers, the only language in the 

region with Arabic script orthography, and 

interesting assumptions about its similarity with 

Hindi. Section 2 describes the characteristics and 

computational processing for Urdu. Section 3 

motivates the named entity recognition task by 

outlining the challenges in NER in any language 

along with some of the approaches that have 

been used by well known NER systems. Section 

4 discusses some previous work related to NER 

in South Asian languages. Section 5 describes 

challenges of NER in Urdu. Section 6 describes 

the complex relationship between Hindi and 

Urdu and asserts that NER computation models 

for Hindi cannot be used for Urdu NER. Section 

7 presents a rule-based NER algorithm for Urdu 

NER. Section 8 presents the conclusion and 

future work. It is assumed that the reader knows 

the history, orthography and some characteristics 

of Urdu in general. We give a brief introduction 

to Urdu and Urdu processing in section 1.1. For a 

detailed explanation refer to Riaz (2008) that 

describe computational challenges for Urdu 

processing.  

As a convention, Urdu words written in 

Arabic orthography are followed by English 

translation in parenthesis and are italicized.  

2.  Characteristics of Urdu 
This section briefly introduces some right to left 

languages and a few characteristics of Urdu. 

Urdu is the national language of Pakistan, and 

one of the major languages of India. It is 

estimated that there are about 300 million 

speakers of Urdu. Most of the Urdu speakers live 

in Pakistan, India, UAE, U.K and USA. 

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in 

126



 

 

computational processing of right to left 

languages. Most of the interest has been focused 

toward Arabic. There are other right to left 

languages like Urdu, Persian (Farsi), Dari, 

Punjabi, and Pashto that are mostly spoken in 

South Asia. Arabic is a Semitic language and the 

other languages belong to the Proto Indo Iranian 

languages. Arabic and these other languages only 

share script and some vocabulary. Therefore, the 

language specific task done for Arabic is not 

applicable to these languages. For example, 

stemming algorithms generated for Arabic will 

not work for a language like Urdu.  

Unlike other languages in South Asia, Urdu 

shares its grammar with Hindi. The difference is 

vocabulary, and writing style. Hindi is written in 

Devanagri script whereas Urdu is written in 

Arabic script. Because of these similarities, 

Hindi and Urdu are considered one language for 

linguistic purposes but current Hindi resources 

cannot be used for Urdu processing (Riaz, 2009). 

Urdu is quite complex language because Urdu’s 

grammar and morphology is a combination of 

many languages: Sanskrit, Arabic, Farsi, English 

and Turkish to name a few. Urdu’s descriptive 

power is quite high. This means that there could 

be many different ways in which a concept can 

be expressed in Urdu. For example, in Urdu the 

words Pachem and Maghreb both are used for 

the direction West. In the previous example 

Pachem has its ancestry in Sanskrit and Maghreb 

has its roots in Arabic. Urdu is considered the 

lingua franca of business in Pakistan, and the 

South Asian community in the U.K (Baker et. al, 

2003).  

Urdu has a property of accepting lexical 

features and vocabulary from other languages, 

most notably English. This is called code-

switching in linguistics e.g. it is not uncommon 

to see a right to left flow interrupted by a word 

written in English (left to right) and then 

continuation of the flow right to left. For 

example,  That is my laptop). In) ہے laptop وہ ميرا

the above example, Microsoft Word did not 

support English embedding within the Urdu 

sentence and displayed it improperly. But while 

electronically processing, the tokenization will 

be done correctly (Becker and Riaz, 2002). In 

order to process Urdu and other right to left 

languages Unicode encoding and proper font 

usage is necessary. Becker and Riaz (2002) 

discuss Urdu Unicode encoding in detail. 

3. Challenges in NER 
Named Entity Recognition was first introduced 

as part of Message Understanding Conference 

(MUC-6) in 1995 and a related conference MET-

1 in 1996 introduced named entity recognition in 

non-English text. In spite of the recognized 

importance of names in applications, most text 

processing applications such as search systems, 

spelling checkers, and document management 

systems, do not treat proper names correctly. 

This suggests proper names are difficult to 

identify and interpret in unstructured text. 

Generally, names can have innumerable structure 

in and across languages. Names can overlap with 

other names and other words. Simple clues like 

capitalization can be misleading for English and 

mostly not present in non western languages like 

Urdu. 

The goal of NER is first to recognize the 

potential named entities and then resolve the 

ambiguity in the name. There are two types of 

ambiguities in names, structural ambiguity and 

semantic ambiguity. Wacholder et al. (1997) 

describes these ambiguities in detail. Non-

English names pose another dimension of 

problems in NER e.g. the most common first 

name in the world is Muhammad, which can be 

transliterated as Mohmmed, Muhammad, 

Mohammad, Mohamed, Mohd and many other 

variations. These variations make it difficult to 

find the intended named entity. This 

transliteration problem can be solved if the name 

Muhammad is written in Arabic script as محمد.  

3.1 General Approaches to NER 
Over the years many systems have been crafted 

to find names in different domains. Some are 

quite general and work in all domains, while 

others are domain specific. The domain specific 

systems do much better in their domains and 

perform poorly on foreign domains. On the other 

hand the systems that claim generality do not 

work as well as the best domain specific systems 

but do not fare poorly when the domain is 

changed.  

Nymble (Bikel et al, 1996) is a purely 

statistical model where named entities are found 

using a generative statistical model using a 

variant of HMM (Hidden Markov Model). 

Recently, statistical discriminative models like 

Condition Random Fields (CRF) (Wallah, 2002) 

are used consistently for segmenting and labeling 

the sequence data as a graphical model (Lafferty 

et al. 2009). Nominator (Wacholder et al, 1997) 

is a fully implemented module for proper name 

127



 

 

recognition. It applies a set of heuristics to a list 

of words based on patterns of capitalization, 

punctuation and location within the sentence. Dr. 

Hermansen at Linguistic Analysis Systems Inc. 

has a well known system that recognizes names 

based on regional names (Erickson, 2005). 

4. NER for South Asian languages and 

Related Work 
Although over the years there has been 

considerable work done for NER in English and 

other European languages, the interest in the 

South Asian languages has been quite low until 

recently. One of the major reasons for the lack of 

research is the lack of enabling technologies like, 

parts of speech taggers, gazetteers, and most 

importantly, corpora and annotated training and 

test sets. One of the first NER study of South 

Asian languages and specifically on Urdu was 

done by Becker and Riaz (2002) who studied the 

challenges of NER in Urdu text without any 

available resources at the time. The by-product 

of that study was the creation of Becker-Riaz 

Urdu Corpus (2002). Another notable example of 

NER in South Asian language is DARPA’s 

TIDES surprise language challenge where a new 

language is announced by the agency to build 

language processing tools in a short period of 

time. In 2003 the language chosen was Hindi. Li 

and McCallum (2003) tried conditional random 

fields on Hindi data and reported f-measure 

ranging from 56 to 71 with different boosting 

methods. Mukund et al. (2009) used CRF for 

Urdu NER and showed f-measure of 68.9%. 

By far the most comprehensive attempt made 

to study NER for South Asian and South East 

Asian languages was by the NER workshop of 

International Joint Conference of Natural 

Language Processing in 2008. The workshop 

attempted to do Named Entity Recognition in 

Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Oriya, and Urdu. Among 

all these languages Urdu is the only one that has 

Arabic script. Test and training data was 

provided for each language by different 

organizations therefore the quantity of the 

annotated data varied among different languages. 

Hindi and Bengali led the way with the most 

amounts of data; Urdu and Oriya were at the 

bottom with the least amount of data. Urdu had 

about 36,000 thousand tokens available. A 

shared task was defined to find named entities in 

the languages chosen by the researcher. There 

are 15 papers in the final proceedings of NER 

workshop at IJCNLP 2008, all cited in the 

references section, a significant number of those 

papers tried to address all languages in general, 

but resorted to Hindi, where the most number of 

resources were available. Some papers only 

addressed specific languages like Hindi, Bengali, 

Telugu and one paper addressed Tamil. There 

was not a single paper that focused on only Urdu 

named entity recognition. The papers that tried to 

address all languages, the computational model 

showed the lowest performance on Urdu. Among 

the experiments performed at Named Entity 

Workshop on various Indic languages and Urdu, 

almost all experiments used CFR with limited 

success.  

4. NER challenges for Urdu 
In general NER is a difficult task and a number 

of challenges need to be addressed in all 

languages. South Asian languages have some 

additional challenges. We will focus on language 

characteristics and some practical problems of 

language processing focusing on Urdu for 

examples. It is important to note that the 

following characteristics are not unique to Urdu 

nor to the South Asian languages. 

5.1 No Capitalization 

Capitalization, when available, is the most 

important feature for named entity extraction. 

English and many other European languages use 

it to recognize proper names. Orthography of 

Urdu does not support capitalization. English 

systems easily recognize acronyms by using 

capitalization, but in Urdu they are quite difficult 

to recognize. For example,  transcribed)   بی بی سی

BBC) in Urdu cannot be recognized as an 

acronym.  

5.2 Agglutinative nature 

Agglutinative property means that some 

additional features can be added to the word to 

add more complex meaning. Agglutinative 

languages form sentences by adding a suffix to 

the root forms of the word. This feature was 

mentioned in relation to Telugu only in the NER 

literature of IJCNLP 2008 presuming 

unfamiliarity to Urdu by the authors. A deeper 

study shows that agglutinative nature of Urdu 

comes from Persian, Turkish and Dravidian 

languages. In Urdu Hyderabad + i = Hyderabadi 

یحيدرآببد ; the root word is Hyderabad and the 

suffix is i. Here Hyderabadi should not be 

recognized as a named entity whereas 

Hyderabad (city in India) should be recognized 

as a location named entity.  

128



 

 

5.3 Ambiguity  

Ambiguity in proper name names is present in 

South Asian languages as in English. The names 

like Brown are ambiguous in English – name or 

color. Similarly,  سحر (Sahar) is ambiguous in 

Urdu – name or morning dawn. In Urdu this gets 

more complicated because سحر    (Sahar)  also 
means a spell.  

Common nouns can be used as proper names 

in South Asian languages. An example in Urdu 

is کریم (generosity) which is also a man’s name.  

5.4 Word Order 

A number of South Asian languages have a 

different word-order than English and some have 

a free word-order. Urdu mostly has a word order 

but depending upon the domain the word order is 

not respected. e.g. Jamal ne paani ka pura glass 

piya  and Panni ka glass Jamal ne pura piya both 

translates to Jamal drank a whole glass of water.  

5.5 Spelling Variations 

A number of situations occur in news articles 

where different authors or reporters scribe the 

name in different spellings even for native Urdu 

names. In English, this is recognized by 

capitalization and but in Urdu in the absence of 

capitalization this becomes a problem. An 

example is د مسعو  and  where both strings , مسود

represent the same person Masood.  مسعود 

(Masood) represents the Arabic style of writing 

the name with an extra vowel and مسود (Masood) 

is written in the native Urdu form.  

5.6 Ambiguity in Suffixes 

A very common phenomenon in the proper 

names and common name in the South Asian 

languages is the use of a location suffix in a 

name. Sometimes the suffix is attached to the 

location name like a building or a road. A 

common practice is to append the location of 

person’s origin in a name with a suffix -i or -vi. 

For example, if a person was from Batala (city in 

the Indian Punjab), -vi is added to the name to 

form Batalvi. This is observed in Urdu because 

most poets of Urdu use a name of their choosing, 

like an alias, at the end their name. This alias is 

called takhalus to refer themselves in their 

poetry. Almost always these names in absence of 

the poetic context are meaningful words that are 

not named entities. 

5.7 Loan words in Urdu 

Urdu has a number of loan words. Loan words 

are words that are not indigenous to Urdu. The 

named entity recognizer that is based on simple 

morphological cues will fail to recognize a large 

number of proper nouns. For example, وتبوبموبےگوا 

(Guantanamo Bay) is an English word with Bay 

as a cue for location. Similarly, for Osama Bin 

Laden, به (bin) an Arabic cue needs to be used in 

the middle of the name for the person name.  

5.8 Nested Entities 

The named entities that are classified as nested 

contain two proper names that are nested 

together to form a new named entity. An 

example in Urdu is Punjab University where 

Punjab is the location name and University 

marks the whole entity as an organization.  

5.9 Conjunction Ambiguity 

Urdu text shows quite a few examples of 

conjunction ambiguities among proper nouns. 

That is, there is an ambiguity if the entity is one 

proper noun or two proper nouns e.g. Toyota and 

Honda motor company in English. Although, this 

phenomenon is present in most languages none 

of the papers in IJCNLP NER workshop 

mentioned them as a problem. An example of 

conjunction ambiguity is   دیبوے کھبوب  یبھواور  گوگل

(Google and Yahoo offered banquet).  

5.10 Resource Challenges 

NER approaches are either based on rule engine 

or inference engines. In each approach some type 

of corpus is required; lack of a large corpus for 

deriving rules is an issue for most South Asian 

languages, Urdu in particular. There are only two 

corpora available EMILLE corpus (Baker, et al., 

2003) and Becker-Riaz (2002) corpus. The 

EMILLE corpus contains long running articles 

that do not have a lot of named entities. Becker-

Riaz corpus contains short news articles and has 

a very rich content for named entity recognition. 

NER workshop at IJCNLP 2008 did not use 

either of them and contained only 36,000 Urdu 

tokens. 

Recent experiments in NER in almost all 

aspects have been conducted through the use of 

inference engines using statistical machine 

learning. In the NER workshop at IJCNLP 2008, 

with one exception, all experiments used 

statistical machine learning for name recognition 

and conditional random fields (CRF) was 

favored by the majority. A good large annotated 

corpus is the pre-requisite to learn the rules. All 

experiments that used pure machine learning 

performed poorly and had to boost the 

performance of the system using gazetteers, 

online dictionaries and other hand crafted rules. 

129



 

 

Urdu NER performed poorly and mostly at the 

bottom for each experiment and all researchers 

claimed the lack of the other resources to boost 

its performance. In summary, there is a dearth of 

annotated corpus for named entities for NER for 

South Asian languages. Urdu and Oriya are two 

languages where researchers could not find any 

gazetteers and online dictionaries for boosting 

the performance of the algorithms. 

6. Analysis of Urdu and Hindi 
Since Hindi NER was satisfactory in NER 

workshop at IJCNLP 2008 and Urdu and Hindi 

are closely related languages, a claim can be 

made that any computational model or algorithm 

that works for Hindi should work for Urdu also. 

This section describes in detail that this assertion 

is invalid for computational processing and 

sharing of resources. Extensive research has been 

done about the ancestry of Urdu and Hindi and 

their origins but no research study exists that 

compares and contrasts Urdu and Hindi in a 

scholarly fashion (Russell, 1996). Some 

rudimentary experiments for computationally 

recognizing names show that Hindi and Urdu 

behaved as two different languages. For 

example, while trying to recognize the capitol,   

the cues of recognition of locations are different 

e.g. Dar-al-Khilafah (Urdu) and Rajdihani 

(Hindi) are both used for the capitol of a city or a 

country. Therefore, we concluded that more 

research is warranted to understand the 

relationship between these two languages to 

understand if the computational models based 

one language can be used in some capacity for 

the other language.  

The relationship between Hindi and Urdu is 

very complex, while analyzing the differences at 

high level they can be treated as the same 

language and play pivotal role in establishing the 

links between other South Asian communities 

across the world. At detailed levels they are 

separate languages and deserve to be studied and 

treated as separate languages. This is most 

apparent in the official documents produced by 

the Indian government in Hindi and news 

broadcasts that are not understandable by Urdu 

speakers (Matthews, 2002). The following 

example is borrowed from Russell (1996) to 

explain the growing divergence between Hindi 

and Urdu. Consider the sentence in English “The 

eighteenth century was the period of the social, 

economic and political decline”. The Urdu 

translation of the sentence is “Atharvin sadi 

samaji, iqtisadi aur siyasi zaval ka daur tha” 

while the Hindi equivalent is “Atharvin sadi 

samajik, arthik aur rajnitik girav ki sadi thi”. 

Russell points out that this example shows alone 

that Urdu speakers cannot understand the 

meaning of the Hindi equivalent and vice versa. 

Therefore, these two languages should not be 

treated as the same language in all 

circumstances. 
We assert that that computational models 

built for one of the languages cannot be 

translated for the other language. A case in point 
is Hindi Wordnet (Jha et al., 2001), which is an 

excellent source for Hindi language processing 

but cannot be used for Urdu, because of the 

explanations given earlier. In addition, the 

following properties of the Hindi Wordnet make 

it unusable for Urdu processing without extra 

ordinary amount of work: The terminology used 

to describe parts of speech (POS) in Hindi 

Wordnet is completely foreign to Urdu speaker. 

Also, the POS names are Sanskrit-based whereas 

the Urdu POS are Persian and Arabic based. For 

example, in Hindi the word for noun is sangya 

and in Urdu it is called ism. The proper noun in 

Hindi is called vyakti vachak sangy, no Urdu 

speaker will know this unless they have studied 

Hindi grammar. In order to work through these 

differences, one has to be familiar with both 

languages at almost expert levels. In other words 

in order to use Hindi resources to do Urdu 

computational processing one has to know Hindi 

at detailed linguistic level.  A detailed analysis of 

phonological differences between Hind and Urdu 

and the resource construction of Hindi using 

Highbrow formalisms is discussed in detail by 

Riaz (2009).  

7. Rule-based Urdu NER 
We used a hand crafted rule-based NER system 

for Urdu NER instead of using a machine 

learning approach for the following reasons:  

 There are no good annotated corpora available. 
The only annotated corpus available is through 

the NER workshop of IJCNLP 2008 which is 

only 36000 words.  

 At NER workshop IJCNLP 2008 Urdu data 
was available to all the researchers but none of 

the experiment fared well for Urdu using CRF. 

 Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is the state 
of art for named entity extraction, in the 

absence of boosting methods like gazetteers, 

CRF performed poorly with only annotated 

text.  

130



 

 

 There are no gazetteers and online dictionaries 
available for Urdu that are accessible through 

Web Services or for online consumption.  

 Hindi resources cannot be used to bridge the 
lack of language resources for Urdu (Riaz, 

2009). 

 Creating a new set of tagged data set for 
modeling CRF or other new statistical 

algorithm on Urdu data is cost prohibitive at 

this time.  

7.1 Experiment Setup 

There are two corpora available for Urdu for 

research in NER; Becker-Riaz corpus and 

EMILLE corpus. Although EMILLE is a larger 

corpus, it contains articles that are long and 

deficient of named entities. Becker-Riaz corpus 

is a news article corpus and it contains abundant 

of named entities. We chose 2,262 documents 

from the Becker-Riaz corpus and removed a 

number of XML tags and their content for 

readability. A sample document from the reduced 

Becker-Riaz corpus is constructed by using 

XSLT is given below: 
 <cesDoc> 
<doc-number>021003_uschinairaq_atif</doc-number> 

<title> قبول کو روس قرارداد یوئ:عراق ںیوہ   </title> 

<para> وانیا یکیامر   

 یاسیس یک یسیپبل یک بش صدر متعلق سے عراق کو بدھ وے ومبئىدگبن

 خالف کے بغداد لئے کے کہیامر بظبہر ببعث کے جس ہے یک تیحمب

قوت یعسکر   

 اس اة وٹیس یکیامر تبہم۔ یگ جبئے ہو ہموار راہ یک کروے استعمبل

غور پر معبملے  اة وٹیس یکیامر تبہم۔ یگ جبئے ہو ہموار راہ یک کروے 

  معبملے اس

۔یگ کرے             </para> 

</cesDoc> 

The documents are not tagged with named 

entities so rules need to be constructed to find 

proper names. A number of proper noun cues are 

available in the text to generate those rules. 

About 200 documents were analyzed to construct 

the set of rules, while analyzing text a number of 

ambiguities were found – some of those are 

discussed in the earlier sections. The rules were 

constructed for the following named entities – 

examples are given in English for clarity.  

 Person name e.g. George Bush 

 Person of influence if proper name is identified 
e.g. President George Bush 

 Location name e.g. Pakistan, Bharat, Punjab, 
America, Lahore 

 Date: 1996 

 Numbers: e.g. 31,000 

 Organization e.g. Taliban, Al-Qaeda, B.B.C. 
Although rules are designed to recognize the 

above named entities, the current implementation 

recognizes all of them as simple named-entities. 

While crafting rules for named entities a number 

of interesting rule patterns, heuristics and 

challenges were discovered that play important 

role when discovering a named entity. We 

mention some interesting ones below:  

 Punctuation marks like “:” are useful but the 
position of their occurrence in text is 

important. 

 Beginning of the sentence in title of news text 
has a different rule than beginning of the 

sentence in the paragraph text. 

 Titles of the news text are not grammatically 
formed. A rudimentary POS tagger available 

from CRULP (Center for Research in Urdu 

language Processing) fails on marking the 

constituents of sentence. Moreover, POS 

tagger changed the order of words. This further 

complicated writing matching rules. 

 Stemming reduces the precision of the system. 
It will conflate terms like Pakistani to 

Pakistan. Hence, marking Pakistan as named 

entity in the context of the Pakistani which is 

not a named entity. 

 Suffix rules are very helpful in recognition of 
location names e.g. –stan for Pakistan, 

Afghanistan etc. But it does not find names 

like Bharat, Iran etc.  

 Same suffix can identify location and 
organization e.g. Taliban and Afghanistan. 

 String of names like Rahid Latif, Shahid Afridi, 
and Muhammad Yousaf are problematic for our 

NER system since there is no capitalization in 

Urdu and they occur without any prefix or 

suffix cues. 

 Co-reference resolution for names will be non-
trivial since they have multiple spellings, only 

context can be used to resolve them. For 

example, Milosevic is spelled at least with 

three different spellings.  

 Honorific titles are very important but a title 

like Sadr (President) can occasionally lead to 

incorrect recognition because Sadr is the 

location of a well known neighborhood of 

Karachi (largest city in Pakistan).  

 Honorific titles are sometimes transliterated 
into Urdu from English and other times they 

are scribed in indigenous from in another 

article to refer to the same person e.g. کيپٹه is 

the transliteration of captain and  meansکپتبن 

captain in indigenous Urdu form.  

 Anchoring around the named entities is a 

useful heuristic. The anchor text choice is one 

of the most challenging tasks for our system.  

131



 

 

7.2 Algorithm for Urdu NER 

In our rule-based system, the rules form a finite 

state automata (FSA) based on lexical cues. 

Some cues are at the start of the state, some are 

at the end of the state, sometimes the cues are 

found in the middle of the finite state machine. 

These rules are corpus-based, heuristic-based, 

and grammar-based. The rules are implicitly 

weighted in the order they are applied. For 

example, the most probable match is listed first 

and applied first on the text string. For example, 

one rule that has high chance of recognizing the 

person name is راہىمب ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔ وے. Here  راہىمب and وے  

are anchors. In English this rule will be 

represented as Rahnuma [𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛1 , 𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛2] post-
position (Rahnuma means leader in Urdu). In the 

example given 𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛1 , 𝑡𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛2 will be tagged as 
a named entity. Each rule is represented as 

regular expressions since they are an ideal way to 

represent rules created as finite state automata. 

Instead of finding the named entities in each 

document in this version of the system the 

algorithm finds named entities in the given string 

of text regardless of the document. The input to 

the algorithm is a UTF-8 or UTF-16 Urdu text 

string. One document contains two input strings, 

the title of the document and the paragraph 

represented as long string without line breaks. 

There could be a number of named entities in the 

paragraph but our rules currently address on 

named-entity recognition per rule. An n-gram 

approach was used to limit the length of the input 

text. After a number of experiments, a 6-gram 

model was used for an input string. The bigram 

model was too small and trigram models showed 

it had no room for named-entities for multi word 

named entities, four gram and five gram models 

lacked adequate room for anchor texts and cues. 

6-gram model was quite successful but 

sometimes the windows size was too big when a 

tri-gram would have worked e.g. two anchor 

tokens and a named-entity representing one 

token. The n-grams were constructed by using 

JDOM implementation to read in XML 

documents.  

When a named entity is found with full 

confidence it is propagated to all 6-grams and if 

the matched named entity is found in other input 

strings (6-grams) it is tagged as a named-entity. 

Once the 6-gram is tagged it is not processed 

again. There are some named entities that are 

abundant in the text but sometimes their 

occurrences are ambiguous in a number of ways. 

The reason for these ambiguities is because these 

entities are so prevalent in the news articles and 

common in the South Asia that reporters and 

writers of news articles do not use cues to refer 

them in the news text. For example, cities like 

Karachi, Lahore, and countries like America, 

Bharat, Pakistan occur frequently with no cues. 

Instead of writing complicated regular 

expressions, a small authority file is created with 

these important names. This authority file serves 

like a mini gazetteer for our system. A lookup is 

done before the rules are applied if the name is 

found the entity is marked. Currently, the 

authority file contains 40 named entities after 

examining the 200 document rule-creation set. In 

the absence of the authority file, complicated 

rules will need to be crafted using morphological 

analysis for words like Pakistan and through 

some co-reference resolution for words like 

Karachi.  

The complete algorithm is given below:  
 Iterate over the input 6-grams 

a. Given the input text match the 

string’s tokens with the tokens in 

the authority file. 

b. If the match occurs mark the 

named entity and iterate all 

other input strings and mark them 

with the matched entity if it is 

present.  

i. The strings that are tagged are 

removed from the pool to be 

matched 

c. If the match does not occur in 

the authority file iterate over 

the regular expressions to match 

the expression on the input 

string. 

i.  If the match occurs on a 

regular expression, mark the 

name entity and iterate over 

all other input strings and 

mark them with the matched 

entity if it is present. 

It is important to note that the algorithm 

presented above recognizes name entities in the 

exponential complexity for clarity but the actual 

implementation is done in linear time 

complexity.  

In the algorithm, regular expressions that are 

the bottom of the list will be applied when the 

input string was not tagged with any previous 

regular expression and the input string did not 

have any token that is the authority file. The 

regular expressions that are towards the bottom 

of the list tend to have patterns that are mostly 

recognized by the readers who have background 

knowledge about the topic discussed in the 

document e.g. the string of names of cricket 

players without any reference to the cricket or 

132



 

 

athlete. English translation of the text would be 

Rashid Latif and Shahid Afridi are in the field. 

These names of Pakistani cricketers will be 

known to most South Asians who have followed 

cricket at any level.  

Given an input 6-gram, there could be more 

than one entity in the input string but we are only 

finding one named entity and then not processing 

the string again. This might give the impression 

that other named entities will not be tagged. Our 

set up of n-grams prevents us from the missing 

the later named entity in the string because these 

entities will show up as one of subsequent 6-

grams.  

The rules at the top of the list could tie for 

importance e.g. The rules for جىرل فيصل (General 

Faisal) and فيصل  اہشبھر   (Shahrah-e-Faisal or 

Faisal Boulevard) have very consistent previous 

token cues. Our strategy of looping through all 

the 6-grams to tag the named entities is going to 

tag both strings as named entities but it will not 

classify شبھراہ   فيصل as the location if the 

“general” rule was applied first. This has the 

side-effect of low recall for nested-entities.  

7.3 Evaluation & Results 
The rule sets were created from 200 documents 

of Becker-Riaz corpus and the experiment were 

run on 2,262 documents. Each of these 

documents is evaluated to create relevance 

judgments. The relevance judgments are created 

by two native speakers of Urdu who are avid 

news readers. The results of experiment runs 

were hard to grade on such a large set of 

documents so we chose 600 documents for 

evaluation. Two judges were chosen who are 

fluent in Urdu but required some coaching to 

recognize the named entities. At first judges were 

expecting terms like Palestinian and elections to 

be named entities but after some coaching all 

evaluation was done correctly. There were very 

few disagreements among the judges after 

coaching. A third native speaker was used to 

address instances of disagreements between the 

two initial judges. The evaluation set was chosen 

where all the judges agreed upon the named 

entities. The results are measured by 𝑓 −
𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 that is defined in terms of well known 
Information Retrieval measures of precision 

𝑃and recall𝑅. 𝑓 − 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 is defined by the 

following equation: 𝑓 −𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 =
2𝑃𝑅

𝑃+𝑅
 

Since our algorithm does not support named 

entity recognition at a document level, the total 

number of unique named entities in the 

evaluation set are found. The total numbers of 

unique named entities are 206. The algorithm 

matched about 2819 total named entities. While 

creating the rules and the evaluation set it looked 

as the number of documents grows the unique 

named-entities will level out gradually, but we 

found a lot of repetitions as the number of 

documents increased but new names consistently 

were added to the unique list but at a very low 

rate. Although, the corpus domain is news text, 

the genre of the documents spans over almost 

any news worthy information in South Asia, this 

results in increase of non-unique names. The 

algorithm execution resulted in 187 named-

entities and 171 of those were true named 

entities. The results show the recall of 90.7% and 

precision of 91.5%. This gives the 𝑓1 −
𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 value of 91.1%. We found that, 
suffixes cues and anchor text features were very 

useful feature but at the same time anchor text 

feature was the cause of most false positives. 

Almost all false positives were noun phrases. We 

ran our rule set on the 36,000 token Urdu data 

provided for IJCNLP 2008 NER Workshop. 

Without tuning any of the rules 𝑓1 −𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 
was 72.4% and after adding a few rules after 

looking at the training set 𝑓1 −𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 was 
increased to 81.6% on the test set. A close 

analysis of this data showed considerable lack of 

named entities in contrast to the Becker-Riaz 

corpus. Therefore major results are drawn from 

the Becker-Riaz corpus. The results of rule 

execution on IJCNLP 2008 data for Urdu are 

better than any of the results reported in IJCNLP 

2008 NER workshop for Urdu data. 

7.3.1 Discussion 
Although our results are very encouraging some 

discussion is warranted about the experience in 

creating and refining the rules for named entity 

recognition.  

 The 6-gram is processed a number of times to 
see the performance with stemming and noise 

words. Both stemming and removal of stop 

words lowers the precision of the system. 

 We mostly used Urdu postpositions as suffix 
anchor texts. This rule sometimes gave a high 

recall but very low precision e.g. the 

postposition conflicted with the transcribed 

English words in Urdu. 

 We removed a rule where the entity is 
preceded by the punctuation mark colon in the 

title filed. This rule gave 100% recall but the 

precision was about 30%.  

133



 

 

 Some of the cue words gave 100% recall but 
the precision was quite low e.g. the rule that 

identifies name entity through the cue word of 

transcribed English word of leader gave perfect 

recall but 56% precision.  

 The phrases that could contain more than one 
token are sometimes written with the blank 

space between tokens and sometimes as one 

token e.g.  وزیراعظم (prime minister). In this 

case the rules are modified to recognize both 

occurrences.  

8. Conclusion and Future work.  
NER in Urdu is a challenging problem for 

language processing. In the absence of a learning 

training set, rule-based approach for NER in 

Urdu shows promising results. Also, we argue 

that Hindi resources like gazetteers etc. cannot be 

used Urdu NER models. Our results are an 

improvement on all other approaches that are 

used for Urdu NER. It also shows that our rule-

based approach is superior to Conditional 

Random Fields approach used in IJCNLP 2008 

NER workshop by the majority of the papers. In 

future we plan to use online dictionaries from 

CRULP through Web Services framework, if 

available instead of the manually created 

authority file. Finally, we want to change our 

regular expressions to accommodate already 

named entity tagged texts and also to identify 

names at document level.
