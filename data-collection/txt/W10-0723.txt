Abstract
This paper considers the linguistic indicators of bias
in political text. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk
judgments about sentences from American political
blogs, asking annotators to indicate whether a sen-
tence showed bias, and if so, in which political di-
rection and through which word tokens. We also
asked annotators questions about their own political
views. We conducted a preliminary analysis of the
data, exploring how different groups perceive bias in
different blogs, and showing some lexical indicators
strongly associated with perceived bias.

1 Introduction
Bias and framing are central topics in the study of com-
munications, media, and political discourse (Scheufele,
1999; Entman, 2007), but they have received relatively
little attention in computational linguistics. What are the
linguistic indicators of bias? Are there lexical, syntactic,
topical, or other clues that can be computationally mod-
eled and automatically detected?

Here we use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to en-
gage in a systematic, empirical study of linguistic indi-
cators of bias in the political domain, using text drawn
from political blogs. Using the MTurk framework, we
collected judgments connected with the two dominant
schools of thought in American politics, as exhibited in
single sentences. Since no one person can claim to be an
unbiased judge of political bias in language, MTurk is an
attractive framework that lets us measure perception of
bias across a population.

2 Annotation Task
We drew sentences from a corpus of American political
blog posts from 2008. (Details in Section 2.1.) Sentences
were presented to participants one at a time, without con-
text. Participants were asked to judge the following (see
Figure 1 for interface design):

• To what extent a sentence or clause is biased (none,
somewhat, very);

• The nature of the bias (very liberal, moderately lib-
eral, moderately conservative, very conservative, bi-
ased but not sure which direction); and

• Which words in the sentence give away the author’s
bias, similar to “rationale” annotations in Zaidan et
al. (2007).

For example, a participant might identify a moderate
liberal bias in this sentence,

Without Sestak’s challenge, we would have
Specter, comfortably ensconced as a Democrat
in name only.

adding checkmarks on the underlined words. A more
neutral paraphrase is:

Without Sestak’s challenge, Specter would
have no incentive to side more frequently with
Democrats.

It is worth noting that “bias,” in the sense we are us-
ing it here, is distinct from “subjectivity” as that topic
has been studied in computational linguistics. Wiebe
et al. (1999) characterize subjective sentences as those
that “are used to communicate the speaker’s evaluations,
opinions, and speculations,” as distinguished from sen-
tences whose primary intention is “to objectively com-
municate material that is factual to the reporter.” In con-
trast, a biased sentence reflects a “tendency or preference
towards a particular perspective, ideology or result.”1 A
subjective sentence can be unbiased (I think that movie
was terrible), and a biased sentence can purport to com-
municate factually (Nationalizing our health care system

is a point of no return for government interference in the

lives of its citizens
2).

In addition to annotating sentences, each participant
was asked to complete a brief questionnaire about his or
her own political views. The survey asked:

1. Whether the participant is a resident of the United
States;

2. Who the participant voted for in the 2008 U.S.
presidential election (Barack Obama, John McCain,
other, decline to answer);

3. Which side of political spectrum he/she identified
with for social issues (liberal, conservative, decline
to answer); and

4. Which side of political spectrum he/she identified
with for fiscal/economic issues (liberal, conserva-
tive, decline to answer).

This information was gathered to allow us to measure
variation in bias perception as it relates to the stance of
the annotator, e.g., whether people who view themselves
as liberal perceive more bias in conservative sources, and
vice versa.

2.1 Dataset
We extracted our sentences from the collection of blog
posts in Eisenstein and Xing (2010). The corpus con-
sists of 2008 blog posts gathered from six sites focused
on American politics:

• American Thinker (conservative),3

• Digby (liberal),4

• Hot Air (conservative),5

• Michelle Malkin (conservative),6

• Think Progress (liberal),7 and

• Talking Points Memo (liberal).8

13,246 posts were gathered in total, and 261,073 sen-
tences were extracted using WebHarvest9 and OpenNLP
1.3.0.10 Conservative and liberal sites are evenly rep-
resented (130,980 sentences from conservative sites,
130,093 from liberal sites). OpenNLP was also used for
tokenization.

2.2 Sentence Selection
To support exploratory data analysis, we sought a di-
verse sample of sentences for annotation, but we were
also guided by some factors known or likely to correlate
with bias. We extracted sentences from our corpus that
matched at least one of the categories below, filtering to
keep those of length between 8 and 40 tokens. Then, for
each category, we first sampled 100 sentences without re-
placement. We then randomly extracted sentences up to
1,100 from the remaining pool. We selected the sentences
this way so that the collection has variety, while including
enough examples for individual categories. Our goal was
to gather at least 1,000 annotated sentences; ultimately
we collected 1,041. The categories are as follows.

“Sticky” partisan bigrams. One likely indicator of
bias is the use of terms that are particular to one side or
the other in a debate (Monroe et al., 2008). In order to
identify such terms, we independently created two lists
of “sticky” (i.e., strongly associated) bigrams in liberal
and conservative subcorpora, measuring association us-
ing the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) and omitting
bigrams containing stopwords.11 We identified a bigram
as “liberal” if it was among the top 1,000 bigrams from
the liberal blogs, as measured by strength of association,
and was also not among the top 1,000 bigrams on the con-
servative side. The reverse definition yielded the “conser-
vative” bigrams. The resulting liberal list contained 495
bigrams, and the conservative list contained 539. We then
manually filtered cases that were clearly remnant HTML
tags and other markup, arriving at lists of 433 and 535,
respectively. Table 1 shows the strongest weighted bi-
grams.

As an example, consider this sentence (with a preced-
ing sentence of context), which contains gi bill. There is
no reason to think the bigram itself is inherently biased
(in contrast to, for example, death tax, which we would

and Pedersen, 2003).

perceive as biased in virtually any unquoted context), but
we do perceive bias in the full sentence.

Their hard fiscal line softens in the face of
American imperialist adventures. According to
CongressDaily the Bush dogs are also whining
because one of their members, Stephanie Her-
seth Sandlin, didn’t get HER GI Bill to the floor
in favor of Jim Webb’s .

Emotional lexical categories. Emotional words might
be another indicator of bias. We extracted four categories
of words from Pennebaker’s LIWC dictionary: Nega-
tive Emotion, Positive Emotion, Causation, and Anger.12
The following is one example of a biased sentence in our
dataset that matched these lexicons, in this case the Anger
category; the match is in bold.

A bunch of ugly facts are nailing the biggest
scare story in history.

The five most frequent matches in the corpus for each
category are as follows.13

Negative Emotion: war attack* problem* numb* argu*

Positive Emotion: like well good party* secur*

Causation: how because lead* make why

Anger: war attack* argu* fight* threat*

Kill verbs. Greene and Resnik (2009) discuss the rel-
evance of syntactic structure to the perception of senti-
ment. For example, their psycholinguistic experiments
would predict that when comparing Millions of people
starved under Stalin (inchoative) with Stalin starved mil-
lions of people (transitive), the latter will be perceived as
more negative toward Stalin, because the transitive syn-
tactic frame tends to be connected with semantic prop-
erties such as intended action by the subject and change
of state in the object. “Kill verbs” provide particularly
strong examples of such phenomena, because they ex-
hibit a large set of semantic properties canonically as-
sociated with the transitive frame (Dowty, 1991). The
study by Greene and Resnik used 11 verbs of killing and
similar action to study the effect of syntactic “packag-
ing” on perceptions of sentiment.14 We included mem-
bership on this list (in any morphological form) as a se-
lection criterion, both because these verbs may be likely

12http://www.liwc.net. See Pennebaker et al. (2007) for de-
tailed description of background theory, and how these lexicons were
constructed. Our gratitude to Jamie Pennebaker for the use of this dic-
tionary.

13Note that some LIWC lexical entries are specified as pre-
fixes/stems, e.g. ugl*, which matches ugly uglier, etc.

14The verbs are: kill, slaughter, assassinate, shoot, poison, strangle,
smother, choke, drown, suffocate, and starve.

to appear in sentences containing bias (they overlap sig-
nificantly with Pennebaker’s Negative Emotion list), and
because annotation of bias will provide further data rel-
evant to Greene and Resnik’s hypothesis about the con-
nections among semantic propeties, syntactic structures,
and positive or negative perceptions (which are strongly
connected with bias).

In our final 1,041-sentence sample, “sticky bigrams”
occur 235 times (liberal 113, conservative 122), the lexi-
cal category features occur 1,619 times (Positive Emotion
577, Negative Emotion 466, Causation 332, and Anger
244), and “kill” verbs appear as a feature in 94 sentences.
Note that one sentence often matches multiple selection
criteria. Of the 1,041-sentence sample, 232 (22.3%) are
from American Thinker, 169 (16.2%) from Digby, 246
(23.6%) from Hot Air, 73 (7.0%) from Michelle Malkin,
166 (15.9%) from Think Progress, and 155 (14.9%) from
Talking Points Memo.

3 Mechanical Turk Experiment
We prepared 1,100 Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs),
each containing one sentence annotation task. 1,041 sen-
tences were annotated five times each (5,205 judgements
total). One annotation task consists of three bias judge-
ment questions plus four survey questions. We priced
each HIT between $0.02 and $0.04 (moving from less
to more to encourage faster completion). The total cost
was $212.15 We restricted access to our tasks to those
who resided in United States and who had above 90% ap-
proval history, to ensure quality and awareness of Amer-
ican political issues. We also discarded HITs annotated
by workers with particularly low agreement scores. The
time allowance for each HIT was set at 5 minutes.

3.1 Annotation Results
3.1.1 Distribution of Judgments

Overall, more than half the judgments are “not biased,”
and the “very biased” label is used sparingly (Table 2).
There is a slight tendency among the annotators to assign
the “very conservative” label, although moderate bias is
distributed evenly on both side (Table 3). Interestingly,
there are many “biased, but not sure” labels, indicating
that the annotators are capable of perceiving bias (or ma-
nipulative language), without fully decoding the intent of
the author, given sentences out of context.

3.1.2 Annotation Quality
In this study, we are interested in where the wisdom of

the crowd will take us, or where the majority consensus
on bias may emerge. For this reason we did not contrive a
gold standard for “correct” annotation. We are, however,
mindful of its overall quality—whether annotations have

reasonable agreement, and whether there are fraudulent
responses tainting the results.

To validate our data, we measured the pair-wise Kappa
statistic (Cohen, 1960) among the 50 most frequent work-
ers16 and took the average over all the scores.17. The
average of the agreement score for the first question is
0.55, and the second 0.50. Those are within the range of
reasonable agreement for moderately difficult task. We
also inspected per worker average scores for frequent
workers18 and found one with consistently low agreement
scores. We discarded all the HITs by this worker from our
results. We also manually inspected the first 200 HITs for
apparent frauds. The annotations appeared to be consis-
tent. Often annotators agreed (many “no bias” cases were
unanimous), or differed in only the degree of strength
(“very biased” vs. “biased”) or specificity (“biased but I
am not sure” vs. “moderately liberal”). The direction of
bias, if specified, was very rarely inconsistent.

Along with the annotation tasks, we asked workers
how we could improve our HITs. Some comments were

16258 workers participated; only 50 of them completed more than 10
annotations.

17Unlike traditional subjects for a user-annotation study, our annota-
tors have not judged all the sentences considered in the study. There-
fore, to compute the agreement, we considered only the case where two
annotators share 20 or more sentences.

insightful for our study (as well as for the interface de-
sign). A few pointed out that an impolite statement or
a statement of negative fact is not the same as bias, and
therefore should be marked separately from bias. Others
mentioned that some sentences are difficult to judge out
of context. These comments will be taken into account in
future research.

4 Analysis and Significance
In the following section we report some of the interesting
trends we found in our annotation results. We consider a
few questions and report the answers the data provide for
each.

4.1 Is a sentence from a liberal blog more likely be
seen as liberal?

In our sample sentence pool, conservatives and liberals
are equally represented, though each blog site has a dif-
ferent representation.19 We grouped sentences by source
site, then computed the percentage representation of each
site within each bias label; see Table 5. In the top row,
we show the percentage representation of each group in
overall judgements.

In general, a site yields more sentences that match its
known political leanings. Note that in our annotation
task, we did not disclose the sentence’s source to the
workers. The annotators formed their judgements solely
based on the content of the sentence. This result can
be taken as confirming people’s ability to perceive bias
within a sentence, or, conversely, as confirming our a pri-
ori categorizations of the blogs.

in the pool.

conservative bias?

other in terms of the bias annotators perceive in their lan-

guage. In general, conservative sites seemingly produced
much more identifiable partisan bias than liberal sites.20

This impression, however, might be an artifact of the
distribution of the annotators’ own bias. As seen in Ta-
ble 4, a large portion of our annotators identified them-
selves as liberal in some way. People might call a state-
ment biased if they disagree with it, while showing le-
niency toward hyperbole more consistent with their opin-
ions.

To answer this question, we break down the judgement
labels by the annotators’ self-identification, and check
the percentage of each bias type within key groups (see
Figure 2). In general, moderates perceive less bias than
partisans (another useful reality check, in the sense that
this is to be expected), but conservatives show a much
stronger tendency to label sentences as biased, in both
directions. (We caution that the underrepresentation of
self-identifying conservatives in our worker pool means
that only 608 judgments from 48 distinct workers were
used to estimate these statistics.) Liberals in this sample
are less balanced, perceiving conservative bias at double
the rate of liberal bias.

4.3 What are the lexical indicators of perceived
bias?

For a given word type w, we calculate the frequency that
it was marked as indicating bias, normalized by its total
number of occurrences. To combine the judgments of dif-
ferent annotators, we increment w’s count by k/n when-
ever k judgments out of n marked the word as showing
bias. We perform similar calculations with a restriction
to liberal and conservative judgments on the sentence as a

20Liberal sites cumulatively produced 64.9% of the moderately lib-
eral bias label and 70.1 % of very liberal, while conservative sites pro-
duced 66.0% of moderately conservative and 76.4% of very conserva-
tive, respectively.

whole. Top-ranked words for each calculation are shown
in Table 6.

Some of the patterns we see are consistent with what
we found in our automatic method for proposing biased
bigrams. For example, the bigrams tended to include
terms that refer to members or groups on the opposing
side. Here we find that Republican and Administration
(referring in 2008 to the Bush administration) tends to
show liberal bias, while Obama’s and Democrats show
conservative bias.

5 Discussion and Future Work

The study we have conducted here represents an initial
pass at empirical, corpus-driven analysis of bias using the
methods of computational linguistics. The results thus far
suggest that it is possible to automatically extract a sam-
ple that is rich in examples that annotators would con-
sider biased; that naı̈ve annotators can achieve reason-
able agreement with minimal instructions and no train-
ing; and that basic exploratory analysis of results yields
interpretable patterns that comport with prior expecta-
tions, as well as interesting observations that merit further
investigation.

In future work, enabled by annotations of biased and
non-biased material, we plan to delve more deeply into
the linguistic characteristics associated with biased ex-
pression. These will include, for example, an analysis
of the extent to which explicit “lexical framing” (use of
partisan terms, e.g., Monroe et al., 2008) is used to con-
vey bias, versus use of more subtle cues such as syntactic
framing (Greene and Resnik, 2009). We will also explore
the extent to which idiomatic usages are connected with
bias, with the prediction that partisan “memes” tend to be
more idiomatic than compositional in nature.

In our current analysis, the issue of subjectivity was not
directly addressed. Previous work has shown that opin-

ions are closely related to subjective language (Pang and
Lee, 2008). It is possible that asking annotators about
sentiment while asking about bias would provide a deeper
understanding of the latter. Interestingly, annotator feed-
back included remarks that mere negative “facts” do not
convey an author’s opinion or bias. The nature of subjec-
tivity as a factor in bias perception is an important issue
for future investigation.

6 Conclusion
This paper considered the linguistic indicators of bias in
political text. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk judg-
ments about sentences from American political blogs,
asking annotators to indicate whether a sentence showed
bias, and if so, in which political direction and through
which word tokens; these data were augmented by a po-
litical questionnaire for each annotator. Our preliminary
analysis suggests that bias can be annotated reasonably
consistently, that bias perception varies based on personal
views, and that there are some consistent lexical cues for
bias in political blog data.
