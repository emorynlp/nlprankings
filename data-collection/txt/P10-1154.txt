Abstract

One of the main obstacles to high-
performance Word Sense Disambigua-
tion (WSD) is the knowledge acquisi-
tion bottleneck. In this paper, we present
a methodology to automatically extend
WordNet with large amounts of seman-
tic relations from an encyclopedic re-
source, namely Wikipedia. We show
that, when provided with a vast amount
of high-quality semantic relations, sim-
ple knowledge-lean disambiguation algo-
rithms compete with state-of-the-art su-
pervised WSD systems in a coarse-grained
all-words setting and outperform them on
gold-standard domain-specific datasets.

1 Introduction

Knowledge lies at the core of Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (WSD), the task of computation-
ally identifying the meanings of words in context
(Navigli, 2009b). In the recent years, two main
approaches have been studied that rely on a fixed
sense inventory, i.e., supervised and knowledge-
based methods. In order to achieve high perfor-
mance, supervised approaches require large train-
ing sets where instances (target words in con-
text) are hand-annotated with the most appropri-
ate word senses. Producing this kind of knowl-
edge is extremely costly: at a throughput of one
sense annotation per minute (Edmonds, 2000)
and tagging one thousand examples per word,
dozens of person-years would be required for en-
abling a supervised classifier to disambiguate all
the words in the English lexicon with high accu-
racy. In contrast, knowledge-based approaches ex-
ploit the information contained in wide-coverage
lexical resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum,
1998). However, it has been demonstrated that
the amount of lexical and semantic information

contained in such resources is typically insuffi-
cient for high-performance WSD (Cuadros and
Rigau, 2006). Several methods have been pro-
posed to automatically extend existing resources
(cf. Section 2) and it has been shown that highly-
interconnected semantic networks have a great im-
pact on WSD (Navigli and Lapata, 2010). How-
ever, to date, the real potential of knowledge-rich
WSD systems has been shown only in the presence
of either a large manually-developed extension of
WordNet (Navigli and Velardi, 2005) or sophisti-
cated WSD algorithms (Agirre et al., 2009).

The contributions of this paper are two-fold.
First, we relieve the knowledge acquisition bot-
tleneck by developing a methodology to extend
WordNet with millions of semantic relations. The
relations are harvested from an encyclopedic re-
source, namely Wikipedia. Wikipedia pages are
automatically associated with WordNet senses,
and topical, semantic associative relations from
Wikipedia are transferred to WordNet, thus pro-
ducing a much richer lexical resource. Sec-
ond, two simple knowledge-based algorithms that
exploit our extended WordNet are applied to
standard WSD datasets. The results show that
the integration of vast amounts of semantic re-
lations in knowledge-based systems yields per-
formance competitive with state-of-the-art super-
vised approaches on open-text WSD. In addition,
we support previous findings from Agirre et al.
(2009) that in a domain-specific WSD scenario
knowledge-based systems perform better than su-
pervised ones, and we show that, given enough
knowledge, simple algorithms perform better than
more sophisticated ones.

2 Related Work

In the last three decades, a large body of work
has been presented that concerns the develop-
ment of automatic methods for the enrichment of
existing resources such as WordNet. These in-

1522



clude proposals to extract semantic information
from dictionaries (e.g. Chodorow et al. (1985)
and Rigau et al. (1998)), approaches using lexico-
syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992; Cimiano et al.,
2004; Girju et al., 2006), heuristic methods based
on lexical and semantic regularities (Harabagiu et
al., 1999), taxonomy-based ontologization (Pen-
nacchiotti and Pantel, 2006; Snow et al., 2006).
Other approaches include the extraction of seman-
tic preferences from sense-annotated (Agirre and
Martinez, 2001) and raw corpora (McCarthy and
Carroll, 2003), as well as the disambiguation of
dictionary glosses based on cyclic graph patterns
(Navigli, 2009a). Other works rely on the dis-
ambiguation of collocations, either obtained from
specialized learner’s dictionaries (Navigli and Ve-
lardi, 2005) or extracted by means of statistical
techniques (Cuadros and Rigau, 2008), e.g. based
on the method proposed by Agirre and de Lacalle
(2004). But while most of these methods represent
state-of-the-art proposals for enriching lexical and
taxonomic resources, none concentrates on aug-
menting WordNet with associative semantic rela-
tions for many domains on a very large scale. To
overcome this limitation, we exploit Wikipedia, a
collaboratively generated Web encyclopedia.

The use of collaborative contributions from vol-
unteers has been previously shown to be beneficial
in the Open Mind Word Expert project (Chklovski
and Mihalcea, 2002). However, its current status
indicates that the project remains a mainly aca-
demic attempt. In contrast, due to its low en-
trance barrier and vast user base, Wikipedia pro-
vides large amounts of information at practically
no cost. Previous work aimed at transforming
its content into a knowledge base includes open-
domain relation extraction (Wu and Weld, 2007),
the acquisition of taxonomic (Ponzetto and Strube,
2007a; Suchanek et al., 2008; Wu and Weld, 2008)
and other semantic relations (Nastase and Strube,
2008), as well as lexical reference rules (Shnarch
et al., 2009). Applications using the knowledge
contained in Wikipedia include, among others,
text categorization (Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2006), computing semantic similarity of texts
(Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007; Ponzetto and
Strube, 2007b; Milne and Witten, 2008a), coref-
erence resolution (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007b),
multi-document summarization (Nastase, 2008),
and text generation (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009).

In our work we follow this line of research and

show that knowledge harvested from Wikipedia
can be used effectively to improve the perfor-
mance of a WSD system. Our proposal builds on
previous insights from Bunescu and Paşca (2006)
and Mihalcea (2007) that pages in Wikipedia can
be taken as word senses. Mihalcea (2007) manu-
ally maps Wikipedia pages to WordNet senses to
perform lexical-sample WSD. We extend her pro-
posal in three important ways: (1) we fully autom-
atize the mapping between Wikipedia pages and
WordNet senses; (2) we use the mappings to en-
rich an existing resource, i.e. WordNet, rather than
annotating text with sense labels; (3) we deploy
the knowledge encoded by this mapping to per-
form unrestricted WSD, rather than apply it to a
lexical sample setting.

Knowledge from Wikipedia is injected into a
WSD system by means of a mapping to Word-
Net. Previous efforts aimed at automatically link-
ing Wikipedia to WordNet include full use of the
first WordNet sense heuristic (Suchanek et al.,
2008), a graph-based mapping of Wikipedia cat-
egories to WordNet synsets (Ponzetto and Nav-
igli, 2009), a model based on vector spaces (Ruiz-
Casado et al., 2005) and a supervised approach
using keyword extraction (Reiter et al., 2008).
These latter methods rely only on text overlap
techniques and neither they take advantage of the
input from Wikipedia being semi-structured, e.g.
hyperlinked, nor they propose a high-performing
probabilistic formulation of the mapping problem,
a task to which we turn in the next section.

3 Extending WordNet

Our approach consists of two main phases: first,
a mapping is automatically established between
Wikipedia pages and WordNet senses; second, the
relations connecting Wikipedia pages are trans-
ferred to WordNet. As a result, an extended ver-
sion of WordNet is produced, that we call Word-
Net++. We present the two resources used in our
methodology in Section 3.1. Sections 3.2 and 3.3
illustrate the two phases of our approach.

3.1 Knowledge Resources

WordNet. Being the most widely used compu-
tational lexicon of English in Natural Language
Processing, WordNet is an essential resource for
WSD. A concept in WordNet is represented as a
synonym set, or synset, i.e. the set of words which
share a common meaning. For instance, the con-

1523



cept of soda drink is expressed as:

{ pop2n, soda2n, soda pop1n, soda water2n, tonic2n }

where each word’s subscripts and superscripts in-
dicate their parts of speech (e.g. n stands for noun)
and sense number1, respectively. For each synset,
WordNet provides a textual definition, or gloss.
For example, the gloss of the above synset is: “a
sweet drink containing carbonated water and fla-
voring”.

Wikipedia. Our second resource, Wikipedia, is
a collaborative Web encyclopedia composed of
pages2. A Wikipedia page (henceforth, Wikipage)
presents the knowledge about a specific concept
(e.g. SODA (SOFT DRINK)) or named entity (e.g.
FOOD STANDARDS AGENCY). The page typi-
cally contains hypertext linked to other relevant
Wikipages. For instance, SODA (SOFT DRINK)
is linked to COLA, FLAVORED WATER, LEMON-
ADE, and many others. The title of a Wikipage
(e.g. SODA (SOFT DRINK)) is composed of the
lemma of the concept defined (e.g. soda) plus
an optional label in parentheses which specifies
its meaning in case the lemma is ambiguous
(e.g. SOFT DRINK vs. SODIUM CARBONATE). Fi-
nally, some Wikipages are redirections to other
pages, e.g. SODA (SODIUM CARBONATE) redirects
to SODIUM CARBONATE.

3.2 Mapping Wikipedia to WordNet
During the first phase of our methodology we aim
to establish links between Wikipages and Word-
Net senses. Formally, given the entire set of pages
SensesWiki and WordNet senses SensesWN, we aim
to acquire a mapping:

µ : SensesWiki → SensesWN,

such that, for each Wikipage w ∈ SensesWiki:

µ(w) =


s ∈ SensesWN(w) if a link can be

established,
� otherwise,

where SensesWN(w) is the set of senses of the
lemma of w in WordNet. For example, if our

1We use WordNet version 3.0. We use word senses to un-
ambiguously denote the corresponding synsets (e.g. plane1n
for { airplane1n, aeroplane1n, plane1n }).

2http://download.wikipedia.org. We use the
English Wikipedia database dump from November 3, 2009,
which includes 3,083,466 articles. Throughout this paper, we
use Sans Serif for words, SMALL CAPS for Wikipedia pages
and CAPITALS for Wikipedia categories.

mapping methodology linked SODA (SOFT DRINK)
to the corresponding WordNet sense soda2n, we
would have µ(SODA (SOFT DRINK)) = soda2n.

In order to establish a mapping between the
two resources, we first identify different kinds of
disambiguation contexts for Wikipages (Section
3.2.1) and WordNet senses (Section 3.2.2). Next,
we intersect these contexts to perform the mapping
(see Section 3.2.3).

3.2.1 Disambiguation Context of a Wikipage
Given a target Wikipage w which we aim to map
to a WordNet sense of w, we use the following
information as a disambiguation context:

• Sense labels: e.g. given the page SODA (SOFT
DRINK), the words soft and drink are added to
the disambiguation context.

• Links: the titles’ lemmas of the pages linked
from the Wikipage w (outgoing links). For in-
stance, the links in the Wikipage SODA (SOFT
DRINK) include soda, lemonade, sugar, etc.

• Categories: Wikipages are classified accord-
ing to one or more categories, which repre-
sent meta-information used to categorize them.
For instance, the Wikipage SODA (SOFT DRINK)
is categorized as SOFT DRINKS. Since many
categories are very specific and do not appear in
WordNet (e.g., SWEDISH WRITERS or SCI-
ENTISTS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE),
we use the lemmas of their syntactic heads as
disambiguation context (i.e. writer and scien-
tist). To this end, we use the category heads
provided by Ponzetto and Navigli (2009).

Given a Wikipage w, we define its disambiguation
context Ctx(w) as the set of words obtained from
some or all of the three sources above.

3.2.2 Disambiguation Context of a WordNet
Sense

Given a WordNet sense s and its synset S, we use
the following information as disambiguation con-
text to provide evidence for a potential link in our
mapping µ:

• Synonymy: all synonyms of s in synset S. For
instance, given the synset of soda2n, all its syn-
onyms are included in the context (that is, tonic,
soda pop, pop, etc.).

1524



• Hypernymy/Hyponymy: all synonyms in the
synsets H such that H is either a hypernym
(i.e., a generalization) or a hyponym (i.e., a spe-
cialization) of S. For example, given soda2n,
we include the words from its hypernym { soft
drink1n }.

• Sisterhood: words from the sisters of S. A sister
synset S′ is such that S and S′ have a common
direct hypernym. For example, given soda2n, it
can be found that bitter lemon1n and soda2n are
sisters. Thus the words bitter and lemon are in-
cluded in the disambiguation context of s.

• Gloss: the set of lemmas of the content words
occurring within the gloss of s. For instance,
given s = soda2n, defined as “a sweet drink
containing carbonated water and flavoring”, we
add to the disambiguation context of s the fol-
lowing lemmas: sweet, drink, contain, carbon-
ated, water, flavoring.

Given a WordNet sense s, we define its disam-
biguation context Ctx(s) as the set of words ob-
tained from some or all of the four sources above.

3.2.3 Mapping Algorithm
In order to link each Wikipedia page to a Word-
Net sense, we developed a novel algorithm, whose
pseudocode is shown in Algorithm 1. The follow-
ing steps are performed:

• Initially (lines 1-2), our mapping µ is empty, i.e.
it links each Wikipage w to �.

• For each Wikipage w whose lemma is monose-
mous both in Wikipedia and WordNet (i.e.
|SensesWiki(w)| = |SensesWN(w)| = 1) we map
w to its only WordNet sense w1n (lines 3-5).

• Finally, for each remaining Wikipage w for
which no mapping was previously found (i.e.,
µ(w) = �, line 7), we do the following:

– lines 8-10: for each Wikipage d which is a
redirection to w, for which a mapping was
previously found (i.e. µ(d) 6= �, that is, d is
monosemous in both Wikipedia and Word-
Net) and such that it maps to a sense µ(d) in
a synset S that also contains a sense of w, we
map w to the corresponding sense in S.

– lines 11-14: if a Wikipage w has not been
linked yet, we assign the most likely sense
to w based on the maximization of the con-
ditional probabilities p(s|w) over the senses

Algorithm 1 The mapping algorithm
Input: SensesWiki, SensesWN
Output: a mapping µ : SensesWiki → SensesWN

1: for each w ∈ SensesWiki
2: µ(w) := �
3: for each w ∈ SensesWiki
4: if |SensesWiki(w)| = |SensesWN(w)| = 1 then
5: µ(w) := w1n
6: for each w ∈ SensesWiki
7: if µ(w) = � then
8: for each d ∈ SensesWiki s.t. d redirects to w
9: if µ(d) 6= � and µ(d) is in a synset of w then

10: µ(w) := sense of w in synset of µ(d); break
11: for each w ∈ SensesWiki
12: if µ(w) = � then
13: if no tie occurs then
14: µ(w) := argmax

s∈SensesWN(w)
p(s|w)

15: return µ

s ∈ SensesWN(w) (no mapping is established
if a tie occurs, line 13).

As a result of the execution of the algorithm, the
mapping µ is returned (line 15). At the heart of the
mapping algorithm lies the calculation of the con-
ditional probability p(s|w) of selecting the Word-
Net sense s given the Wikipage w. The sense s
which maximizes this probability can be obtained
as follows:

µ(w) = argmax
s∈SensesWN(w)

p(s|w) = argmax
s

p(s, w)
p(w)

= argmax
s

p(s, w)

The latter formula is obtained by observing that
p(w) does not influence our maximization, as it is
a constant independent of s. As a result, the most
appropriate sense s is determined by maximizing
the joint probability p(s, w) of sense s and page w.
We estimate p(s, w) as:

p(s, w) =
score(s, w)∑

s′∈SensesWN(w),
w′∈SensesWiki(w)

score(s′, w′)
,

where score(s, w) = |Ctx(s)∩Ctx(w)|+1 (we add
1 as a smoothing factor). Thus, in our algorithm
we determine the best sense s by computing the in-
tersection of the disambiguation contexts of s and
w, and normalizing by the scores summed over all
senses of w in Wikipedia and WordNet.

3.2.4 Example
We illustrate the execution of our mapping algo-
rithm by way of an example. Let us focus on the

1525



Wikipage SODA (SOFT DRINK). The word soda
is polysemous both in Wikipedia and WordNet,
thus lines 3–5 of the algorithm do not concern
this Wikipage. Lines 6–14 aim to find a mapping
µ(SODA (SOFT DRINK)) to an appropriate WordNet
sense of the word. First, we check whether a redi-
rection exists to SODA (SOFT DRINK) that was pre-
viously disambiguated (lines 8–10). Next, we con-
struct the disambiguation context for the Wikipage
by including words from its label, links and cate-
gories (cf. Section 3.2.1). The context includes,
among others, the following words: soft, drink,
cola, sugar. We now construct the disambiguation
context for the two WordNet senses of soda (cf.
Section 3.2.2), namely the sodium carbonate (#1)
and the drink (#2) senses. To do so, we include
words from their synsets, hypernyms, hyponyms,
sisters, and glosses. The context for soda1n in-
cludes: salt, acetate, chlorate, benzoate. The
context for soda2n contains instead: soft, drink,
cola, bitter, etc. The sense with the largest inter-
section is #2, so the following mapping is estab-
lished: µ(SODA (SOFT DRINK)) = soda2n.

3.3 Transferring Semantic Relations

The output of the algorithm presented in the previ-
ous section is a mapping between Wikipages and
WordNet senses (that is, implicitly, synsets). Our
insight is to use this alignment to enable the trans-
fer of semantic relations from Wikipedia to Word-
Net. In fact, given a Wikipage w we can collect
all Wikipedia links occurring in that page. For
any such link from w to w′, if the two Wikipages
are mapped to WordNet senses (i.e., µ(w) 6= �
and µ(w′) 6= �), we can transfer the correspond-
ing edge (µ(w), µ(w′)) to WordNet. Note that µ(w)
and µ(w′) are noun senses, as Wikipages describe
nominal concepts or named entities. We refer to
this extended resource as WordNet++.

For instance, consider the Wikipage SODA
(SOFT DRINK). This page contains, among oth-
ers, a link to the Wikipage SYRUP. Assuming
µ(SODA (SODA DRINK)) = soda2n and µ(SYRUP) =
syrup1n, we can add the corresponding semantic
relation (soda2n, syrup1n) to WordNet3.

Thus, WordNet++ represents an extension of
WordNet which includes semantic associative re-
lations between synsets. These are originally

3Note that such relations are unlabeled. However, for our
purposes this has no impact, since our algorithms do not dis-
tinguish between is-a and other kinds of relations in the lexi-
cal knowledge base (cf. Section 4.2).

found in Wikipedia and then integrated into Word-
Net by means of our mapping. In turn, Word-
Net++ represents the English-only subset of a
larger multilingual resource, BabelNet (Navigli
and Ponzetto, 2010), where lexicalizations of the
synsets are harvested for many languages using
the so-called Wikipedia inter-language links and
applying a machine translation system.

4 Experiments

We perform two sets of experiments: we first eval-
uate the intrinsic quality of our mapping (Section
4.1) and then quantify the impact of WordNet++
for coarse-grained (Section 4.2) and domain-
specific WSD (Section 4.3).

4.1 Evaluation of the Mapping

Experimental setting. We first conducted an
evaluation of the mapping quality. To create
a gold standard for evaluation, we started from
the set of all lemmas contained both in Word-
Net and Wikipedia: the intersection between the
two resources includes 80,295 lemmas which cor-
respond to 105,797 WordNet senses and 199,735
Wikipedia pages. The average polysemy is 1.3 and
2.5 for WordNet senses and Wikipages, respec-
tively (2.8 and 4.7 when excluding monosemous
words). We selected a random sample of 1,000
Wikipages and asked an annotator with previous
experience in lexicographic annotation to provide
the correct WordNet sense for each page title (an
empty sense label was given if no correct mapping
was possible). 505 non-empty mappings were
found, i.e. Wikipedia pages with a corresponding
WordNet sense. In order to quantify the quality
of the annotations and the difficulty of the task,
a second annotator sense tagged a subset of 200
pages from the original sample. We computed the
inter-annotator agreement using the kappa coeffi-
cient (Carletta, 1996) and found out that our anno-
tators achieved an agreement coefficient κ of 0.9,
indicating almost perfect agreement.

Table 1 summarizes the performance of our dis-
ambiguation algorithm against the manually anno-
tated dataset. Evaluation is performed in terms of
standard measures of precision (the ratio of cor-
rect sense labels to the non-empty labels output
by the mapping algorithm), recall (the ratio of
correct sense labels to the total of non-empty la-
bels in the gold standard) and F1-measure ( 2PRP+R ).
We also calculate accuracy, which accounts for

empty sense labels (that is, calculated on all 1,000
test instances). As baseline we use the most fre-
quent WordNet sense (MFS), as well as a ran-
dom sense assignment. We evaluate the map-
ping methodology described in Section 3.2 against
different disambiguation contexts for the Word-
Net senses (cf. Section 3.2.2), i.e. structure-based
(including synonymy, hypernymy/hyponymy and
sisterhood), gloss-derived evidence, and a combi-
nation of the two. As disambiguation context of
a Wikipage (Section 3.2.1) we use all information
available, i.e. sense labels, links and categories4.

Results and discussion. The results show that
our method improves on the baseline by a large
margin and that higher performance can be
achieved by using more disambiguation informa-
tion. That is, using a richer disambiguation con-
text helps to better choose the most appropriate
WordNet sense for a Wikipedia page. The combi-
nation of structural and gloss information attains a
slight variation in terms of precision (−0.3% and
+0.8% compared to Structure and Gloss respec-
tively), but a significantly high increase in recall
(+9.4% and +13.3%). This implies that the differ-
ent disambiguation contexts only partially overlap
and, when used separately, each produces differ-
ent mappings with a similar level of precision. In
the joint approach, the harmonic mean of preci-
sion and recall, i.e. F1, is in fact 5 and 8 points
higher than when separately using structural and
gloss information, respectively.

As for the baselines, the most frequent sense is
just 0.6% and 0.4% above the random baseline in
terms of F1 and accuracy, respectively. A χ2 test
reveals in fact no statistically significant difference
at p < 0.05. This is related to the random distri-
bution of senses in our dataset and the Wikipedia
unbiased coverage of WordNet senses. So select-

4We leave out the evaluation of different contexts for a
Wikipage for the sake of brevity. During prototyping we
found that the best results were given by using the largest
context available, as reported in Table 1.

ing the most frequent sense rather than any other
sense for each target page represents a choice as
arbitrary as picking a sense at random.

The final mapping contains 81,533 pairs of
Wikipages and word senses they map to, covering
55.7% of the noun senses in WordNet.

Using our best performing mapping we are
able to extend WordNet with 1,902,859 semantic
edges: of these, 97.93% are deemed novel, i.e. no
direct edge could previously be found between the
synsets. In addition, we performed a stricter eval-
uation of the novelty of our relations by check-
ing whether these can still be found indirectly by
searching for a connecting path between the two
synsets of interest. Here we found that 91.3%,
87.2% and 78.9% of the relations are novel to
WordNet when performing a graph search of max-
imum depth of 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

4.2 Coarse-grained WSD
Experimental setting. We extrinsically evalu-
ate the impact of WordNet++ on the Semeval-
2007 coarse-grained all-words WSD task (Nav-
igli et al., 2007). Performing experiments in a
coarse-grained setting is a natural choice for sev-
eral reasons: first, it has been argued that the fine
granularity of WordNet is one of the main obsta-
cles to accurate WSD (cf. the discussion in Nav-
igli (2009b)); second, the meanings of Wikipedia
pages are intuitively coarser than those in Word-
Net5. For instance, mapping TRAVEL to the first
or the second sense in WordNet is an arbitrary
choice, as the Wikipage refers to both senses. Fi-
nally, given their different nature, WordNet and
Wikipedia do not fully overlap. Accordingly,
we expect the transfer of semantic relations from
Wikipedia to WordNet to have sometimes the side
effect to penalize some fine-grained senses of a
word.

We experiment with two simple knowledge-
based algorithms that are set to perform coarse-
grained WSD on a sentence-by-sentence basis:

• Simplified Extended Lesk (ExtLesk): The first
algorithm is a simplified version of the Lesk
5Note that our polysemy rates from Section 4.1 also in-

clude Wikipages whose lemma is contained in WordNet, but
which have out-of-domain meanings, i.e. encyclopedic en-
tries referring to specialized named entities such as e.g., DIS-
COVERY (SPACE SHUTTLE) or FIELD ARTILLERY (MAGA-
ZINE). We computed the polysemy rate for a random sample
of 20 polysemous words by manually removing these NEs
and found that Wikipedia’s polysemy rate is indeed lower
than that of WordNet – i.e. average polysemy of 2.1 vs. 2.8.

1527



algorithm (Lesk, 1986), that performs WSD
based on the overlap between the context sur-
rounding the target word to be disambiguated
and the definitions of its candidate senses (Kil-
garriff and Rosenzweig, 2000). Given a tar-
get word w, this method assigns to w the
sense whose gloss has the highest overlap (i.e.
most words in common) with the context of w,
namely the set of content words co-occurring
with it in a pre-defined window (a sentence in
our case). Due to the limited context provided
by the WordNet glosses, we follow Banerjee
and Pedersen (2003) and expand the gloss of
each sense s to include words from the glosses
of those synsets in a semantic relation with s.
These include all WordNet synsets which are
directly connected to s, either by means of the
semantic pointers found in WordNet or through
the unlabeled links found in WordNet++.

• Degree Centrality (Degree): The second algo-
rithm is a graph-based approach that relies on
the notion of vertex degree (Navigli and Lap-
ata, 2010). Starting from each sense s of the tar-
get word, it performs a depth-first search (DFS)
of the WordNet(++) graph and collects all the
paths connecting s to senses of other words in
context. As a result, a sentence graph is pro-
duced. A maximum search depth is established
to limit the size of this graph. The sense of the
target word with the highest vertex degree is se-
lected. We follow Navigli and Lapata (2010)
and run Degree in a weakly supervised setting
where the system attempts no sense assignment
if the highest degree score is below a certain
(empirically estimated) threshold. The optimal
threshold and maximum search depth are es-
timated by maximizing Degree’s F1 on a de-
velopment set of 1,000 randomly chosen noun
instances from the SemCor corpus (Miller et
al., 1993). Experiments on the development
dataset using Degree on WordNet++ revealed
a performance far lower than expected. Error
analysis showed that many instances were in-
correctly disambiguated, due to the noise from
weak semantic links, e.g. the links from SODA
(SOFT DRINK) to EUROPE or AUSTRALIA. Ac-
cordingly, in order to improve the disambigua-
tion performance, we developed a filter to rule
out weak semantic relations from WordNet++.
Given a WordNet++ edge (µ(w), µ(w′)) where
w and w′ are both Wikipages and w links to w′,

we first collect all words from the category la-
bels of w and w′ into two bags of words. We re-
move stopwords and lemmatize the remaining
words. We then compute the degree of overlap
between the two sets of categories as the num-
ber of words in common between the two bags
of words, normalized in the [0, 1] interval. We fi-
nally retain the link for the DFS if such score is
above an empirically determined threshold. The
optimal value for this category overlap thresh-
old was again estimated by maximizing De-
gree’s F1 on the development set. The final
graph used by Degree consists of WordNet, to-
gether with 152,944 relations from our semantic
relation enrichment method (cf. Section 3.3).

Results and discussion. We report our results in
terms of precision, recall and F1-measure on the
Semeval-2007 coarse-grained all-words dataset
(Navigli et al., 2007). We first evaluated ExtLesk
and Degree using three different resources: (1)
WordNet only; (2) Wikipedia only, i.e. only those
relations harvested from the links found within
Wikipedia pages; (3) their union, i.e. WordNet++.
In Table 2 we report the results on nouns only. As
common practice, we compare with random sense
assignment and the most frequent sense (MFS)
from SemCor as baselines. Enriching WordNet
with encyclopedic relations from Wikipedia yields
a consistent improvement against using WordNet
(+7.1% and +4.9% F1 for ExtLesk and Degree)
or Wikipedia (+3.4% and +22.0%) alone. The
best results are obtained by using Degree with
WordNet++. The better performance of Wikipedia
against WordNet when using ExtLesk (+3.7%)
highlights the quality of the relations extracted.
However, no such improvement is found with De-

gree, due to its lower recall. Interestingly, Degree
on WordNet++ beats the MFS baseline, which is
notably a difficult competitor for unsupervised and
knowledge-lean systems.

We finally compare our two algorithms using
WordNet++ with state-of-the-art WSD systems,
namely the best unsupervised (Koeling and Mc-
Carthy, 2007, SUSSX-FR) and supervised (Chan
et al., 2007, NUS-PT) systems participating in
the Semeval-2007 coarse-grained all-words task.
We also compare with SSI (Navigli and Velardi,
2005) – a knowledge-based system that partici-
pated out of competition – and the unsupervised
proposal from Chen et al. (2009, TreeMatch). Ta-
ble 3 shows the results for nouns (1,108) and
all words (2,269 words): we use the MFS as a
back-off strategy when no sense assignment is at-
tempted. Degree with WordNet++ achieves the
best performance in the literature6. On the noun-
only subset of the data, its performance is com-
parable with SSI and significantly better than the
best supervised and unsupervised systems (+3.2%
and +4.4% F1 against NUS-PT and SUSSX-FR).
On the entire dataset, it outperforms SUSSX-FR
and TreeMatch (+4.7% and +8.1%) and its re-
call is not statistically different from that of SSI
and NUS-PT. This result is particularly interest-
ing, given that WordNet++ is extended only with
relations between nominals, and, in contrast to
SSI, it does not rely on a costly annotation effort
to engineer the set of semantic relations. Last but
not least, we achieve state-of-the-art performance
with a much simpler algorithm that is based on the
notion of vertex degree in a graph.

4.3 Domain WSD

The main strength of Wikipedia is to provide wide
coverage for many specific domains. Accord-
ingly, on the Semeval dataset our system achieves
the best performance on a domain-specific text,
namely d004, a document on computer science
where we achieve 82.9% F1 (+6.8% when com-
pared with the best supervised system, namely
NUS-PT). To test whether our performance on the
Semeval dataset is an artifact of the data, i.e. d004
coming from Wikipedia itself, we evaluated our
system on the Sports and Finance sections of the
domain corpora from Koeling et al. (2005). In Ta-
ble 4 we report our results on these datasets and
compare them with Personalized PageRank, the
state-of-the-art system from Agirre et al. (2009)7,
as well as Static PageRank and a k-NN supervised
WSD system trained on SemCor.

The results we obtain on the two domains with
our best configuration (Degree using WordNet++)
outperform by a large margin k-NN, thus sup-
porting the findings from Agirre et al. (2009)
that knowledge-based systems exhibit a more ro-
bust performance than their supervised alterna-
tives when evaluated across different domains. In
addition, our system achieves better results than
Static and Personalized PageRank, indicating that
competitive disambiguation performance can still
be achieved by a less sophisticated knowledge-
based WSD algorithm when provided with a rich
amount of high-quality knowledge. Finally, the
results show that WordNet++ enables competitive
performance also in a fine-grained domain setting.

7We compare only with those system configurations per-
forming token-based WSD, i.e. disambiguating each instance
of a target word separately, since our aim is not to perform
type-based disambiguation.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented a large-scale
method for the automatic enrichment of a com-
putational lexicon with encyclopedic relational
knowledge8. Our experiments show that the large
amount of knowledge injected into WordNet is of
high quality and, more importantly, it enables sim-
ple knowledge-based WSD systems to perform as
well as the highest-performing supervised ones in
a coarse-grained setting and to outperform them
on domain-specific text. Thus, our results go
one step beyond previous findings (Cuadros and
Rigau, 2006; Agirre et al., 2009; Navigli and La-
pata, 2010) and prove that knowledge-rich dis-
ambiguation is a competitive alternative to super-
vised systems, even when relying on a simple al-
gorithm. We note, however, that the present con-
tribution does not show which knowledge-rich al-
gorithm performs best with WordNet++. In fact,
more sophisticated approaches, such as Personal-
ized PageRank (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), could be
still applied to yield even higher performance. We
leave such exploration to future work. Moreover,
while the mapping has been used to enrich Word-
Net with a large amount of semantic edges, the
method can be reversed and applied to the ency-
clopedic resource itself, that is Wikipedia, to per-
form disambiguation with the corresponding sense
inventory (cf. the task of wikification proposed
by Mihalcea and Csomai (2007) and Milne and
Witten (2008b)). In this paper, we focused on
English Word Sense Disambiguation. However,
since WordNet++ is part of a multilingual seman-
tic network (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2010), we plan
to explore the impact of this knowledge in a mul-
tilingual setting.
