Abstract 

This article reports some initial results from the collaborative work on converting SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme used in the 
Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus to ISO DA annotation framework, as part of our on-going research on the interoperability of 
standardized linguistic annotations. A qualitative assessment of the conversion between the two annotation schemes was performed to 
verify the applicability of the new ISO standard using authentic transcribed speech. The results show that in addition to a major part of 
the SWBD-DAMSL tag set that can be converted to the ISO DA scheme automatically, some problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags still 
need to be handled manually. We shall report the evaluation of such an application based on the preliminary results from automatic 
mapping via machine learning techniques. The paper will also describe a user-friendly graphical interface that was designed for manual 
manipulation. The paper concludes with discussions and suggestions for future work. 
 
 
 

1. Introduction 
This article describes the collaborative work on applying 

the newly proposed ISO standard for dialogue act 

annotation to the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) 

Corpus, as part of our on-going effort to promote 

interoperability of standardized linguistic annotations 

with the ultimate goal of developing shared and open 

language resources.  

Dialogue acts (DA) play a key role in the 

interpretation of the communicative behaviour of 

dialogue participants and offer valuable insight into the 

design of human-machine dialogue systems (Bunt et al., 

2010). More recently, the emerging ISO DIS 24617-2 

(2010) standard for dialogue act annotation defines 

dialogue acts as the ‘communicative activity of a 

participant in dialogue interpreted as having a certain 

communicative function and semantic content, and 

possibly also having certain functional dependence 

relations, rhetorical relations and feedback dependence 

relations’ (p. 3). The semantic content specifies the 

objects, relations, events, etc. that the dialogue act is 

about; the communicative function can be viewed as a 

specification of the way an addressee uses the semantic 

content to update his or her information state when he or 

she understands the corresponding stretch of dialogue. 

Continuing efforts have been made to identify and 

classify the dialogue acts expressed in dialogue utterances 

taking into account the empirically proven 

multifunctionality of utterances, i.e., the fact that 

utterances often express more than one dialogue act (see 

Bunt, 2009 and 2011). In other words, an utterance in 

dialogue typically serves several functions. See Example 

(1) taken from the SWBD-DA Corpus 

(sw_0097_3798.utt). 

 

(1) A: Well, Michael, what do you think about, uh, 

funding for AIDS research? Do you… 

B:   Well, uh, uh, that’s something I’ve thought a lot 

about.  

 

With the first utterance, Speaker A performs two 

dialogue acts: he (a) assigns the next turn to the 

participant Michael, and (b) formulates an open question. 

Speaker B, in his response, (a) accepts the turn, (b) stalls 

for time, and (c) answers the question by making a 

statement.  

Our concern in this paper is to explore the 

applicability of the new ISO Standard to the existing 

Switchboard corpus with joint efforts of automatic and 

manual mapping. In the rest of the paper, we shall first 

describe the Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) 

Corpus and its annotation scheme (i.e. SWBD-DAMSL). 

We shall then describe the new ISO Standard and explain 

our mapping of SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO DIS 24617-2 

DA tag set. In addition, machine learning techniques are 

employed for automatic DA classification on the basis of 

lexical features to evaluate the application of the new ISO 

DA scheme using authentic transcribed speech. We shall 

then introduce the user interface designed for manual 

mapping and explain the annotation guidelines. Finally, 

the paper will conclude with discussions and suggestions 

for future work.  

2. Corpus Resource 
This study uses the Switchboard Dialog Act (SWBD-DA) 

Corpus as the corpus resource, which is available online 

from the Linguistic Data Consortium

contains 1,155 5-minute conversations

, orthographically 

transcribed in about 1.5 million word tokens. It should be 

noted that the minimal unit of utterances for DA 

annotation in the SWBD Corpus is the so called “slash 

unit” (Meteer and Taylor, 1995), defined as “maximally a 

sentence but can be smaller unit” (p. 16), and “slash-units 

below the sentence level correspond to those parts of the 

narrative which are not sentential but which the annotator 

interprets as complete” (p. 16). See Table 1 for the basic 

statistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus. 

 

Table 1: Basic Statistics of the SWBD-DA Corpus 

 

Altogether, the corpus comprises 223,606 slash-units and 

each is annotated for its communicative function 

according to a set of dialogue acts specified in the 

SWBD-DAMSL scheme (Jurafsky et al., 1997) and 

assigned a DA tag. See Example (2) taken from 

sw_0002_4330.utt, where qy is the DA tag for yes/no 

questions.  

 

(2) qy   A.1 utt1: {D Well, } {F uh, } does the company 

you work for test for drugs? /   

 

A total of 303 different DA tags are identified throughout 

the corpus, which is different from the total number of 

220 tags mentioned in Jurafsky et al. (1997: 3). To ensure 

enough instances for the different DA tags, we also 

conflated the DA tags together with their secondary 

carat-dimensions, and yet we did not use the seven special 

groupings by Jurafsky et al. (1997) as we kept them as 

separate DA types (see Section 4 for further explanations). 

In the end, the 303 tags were clustered into 60 different 

individual communicative functions. See Table 2 for the 

basic statistics of the 60 DA clusters.  

According to Table 2, we observe that the 60 DA 

clusters range from 780,570 word tokens for the 

top-ranking statement-non-opinion to only 4 word

 Past studies (e.g. Stolcke et al., 2000; Jurafsky et al., 

1997; Jurafsky et al., 1998a; Jurafsky et al., 1998b) have 
been focused on only 1115 conversations in the 
SWBD-DA Corpus as the training set. As there is no clear 
description which 40 conversations have been used as the 
testing set or for future use, we use all the 1155 
conversations.   

tokens for you’re-welcome. In Table 2, the Token % 

column lists the relative importance of DA types 

measured as the proportion of the word tokens in the 

SWBD-DA corpus as whole. It can be observed that, as 

yet another example to illustrate the uneven use of DA 

types, statement-opinion accounts for 21.04% of the 

total number of word tokens in the corpus.

see that the top 10 DA types alone account for 93.38% of 

the whole corpus, suggesting again the uneven occurrence 

of DA types in the corpus and hence the disproportional 

use of communication functions in conversational 

discourse.  

It is particularly worth mentioning that 

segment-(multi-utterance) is not really a DA type 

indicating communicative function and yet it is the third 

most frequent DA tag in SWBD-DAMSL.  As a matter of 

fact, the SWBD-DAMSL annotation scheme contains 

quite a number of such non-communicative DA tags, such 

as abandoned, and quoted-material. 

3. ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) 
A basic premise of the emerging ISO standard for 

dialogue act annotation, i.e., ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010), is 

that utterances in dialogue are often multifunctional; 

hence the standard supports so-called ‘multidimensional 

tagging’, i.e., the tagging of utterances with multiple DA 

tags. It does so in two ways: First of all, it defines nine 

dimensions to which a dialogue act can belong: 

· Task 
· Auto-Feedback 
· Allo-Feedback 
· Turn Management 
· Time Management 
· Discourse Structuring 
· Social Obligations Management 
· Own Communication Management 
· Partner Communication Management 

Secondly, it takes a so-called ‘functional segment’ as 

the unit in dialogue to be tagged with DA information, 

defined as a ‘minimal stretch of communicative behavior 

that has one or more communicative functions’ (Bunt et 

al., 2010). A functional segment is allowed to be 

discontinuous, and to overlap with or be included in 

another functional segment. A functional segment may be 

tagged with at most one DA tag for each dimension. 

Another important feature is that an ISO DA tag 

consists not only of a communicative function encoding, 

but also of a dimension indication, with optional attributes 

for representing certainty, conditionality, sentiment, and 

links to other dialogue units expressing semantic, 

rhetorical and feedback relations. 

Thus, two broad differences can be observed between 

SWBD-DAMSL and ISO. The first concerns the 

treatment of the basic unit of analysis. While in 

SWBD-DAMSL this is the slash-unit, ISO DIS 24617-2 

(2010) employs the functional segment, which serves well 

to emphasise the multifunctionality of dialogue utterances. 

An important difference here is that the ISO scheme 

identifies multiple DAs per segment and assigns multiple 

tags via the stand-off annotation mechanism. 

The second difference is that each slash-unit (or 

utterance) in the SWBD-DA Corpus is annotated with one 

SWBD-DAMSL label, while each DA tag in the ISO 

scheme is additionally associated with a dimension tag 

and, when appropriate, with function qualifiers and 

relations to other dialogue units. See the following 

example taken from the Schiphol Corpus. 

 

(3) A: I’m most grateful for your help 

 

While the utterance in Example (3) would be annotated 

with only a functional tag in SWBD-DAMSL, it is 

annotated to contain the communicative function ‘inform’ 

and in addition the dimension of social obligation 

management:  

 

    communicativeFunction = “inform” 

  dimension = “socialObligationManagement” 

4. Mapping SWBD-DAMSL to ISO  

4.1 Data Pre-processing 

For the benefit of the current study and potential 

follow-up work, the banners between folders were 

removed and each slash-unit was extracted to create a set 

of files. See Example (4), the tenth slash-unit taken from 

the file sw_0052_4378.utt in the folder sw00.    

 

(4) sd     B.7 utt1: {C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we’ve  

                             done <sigh> lots to it. /  

 

The following set of files is created: 

 

sw00-0052-0010-B007-01.txt  the original utterance 

sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-S.da  SWBD-DAMSL tag 

 

In the .txt file, there is the original utterance:  

 

     {C And,} {F uh,} <inhaling> we’ve                             

done <sigh> lots to it. /  

 

While the *-S.da file only contains the DA label: sd^t. 

Still another one or more files (depending on the number 

of dimensions) will be added to this set after converting 

the SWBD-DAMSL to the ISO tag sets.  Take Example (4) 

for instance. Two more files will be created, namely,   

 

sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-0.da  ISO DA tag 

sw00-0052-0010-B007-01-ISO-1.da  ISO DA tag 

 

The *-ISO-0.da file will contain in this case:  

 

   communicativeFunction = “inform” 

   dimension = “task”
3
 

 

and the *-ISO-1.da file will contain
4
:  

 

   communicativeFunction = “stalling” 

   dimension = “timeManagement” 

                                                           
3
 The same function Inform have been observed to occur 

in different dimensions. See ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010) for 
detailed description.

 See Section 4.2 for more explanation of the multi-layer 

annotations in ISO standard.

4.2 Assessment of the Conversion 

When mapping SWBD-DAMSL tags to functional ISO 

tags, it is achieved in terms of semantic contents rather 

than the surface labels. To be more exact, four situations 

were identified in the matching process.  

The first is what is named as “exact matches”. It is 

worth mentioning that since we are not matching the 

labels in the two annotation schemes, even for the exact 

matches, the naming in SWBD-DAMSL is not always the 

same as that in the ISO scheme, but they have the same or 

very similar meaning. Table 3 lists the exact matches.

Table 3: Exact Matches 

It can also be noted that in the previous study on the 42 

DA types in SWBD-DAMSL, open-option (oo), 

offer (co), commit (cc) are treated as one DA type. In 

the current study, they are treated as individual DA types, 

which makes more sense especially when mapping to the 

ISO DA tag sets since each of them corresponds to a 

different ISO tag, suggest, offer, and promise 

respectively.   The same is also true for the 

you’re-welcome (fw) and correct-misspeaking 

(bc), which are combined together in SWBD-DAMSL 

and correspond to different ISO DA label.

Table 4: Many-to-one Matches 

The second situation is where more than one 

SWBD-DAMSL tags can be matched to the one ISO DA 

type, as defined as many-to-one matches. Table 4 shows 

the many-to-one matches. Such matches occur because 

semantically identical functions are sometimes given 

different names in SWBD-DAMSL in order to distinguish 

differences in lexical or syntactic form. For example, an 

affirmative non-yes answer is defined as an 

affirmative answer that does not contain the word yes or 

one of its variants (like yeah and yep). 

 The most complex issue is with the one-to-many 

matches, where a DA function in SWBD-DAMSL is too 

general and corresponds to a set of different DAs in the 

ISO scheme. Consider the DA type of accept in 

SWBD-DAMSL. It is a broad function applicable to a 

range of different situations. For instance, accept 

annotated as aa in Example (5) taken from 

sw_0005_4646.utt corresponds to Agreement in ISO 

DIS 24617-2 (2010). 

 

(5) sd    A.25 utt1: {C Or } people send you there as a  

                                  last resort. / 

     aa     B.26 utt1: Right,  / 

 

However, accept (aa) in Example (6) taken from 

sw_0098_3830.utt actually corresponds to 

acceptOffer in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).  

 

(6) co    B.26 utt1: I can tell you my last job or --/ 

      aa    A.27 utt1: Okay,  / 

 

As a matter of fact, accept in SWBD-DAMSL may 

correspond to several different DAs in the ISO tag set 

such as: 

· Agreement  
· AcceptRequest (addressRequest) 
· AccpetSuggestion (addressSuggestion) 
· AcceptOffer (addressOffer) 
· etc. 

 

Other cases include reject, action-directive and 

other answers.  

Finally, the remaining tags are unique to 

SWBD-DAMSL, including  

 

· quoted material 
· uninterpretable 
· abandoned 
· self-talk 
· 3rd-party-talk 
· double labels  
· explicit-performative  
· exclamation 
· other-forward-function 

 

It is not difficult to notice that 6 out of the 9 DA types 

mainly concern the marking up of other phenomena than 

dialogue acts. The last three unique DA types only 

account for a marginal portion of the whole set, about 

0.03% all together (See Table 2).  

64



In addition, multi-layer annotations of ISO can be 

added to the original markup of SWBD (Meteer and 

Taylor 1995), especially in cases such as Stalling and 

Self-Correction. See Example (7) taken from 

sw_0052_4378.utt. 

 

(7) sd   A.12  utt2 : [ I, + {F uh, } two months ago I ]  

                               went to Massachusetts -- /  

 

According to Meteer and Taylor (1995), the {F …} is 

used to mark up “filler” in utterances, which corresponds 

to Stalling in ISO DIS 24617-2 (2010). In addition, the 

markup of [ … + …] indicates the repairs (Meteer and 

Taylor, 1995), which suits well the definition of 

Self-correction in the ISO standard. As a result, the 

utterance in Example (7) is thus annotated in three 

dimensions:  

communicativeFunction = “inform” 

dimension = “task” 

 

communicativeFunction = “stalling” 

dimension = “timeManagement” 

 

communicativeFunction = “self-correction” 

dimension = “ownCommManagement” 

4.3 Mapping Principles 

Given the four setting of the matching, there major 

principles were made:  

1) Cases in both “exact matches” and “many-to-one 

matches” can be automatically mapped to ISO tags by 

programming. 

2) Tags that are unique to SWBD-DAMSL would not 

be considered at the current stage due to the absence of 

ISO counterparts and their marginal proportion. 

3) Cases in “one-to-many matches” are more complex 

and call for manual mapping, which will be further 

discussed in Section 6.  

4) Different DA dimensions will be also automatically 

added accordingly to each utterance in the format of 

stand-off annotation.  

5. Application Verification 
To evaluate the applicability of mapping SWBD-DAMSL 

tag set to the new ISO standard (ISO DIS 24617-2, 2010), 

machine learning techniques are employed, based on the 

preliminary results from the automatic mapping, to see 

how well the SWBD-ISO DA tags can be automatically 

identified and classified based on lexical features. The 

result is also compared with that obtained from the 

Top-15 SWBD-DAMSL tags. It will be particularly 

interesting to find out whether the emerging ISO DA 

annotation standard will produce better automatic 

prediction accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate the 

performance of automatic DA classification in the two DA 

annotation schemes by employing the unigrams as the 

feature set.  

Two classification tasks were then identified 

according to the two DA annotation schemes. Task 1 is to 

automatically classify the DA types in the 

SWBD-DAMSL. Based on the observations mentioned 

above, it was decided to use the top 15 DA types to 

investigate the distribution of word types in order to 

ascertain the lexical characteristics of DAs. Furthermore, 

since segment-(multi-utterance), abandoned, and 

quoted-material do not relate to dialogue acts per se, 

these three were replaced with rhetorical-questions,

Next, accordingly, task 2 is to classify the top 15 ISO 

DAs based on the results from the automatic mapping. It 

should be pointed out that only one layer of annotation in 

the ISO DA tags is considered in order to make the result 

comparable to that from SWBD-DAMSL, and the 

dimension of task is the priority when it comes to 

multi-layer annotations.

Table 9: Results from Task 2 

Table 9 presents the results for classification task 2. 

The DAs are arranged according to F-score in descending 

order. As can be noted, the weighted average F-score is 

83.1%, over 10% higher than task 1. To be more specific, 

Inform achieves the best F-score of 0.93, followed by 

Answer with an F-score of 0.775. The DA 

InitialGoodbye has the highest precision, of about 

97%, whereas Inform has the highest recall of over 98%. 

Similar to the results obtained in Task 1, the last four types 

of DAs in Task 2 also cannot be classified with the 

F-score of 0%. 

Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, when the data size 

for each DA type is taken into consideration, Task 2 may 

be more challenging than Task 1 in that 6 out of the 15 

SWBD-ISO DA types has a total number of word tokens 

fewer than 4,000 whereas all the 15 SWBD-DAMSL DA 

types has a total number of over 4,000. Therefore, the 

much higher average F-score suggests that the application 

of ISO standard DA scheme could lead to better 

classification performance, suggesting that the ISO DA 

standard represents a better option for automatic DA 

classification. 

To sum up, with a comparable version of the 

SWBD-DA Corpus, results from the automatic DA 

classification tasks show that the ISO DA annotation 

scheme produces better automatic prediction accuracy, 

which encourages the completion of the manual mapping. 

6. Manual Mapping 

6.1 Analysis of Problematic DA Types 

As mentioned earlier, there are mainly four problematic 

SWBD-DAMSL tags, namely, accept (aa), reject 

(ar), action-directive (ad) and other answers 

(no). They are problematic in that they carry a broad 

function applicable to a range of different situations 

according to the new ISO standard, as evidenced in the 

case of accept discussed in Section 4.2. Consequently, to 

map the problematic SWBD-DAMSL tags to the ISO tags 

calls for manual manipulation. 

A close look into those four types shows that the 

mapping could be further divided into two setting. Again, 

take accept (aa) for example. In the first setting, a 

sub-division of accept (aa) can also be automatically 

matched according to the previous utterance by the other 

speaker in the adjacent pair. See Example (8) taken from 

sw_0001_4325.utt.  

 

(8) sv     A.49 utt3: take a long time to find the right  

                                 place / 

      x      A.49 utt4: <laughter>. 

      aa     B.50 utt1: Yeah,  / 

 

Here accept (aa) corresponds to Agreement because of 

the DA type in A.49 utt3 but not the immediate previous 

DA as in A.49 utt4. With this principle, the particular 

sub-groups for automatic mapping were identified for 

accept (aa). See Table 10.

Offer AcceptOffer 

Open-option AcceptRequest 

Thanking AcceptThanking 

Apology AcceptApology 

Table 10: Sub-groups of accept for Auto Mapping 

The remaining cases, in the second setting, call for 

manual annotation. For instance, when the previous DA 

type is also a problematic one, annotators need to decide 

66



the corresponding ISO DA tag for the previous 

SWBD-DAMSL one before converting the accept (aa).  

See Example (9) taken from sw_0423_3325.utt.  

 

(9) ad    B.128 utt2: {C so } we'll just wait. / 

      aa    A.129 utt1: Okay,  / 

 
Here, action-directive (ad) is first decided as a 
suggestion, and therefore accept (aa) turns out to 
actually correspond to acceptSuggestion 
(addressSuggestion) in ISO/DIS 24617-2 (2010).  

6.2 Design of a User Interface 

Given the analysis of those four DA tags, a user-friendly 

interface was then designed to assist annotators to 

maximize the inter-annotator agreement.  See Figure 1.  

 

Figure 1: User Interface 

 

Figure 1 shows the screenshot when the targeted 

SWBD-DAMSL type is accept (aa). As can be noted 

above, the basic functional bars have been designed, 

including: 

· Input: the path of the input 
· Automatch: to filter out the sub-groups that can be 

automatically matched 

· DA Tag: the targeted problematic DAs, namely, 
· aa (accept) 
· ar (reject) 
· ad (action-directive) and 
· no (other answers) 

· Previous: to go back to the previous instance of the 
targeted DA type 

· Next: to move on to the next instance of the targeted 
DA type 

· Current: the extraction of the adjacent turns 
· Previous5T: the extraction of the previous five turns 

when necessary 

· PreviousAll: the extraction of all the previous turns 
when necessary 

· MatchInfo: Bars for mapping information with five 
options: 

Ø Four pre-defined ISO DA types 
Ø Other: a user-defined mapping with a 

two-fold function: for user defined ISO DA 

type and for extra pre-defined ISO DA types 

(since the pre-defined DA types differ for 

the four targeted SWBD-DAMSL types).  

· Output: the path of the output 
· Result: export the results to the chosen path 
 
With this computer-aided interface, three annotators are 
invited to carry out the manual mapping. They are all 
postgraduates with linguistic background. After a month 
of training on the understanding of the two annotation 
schemes (in process), they will work on the 
SWBD-DAMSL DA instances from 115 randomly chosen 
files, and map them into ISO DA tags independently. The 
kappa value will be calculated to measure the 
inter-annotator agreement.  
 

7. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we reported our efforts in applying the 
ISO-standardized dialogue act annotations to the 
Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWBD-DA) Corpus. In 
particular, the SWBD-DAMSL tags employed in the 
SWBD-DA Corpus were analyzed and mapped onto the 
ISO DA tag set (ISO DIS 24617-2 2010) according to 
their communicative functions and semantic contents. 
Such a conversion is a collaborative process involving 
both automatic mapping and manual manipulation.  With 
the results from the automatic mapping, machine learning 
techniques were employed to evaluate the applicability of 
the new ISO standard for dialogue act annotation in 
practice. With the encouraging results from the evaluation, 
the manual mapping was carried out. A user-friendly 
interface was designed to assist annotators. The 
immediate future work would be finish the manual 
mapping and thus to  produce a comparable version of the 
SWBD-DA Corpus was produced so that the two 
annotation schemes (i.e. SWBD-DAMSL vs. SWBD-ISO) 
can be effectively compared on the basis of empirical data. 
Furthermore, with the newly built resource, i.e., 
SWBD-ISO, we plan to examine the effect of 
grammatical and syntactic cues on the performance of DA 
classification, with a specific view on whether dialogue 
acts exhibit differentiating preferences for grammatical 
and syntactic constructions that have been overlooked 
before.
