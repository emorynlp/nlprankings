Abstract

Recently, hierarchical text classification has
become an active research topic. The essential
idea is that the descendant classes can share
the information of the ancestor classes in a
predefined taxonomy. In this paper, we claim
that each class has several latent concepts and
its subclasses share information with these d-
ifferent concepts respectively. Then, we pro-
pose a variant Passive-Aggressive (PA) algo-
rithm for hierarchical text classification with
latent concepts. Experimental results show
that the performance of our algorithm is com-
petitive with the recently proposed hierarchi-
cal classification algorithms.

1 Introduction

Text classification is a crucial and well-proven
method for organizing the collection of large scale
documents. The predefined categories are formed
by different criterions, e.g. “Entertainment”, “Sport-
s” and “Education” in news classification, “Junk E-
mail” and “Ordinary Email” in email classification.
In the literature, many algorithms (Sebastiani, 2002;
Yang and Liu, 1999; Yang and Pedersen, 1997) have
been proposed, such as Support Vector Machines
(SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naı̈ve Bayes
(NB) and so on. Empirical evaluations have shown
that most of these methods are quite effective in tra-
ditional text classification applications.

In past serval years, hierarchical text classification
has become an active research topic in database area
(Koller and Sahami, 1997; Weigend et al., 1999)
and machine learning area (Rousu et al., 2006; Cai
and Hofmann, 2007). Different with traditional clas-
sification, the document collections are organized

as hierarchical class structure in many application
fields: web taxonomies (i.e. the Yahoo! Directory
http://dir.yahoo.com/ and the Open Direc-
tory Project (ODP) http://dmoz.org/), email
folders and product catalogs.

The approaches of hierarchical text classification
can be divided in three ways: flat, local and global
approaches.

The flat approach is traditional multi-class classi-
fication in flat fashion without hierarchical class in-
formation, which only uses the classes in leaf nodes
in taxonomy(Yang and Liu, 1999; Yang and Peder-
sen, 1997; Qiu et al., 2011).

The local approach proceeds in a top-down fash-
ion, which firstly picks the most relevant categories
of the top level and then recursively making the
choice among the low-level categories(Sun and Lim,
2001; Liu et al., 2005).

The global approach builds only one classifier to
discriminate all categories in a hierarchy(Cai and
Hofmann, 2004; Rousu et al., 2006; Miao and Qiu,
2009; Qiu et al., 2009). The essential idea of global
approach is that the close classes have some com-
mon underlying factors. Especially, the descendan-
t classes can share the characteristics of the ances-
tor classes, which is similar with multi-task learn-
ing(Caruana, 1997; Xue et al., 2007).

Because the global hierarchical categorization can
avoid the drawbacks about those high-level irrecov-
erable error, it is more popular in the machine learn-
ing domain.

However, the taxonomy is defined artificially and
is usually very difficult to organize for large scale
taxonomy. The subclasses of the same parent class
may be dissimilar and can be grouped in differen-
t concepts, so it bring great challenge to hierarchi-

cal classification. For example, the “Sports” node
in a taxonomy have six subclasses (Fig. 1a), but
these subclass can be grouped into three unobserv-
able concepts (Fig. 1b). These concepts can show
the underlying factors more clearly.

In this paper, we claim that each class may have
several latent concepts and its subclasses share in-
formation with these different concepts respectively.
Then we propose a variant Passive-Aggressive (PA)
algorithm to maximizes the margins between latent
paths.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the basic model of hierarchical clas-
sification. Then we propose our algorithm in section
3. Section 4 gives experimental analysis. Section 5
concludes the paper.

2 Hierarchical Text Classification

In text classification, the documents are often rep-
resented with vector space model (VSM) (Salton et
al., 1975). Following (Cai and Hofmann, 2007),
we incorporate the hierarchical information in fea-
ture representation. The basic idea is that the notion
of class attributes will allow generalization to take
place across (similar) categories and not just across
training examples belonging to the same category.

Assuming that the categories is Ω =
[ω1, · · · , ωm], where m is the number of the
categories, which are organized in hierarchical
structure, such as tree or DAG.

Give a sample x with its class path in the taxono-
my y, we define the feature is

Φ(x,y) = Λ(y)⊗ x, (1)

where Λ(y) = (λ1(y), · · · , λm(y))T ∈ Rm and ⊗
is the Kronecker product.

We can define

λi(y) =

{
ti if ωi ∈ y
0 otherwise

, (2)

where ti >= 0 is the attribute value for node v. In
the simplest case, ti can be set to a constant, like 1.

Thus, we can classify x with a score function,

ŷ = arg max
y

F (w,Φ(x,y)), (3)

where w is the parameter of F (·).

3 Hierarchical Text Classification with
Latent Concepts

In this section, we first extent the Passive-
Aggressive (PA) algorithm to the hierarchical clas-
sification (HPA), then we modify it to incorporate
latent concepts (LHPA).

3.1 Hierarchical Passive-Aggressive Algorithm
The PA algorithm is an online learning algorithm,
which aims to find the new weight vector wt+1 to be
the solution to the following constrained optimiza-
tion problem in round t.

wt+1 = arg min
w∈Rn

1

2
||w −wt||2 + Cξ

s.t. ℓ(w; (xt, yt)) <= ξ and ξ >= 0. (4)

where ℓ(w; (xt, yt)) is the hinge-loss function and ξ
is slack variable.

Since the hierarchical text classification is loss-
sensitive based on the hierarchical structure. We
need discriminate the misclassification from “near-
ly correct” to “clearly incorrect”. Here we use tree
induced error ∆(y,y′), which is the shortest path
connecting the nodes yleaf and y′leaf . yleaf repre-
sents the leaf node in path y.

Given a example (x,y), we look for the w to
maximize the separation margin γ(w; (x,y)) be-
tween the score of the correct path y and the closest
error path ŷ.

γ(w; (x,y)) = wT Φ(x,y)−wT Φ(x, ŷ), (5)
599



where ŷ = arg maxz ̸=y wT Φ(x, z) and Φ is a fea-
ture function.

Unlike the standard PA algorithm, which achieve
a margin of at least 1 as often as possible, we wish
the margin is related to tree induced error ∆(y, ŷ).

This loss is defined by the following function,

ℓ(w; (x,y)) ={
0, γ(w; (x,y)) > ∆(y, ŷ)
∆(y, ŷ)− γ(w; (x,y)), otherwise (6)

We abbreviate ℓ(w; (x,y)) to ℓ. If ℓ = 0 then wt
itself satisfies the constraint in Eq. (4) and is clearly
the optimal solution. We therefore concentrate on
the case where ℓ > 0.

First, we define the Lagrangian of the optimiza-
tion problem in Eq. (4) to be,

L(w, ξ, α, β) = 1
2
||w−wt||2+Cξ+α(ℓ−ξ)−βξ

s.t. α, β >= 0. (7)

where α, β is a Lagrange multiplier.
We set the gradient of Eq. (7) respect to ξ to zero.

α + β = C. (8)

The gradient of w should be zero.

w −wt − α(Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)) = 0 (9)

Then we get,

w = wt + α(Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)). (10)

Substitute Eq. (8) and Eq. (10) to objective func-
tion Eq. (7), we get

L(α) = −1
2
α2||Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)||2

+ αwt(Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)))− α∆(y, ŷ) (11)

Differentiate Eq. (11 with α, and set it to zero, we
get

α∗ =
∆(y, ŷ)−wt(Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)))

||Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)||2
(12)

From α + β = C, we know that α < C, so

α∗ = min(C, ∆(y, ŷ)−wt(Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)))
||Φ(x,y)− Φ(x, ŷ)||2

).

(13)

3.2 Hierarchical Passive-Aggressive Algorithm
with Latent Concepts

For the hierarchical taxonomy Ω = (ω1, · · · , ωc),
we define that each class ωi has a set Hωi =
h1ωi , · · · , h

m
ωi with m latent concepts, which are un-

observable.
Given a label path y, it has a set of several latent

paths Hy. For a latent path z ∈ Hy, a function
Proj(z)

.
= y is the projection from a latent path z

to its corresponding path y.
Then we can define the predict latent path h∗ and

the most correct latent path ĥ:

ĥ = arg max
proj(z)̸=y

wT Φ(x, z), (14)

h∗ = arg max
proj(z)=y

wT Φ(x, z). (15)

Similar to the above analysis of HPA, we re-define
the margin

γ(w; (x,y) = wT Φ(x,h∗)− wT Φ(x, ĥ), (16)

then we get the optimal update step

α∗L = min(C,
ℓ(wt; (x,y))

||Φ(x,h∗)− Φ(x, ĥ)||2
). (17)

Finally, we get update strategy,

w = wt + α
∗
L(Φ(x,h

∗)− Φ(x, ĥ)). (18)

Our hierarchical passive-aggressive algorithm
with latent concepts (LHPA) is shown in Algorith-
m 1. In this paper, we use two latent concepts for
each class.

4 Experiment

4.1 Datasets
We evaluate our proposed algorithm on two datasets
with hierarchical category structure.

WIPO-alpha dataset The dataset1 consisted of the
1372 training and 358 testing document com-
prising the D section of the hierarchy. The
number of nodes in the hierarchy was 188, with
maximum depth 3. The dataset was processed
into bag-of-words representation with TF·IDF

weighting. No word stemming or stop-word
removal was performed. This dataset is used
in (Rousu et al., 2006).

LSHTC dataset The dataset2 has been constructed
by crawling web pages that are found in the
Open Directory Project (ODP) and translating
them into feature vectors (content vectors) and
splitting the set of Web pages into a training,
a validation and a test set, per ODP category.
Here, we use the dry-run dataset(task 1).

4.2 Performance Measurement
Macro Precision, Macro Recall and Macro F1 are
the most widely used performance measurements
for text classification problems nowadays. The
macro strategy computes macro precision and re-
call scores by averaging the precision/recall of each
category, which is preferred because the categories
are usually unbalanced and give more challenges to
classifiers. The Macro F1 score is computed using
the standard formula applied to the macro-level pre-
cision and recall scores.

P ×R

where P is the Macro Precision and R is the Macro

experiments.

4.3 Results

We implement three algorithms3: PA(Flat PA), H-
PA(Hierarchical PA) and LHPA(Hierarchical PA
with latent concepts). The results are shown in Table
1 and 2. For WIPO-alpha dataset, we also compared
LHPA with two algorithms used in (Rousu et al.,
2006): HSVM and HM3.

We can see that LHPA has better performances
than the other methods. From Table 2, we can see
that it is not always useful to incorporate the hierar-
chical information. Though the subclasses can share
information with their parent class, the shared infor-
mation may be different for each subclass. So we
should decompose the underlying factors into dif-
ferent latent concepts.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a variant Passive-
Aggressive algorithm for hierarchical text classifi-
cation with latent concepts. In the future, we will
investigate our method in the larger and more noisy
data.
