Abstract

Natural language generation (NLG) is a
critical component of spoken dialogue and
it has a significant impact both on usabil-
ity and perceived quality. Most NLG sys-
tems in common use employ rules and
heuristics and tend to generate rigid and
stylised responses without the natural vari-
ation of human language. They are also
not easily scaled to systems covering mul-
tiple domains and languages. This pa-
per presents a statistical language gener-
ator based on a semantically controlled
Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) struc-
ture. The LSTM generator can learn from
unaligned data by jointly optimising sen-
tence planning and surface realisation us-
ing a simple cross entropy training crite-
rion, and language variation can be eas-
ily achieved by sampling from output can-
didates. With fewer heuristics, an objec-
tive evaluation in two differing test do-
mains showed the proposed method im-
proved performance compared to previ-
ous methods. Human judges scored the
LSTM system higher on informativeness
and naturalness and overall preferred it to
the other systems.

1 Introduction

The natural language generation (NLG) compo-
nent provides much of the persona of a spoken
dialogue system (SDS), and it has a significant
impact on a user’s impression of the system. As
noted in Stent et al. (2005), a good generator usu-
ally depends on several factors: adequacy, flu-
ency, readability, and variation. Previous ap-
proaches attacked the NLG problem in different
ways. The most common and widely adopted
today is the rule-based (or template-based) ap-
proach (Cheyer and Guzzoni, 2007; Mirkovic and

Cavedon, 2011). Despite its robustness and ade-
quacy, the frequent repetition of identical, rather
stilted, output forms make talking to a rule-based
generator rather tedious. Furthermore, the ap-
proach does not easily scale to large open domain
systems(Young et al., 2013; Gašić et al., 2014;
Henderson et al., 2014). Hence approaches to
NLG are required that can be readily scaled whilst
meeting the above requirements.

The trainable generator approach exemplified
by the HALOGEN (Langkilde and Knight, 1998)
and SPaRKy system (Stent et al., 2004) provides
a possible way forward. These systems include
specific trainable modules within the generation
framework to allow the model to adapt to different
domains (Walker et al., 2007), or reproduce cer-
tain style (Mairesse and Walker, 2011). However,
these approaches still require a handcrafted gen-
erator to define the decision space within which
statistics can be used for optimisation. The result-
ing utterances are therefore constrained by the pre-
defined syntax and any domain-specific colloquial
responses must be added manually.

More recently, corpus-based methods (Oh and
Rudnicky, 2000; Mairesse and Young, 2014; Wen
et al., 2015) have received attention as access to
data becomes increasingly available. By defin-
ing a flexible learning structure, corpus-based
methods aim to learn generation directly from
data by adopting an over-generation and rerank-
ing paradigm (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000), in which
final responses are obtained by reranking a set of
candidates generated from a stochastic generator.
Learning from data directly enables the system to
mimic human responses more naturally, removes
the dependency on predefined rules, and makes
the system easier to build and extend to other do-
mains. As detailed in Sections 2 and 3, however,
these existing approaches have weaknesses in the
areas of training data efficiency, accuracy and nat-
uralness.

This paper presents a statistical NLG based on
a semantically controlled Long Short-term Mem-
ory (LSTM) recurrent network. It can learn from
unaligned data by jointly optimising its sentence
planning and surface realisation components us-
ing a simple cross entropy training criterion with-
out any heuristics, and good quality language vari-
ation is obtained simply by randomly sampling
the network outputs. We start in Section 3 by
defining the framework of the proposed neural lan-
guage generator. We introduce the semantically
controlled LSTM (SC-LSTM) cell in Section 3.1,
then we discuss how to extend it to a deep structure
in Section 3.2. As suggested in Wen et al. (2015),
a backward reranker is introduced in Section 3.3
to improve fluency. Training and decoding details
are described in Section 3.4 and 3.5.

Section 4 presents an evaluation of the proposed
approach in the context of an application provid-
ing information about venues in the San Francisco
area. In Section 4.2, we first show that our genera-
tor outperforms several baselines using objective
metrics. We experimented on two different on-
tologies to show not only that good performance
can be achieved across domains, but how easy and
quick the development lifecycle is. In order to as-
sess the subjective performance of our system, a
quality test and a pairwise preference test are pre-
sented in Section 4.3. The results show that our
approach can produce high quality utterances that
are considered to be more natural and are preferred
to previous approaches. We conclude with a brief
summary and future work in Section 5.

2 Related Work

Conventional approaches to NLG typically divide
the task into sentence planning and surface real-
isation. Sentence planning maps input semantic
symbols into an intermediary form representing
the utterance, e.g. a tree-like or template struc-
ture, then surface realisation converts the interme-
diate structure into the final text (Walker et al.,
2002; Stent et al., 2004). Although statistical sen-
tence planning has been explored previously, for
example, generating the most likely context-free
derivations given a corpus (Belz, 2008) or max-
imising the expected reward using reinforcement
learning (Rieser and Lemon, 2010), these meth-
ods still rely on a pre-existing, handcrafted gener-
ator. To minimise handcrafting, Stent and Molina
(2009) proposed learning sentence planning rules

directly from a corpus of utterances labelled with
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse rela-
tions (Mann and Thompson, 1988). However, the
required corpus labelling is expensive and addi-
tional handcrafting is still needed to map the sen-
tence plan to a valid syntactic form.

As noted above, corpus-based NLG aims at
learning generation decisions from data with min-
imal dependence on rules and heuristics. A pi-
oneer in this direction is the class-based n-gram
language model (LM) approach proposed by Oh
and Rudnicky (2000). Ratnaparkhi (2002) later
addressed some of the limitations of class-based
LMs in the over-generation phase by using a mod-
ified generator based on a syntactic dependency
tree. Mairesse and Young (2014) proposed a
phrase-based NLG system based on factored LMs
that can learn from a semantically aligned corpus.
Although active learning (Mairesse et al., 2010)
was also proposed to allow learning online directly
from users, the requirement for human annotated
alignments limits the scalability of the system.
Another similar approach casts NLG as a template
extraction and matching problem, e.g., Angeli et
al. (2010) train a set of log-linear models to make
a series of generation decisions to choose the most
suitable template for realisation. Kondadadi et al.
(2013) later show that the outputs can be further
improved by an SVM reranker making them com-
parable to human-authored texts. However, tem-
plate matching approaches do not generalise well
to unseen combinations of semantic elements.

The use of neural network-based (NN) ap-
proaches to NLG is relatively unexplored. The
stock reporter system ANA by Kukich (1987) is
perhaps the first NN-based generator, although
generation was only done at the phrase level. Re-
cent advances in recurrent neural network-based
language models (RNNLM) (Mikolov et al., 2010;
Mikolov et al., 2011a) have demonstrated the
value of distributed representations and the ability
to model arbitrarily long dependencies. Sutskever
et al. (2011) describes a simple variant of the RNN
that can generate meaningful sentences by learn-
ing from a character-level corpus. More recently,
Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2014) have demonstrated
that an RNNLM is capable of generating image
descriptions by conditioning the network model
on a pre-trained convolutional image feature rep-
resentation. Zhang and Lapata (2014) also de-
scribes interesting work using RNNs to generate

Chinese poetry. A forerunner of the system pre-
sented here is described in Wen et al. (2015), in
which a forward RNN generator, a CNN reranker,
and a backward RNN reranker are trained jointly
to generate utterances. Although the system was
easy to train and extend to other domains, a heuris-
tic gate control was needed to ensure that all of
the attribute-value information in the system’s re-
sponse was accurately captured by the generated
utterance. Furthermore, the handling of unusual
slot-value pairs by the CNN reranker was rather
arbitrary. In contrast, the LSTM-based system de-
scribed in this paper can deal with these problems
automatically by learning the control of gates and
surface realisation jointly.

Training an RNN with long range dependencies
is difficult because of the vanishing gradient prob-
lem (Bengio et al., 1994). Hochreiter and Schmid-
huber (1997) mitigated this problem by replacing
the sigmoid activation in the RNN recurrent con-
nection with a self-recurrent memory block and a
set of multiplication gates to mimic the read, write,
and reset operations in digital computers. The re-
sulting architecture is dubbed the Long Short-term
Memory (LSTM) network. It has been shown to
be effective in a variety of tasks, such as speech
recognition (Graves et al., 2013b), handwriting
recognition (Graves et al., 2009), spoken language
understanding (Yao et al., 2014), and machine
translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). Recent work
by Graves et al. (2014) has demonstrated that an
NN structure augmented with a carefully designed
memory block and differentiable read/write op-
erations can learn to mimic computer programs.
Moreover, the ability to train deep networks pro-
vides a more sophisticated way of exploiting rela-
tions between labels and features, therefore mak-
ing the prediction more accurate (Hinton et al.,
2012). By extending an LSTM network to be both
deep in space and time, Graves (2013) shows the
resulting network can used to synthesise handwrit-
ing indistinguishable from that of a human.

3 The Neural Language Generator

The generation model proposed in this paper is
based on a recurrent NN architecture (Mikolov et
al., 2010) in which a 1-hot encoding wt of a token1

wt is input at each time step t conditioned on a re-

1We use token instead of word because our model operates
on text for which slot values are replaced by its corresponding
slot tokens. We call this procedure delexicalisation.

current hidden layer ht and outputs the probability
distribution of the next token wt+1. Therefore, by
sampling input tokens one by one from the output
distribution of the RNN until a stop sign is gen-
erated (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2014) or some con-
straint is satisfied (Zhang and Lapata, 2014), the
network can produce a sequence of tokens which
can be lexicalised 2 to form the required utterance.

3.1 Semantic Controlled LSTM cell

Figure 1: Semantic Controlled LSTM cell pro-
posed in this paper. The upper part is a traditional
LSTM cell in charge of surface realisation, while
the lower part is a sentence planning cell based on
a sigmoid control gate and a dialogue act (DA).

Long Short-term Memory (Hochreiter and
Schmidhuber, 1997) is a recurrent NN architecture
which uses a vector of memory cells ct ∈ Rn and
a set of elementwise multiplication gates to control
how information is stored, forgotten, and exploited
inside the network. Of the various different con-
nectivity designs for an LSTM cell (Graves, 2013;
Zaremba et al., 2014), the architecture used in this
paper is illustrated in Figure 3.1 and defined by the
following equations,,

it = σ(Wwiwt + Whiht−1) (1)
ft = σ(Wwfwt + Whfht−1) (2)
ot = σ(Wwowt + Whoht−1) (3)
ĉt = tanh(Wwcwt + Whcht−1) (4)
ct = ft � ct−1 + it � ĉt (5)
ht = ot � tanh(ct) (6)

2The process of replacing slot token by its value.

1713



where σ is the sigmoid function, it, ft,ot ∈ [0, 1]n
are input, forget, and output gates respectively, and
ĉt and ct are proposed cell value and true cell
value at time t. Note that each of these vectors
has a dimension equal to the hidden layer h.

In order to ensure that the generated utter-
ance represents the intended meaning, the gen-
erator is further conditioned on a control vec-
tor d, a 1-hot representation of the dialogue act
(DA) type and its slot-value pairs. Although a re-
lated work (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2014) has sug-
gested that reapplying this auxiliary information
to the RNN at every time step can increase perfor-
mance by mitigating the vanishing gradient prob-
lem (Mikolov and Zweig, 2012; Bengio et al.,
1994), we have found that such a model also omits
and duplicates slot information in the surface re-
alisation. In Wen et al. (2015) simple heuristics
are used to turn off slot feature values in the con-
trol vector d once the corresponding slot token
has been generated. However, these heuristics can
only handle cases where slot-value pairs can be
identified by exact matching between the delexi-
calised surface text and the slot value pair encoded
in d. Cases such as binary slots and slots that take
don’t care values cannot be explicitly delexicalised
in this way and these cases frequently result in
generation errors.

To address this problem, an additional control
cell is introduced into the LSTM to gate the DA
as shown in Figure 1. This cell plays the role
of sentence planning since it manipulates the DA
features during the generation process in order to
produce a surface realisation which accurately en-
codes the input information. We call the result-
ing architecture Semantically Controlled LSTM
(SC-LSTM). Starting from the original DA 1-hot
vector d0, at each time step the DA cell decides
what information should be retained for future
time steps and discards the others,

rt = σ(Wwrwt + αWhrht−1) (7)
dt = rt � dt−1 (8)

where rt ∈ [0, 1]d is called the reading gate, and
α is a constant. Here Wwr and Whr act like key-
word and key phrase detectors that learn to asso-
ciate certain patterns of generated tokens with cer-
tain slots. Figure 3 gives an example of how these
detectors work in affecting DA features inside the
network. Equation 5 is then modified so that the

cell value ct also depends on the DA,

ct = ft � ct−1 + it � ĉt + tanh(Wdcdt) (9)

After updating Equation 6 by Equation 9, the out-
put distribution is formed by applying a softmax
function g, and the distribution is sampled to ob-
tain the next token,

P (wt+1|wt, wt−1, ...w0,dt) = g(Whoht) (10)

wt+1 ∼ P (wt+1|wt, wt−1, ...w0,dt). (11)
3.2 The Deep Structure

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) enable increased
discrimination by learning multiple layers of fea-
tures, and represent the state-of-the-art for many
applications such as speech recognition (Graves et
al., 2013b) and natural language processing (Col-
lobert and Weston, 2008). The neural language
generator proposed in this paper can be easily ex-
tended to be deep in both space and time by stack-
ing multiple LSTM cells on top of the original
structure. As shown in Figure 2, skip connections
are applied to the inputs of all hidden layers as
well as between all hidden layers and the outputs
(Graves, 2013). This reduces the number of pro-
cessing steps between the bottom of the network
and the top, and therefore mitigates the vanishing
gradient problem (Bengio et al., 1994) in the ver-
tical direction. To allow all hidden layer informa-
tion to influence the reading gate, Equation 7 is
changed to

rt = σ(Wwrwt +
∑

l

αlWlhrh
l
t−1) (12)

where l is the hidden layer index and αl is a
layer-wise constant. Since the network tends to
overfit when the structure becomes more complex,
the dropout technique (Srivastava et al., 2014) is
used to regularise the network. As suggested in
(Zaremba et al., 2014), dropout was only applied
to the non-recurrent connections, as shown in the
Figure 2. It was not applied to word embeddings
since pre-trained word vectors were used.

3.3 Backward LSTM reranking

One remaining problem in the structure described
so far is that the LSTM generator selects words
based only on the preceding history, whereas some
sentence forms depend on the backward context.
Previously, bidirectional networks (Schuster and

1714

The skip connection was adopted to mitigate the vanishing gradient, while the dropout was applied on
dashed connections to prevent co-adaptation and overfitting.

Paliwal, 1997) have been shown to be effective for
sequential problems (Graves et al., 2013a; Sunder-
meyer et al., 2014). However, applying a bidirec-
tional network directly in the SC-LSTM generator
is not straightforward since the generation process
is sequential in time. Hence instead of integrating
the bidirectional information into one network, we
trained another SC-LSTM from backward context
to choose best candidates from the forward gen-
erator outputs. In our experiments, we also found
that by tying the keyword detector weights Wwr
(see Equations 7 and 12) of both the forward and
backward networks together makes the generator
less sensitive to random initialisation.

3.4 Training

The forward generator and the backward reranker
were both trained by treating each sentence as a
mini-batch. The objective function was the cross
entropy error between the predicted word distri-
bution pt and the actual word distribution yt in
the training corpus. An l2 regularisation term
was added to the objective function for every 10
training examples as suggested in Mikolov et al.
(2011b). However, further regularisation was re-
quired for the reading gate dynamics. This re-
sulted in the following modified cost function for
each mini-match (ignoring standard l2),

F (θ) =
∑

t p
ᵀ
t log(yt) + ‖dT ‖+

∑T−1
t=0 ηξ

‖dt+1−dt‖

(13)

where dT is the DA vector at the last word index
T , and η and ξ are constants set to 10−4 and 100,
respectively. The second term is used to penalise
generated utterances that failed to render all the re-
quired slots, while the third term discourages the
network from turning more than one gate off in
a single time step. The forward and backward
networks were structured to share the same set
of word embeddings, initialised with pre-trained
word vectors (Pennington et al., 2014). The hid-
den layer size was set to be 80 for all cases, and
deep networks were trained with two hidden lay-
ers and a 50% dropout rate. All costs and gradients
were computed and stochastic gradient descent
was used to optimise the parameters. Both net-
works were trained with back propagation through
time (Werbos, 1990). In order to prevent over-
fitting, early stopping was implemented using a
held-out validation set.

3.5 Decoding

The decoding procedure is split into two phases:
(a) over-generation, and (b) reranking. In the
over-generation phase, the forward generator con-
ditioned on the given DA, is used to sequentially
generate utterances by random sampling of the
predicted next word distributions. In the reranking
phase, the cost of the backward reranker Fb(θ) is
computed. Together with the cost Ff (θ) from the
forward generator, the reranking score R is com-

1715



puted as:

R = −(Ff (θ) + Fb(θ) + λERR) (14)
where λ is a tradeoff constant, and the slot error
rate ERR is computed by exact matching the slot
tokens in the candidate utterances,

ERR =
p+ q
N

(15)

where N is the total number of slots in the DA, and
p, q is the number of missing and redundant slots
in the given realisation. Note that the ERR rerank-
ing criteria cannot handle arbitrary slot-value pairs
such as binary slots or slots that take the don’t care
value because they cannot be delexicalised and ex-
actly matched. λ is set to a large value in order to
severely penalise nonsensical outputs.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Setup
The target application for our generation system
is a spoken dialogue system providing informa-
tion about certain venues in San Francisco. In or-
der to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed
method and its performance in different domains,
we tested on two domains that talk about restau-
rants and hotels respectively. There are 8 system
dialogue act types such as inform to present infor-
mation about restaurants, confirm to check that a
slot value has been recognised correctly, and re-
ject to advise that the user’s constraints cannot be
met. Each domain contains 12 attributes (slots),
some are common to both domains and the oth-
ers are domain specific. The detailed ontologies
for the two domains are provided in Table 1. To
form a training corpus for each domain, dialogues
collected from a previous user trial (Gašić et al.,
2015) of a statistical dialogue manager were ran-
domly sampled and shown to workers recruited
via the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service.
Workers were shown each dialogue turn by turn
and asked to enter an appropriate system response
in natural English corresponding to each system
DA. For each domain around 5K system utter-
ances were collected from about 1K randomly
sampled dialogues. Each categorical value was re-
placed by a token representing its slot, and slots
that appeared multiple times in a DA were merged
into one. After processing and grouping each ut-
terance according to its delexicalised DA, we ob-
tained 248 distinct DAs in the restaurant domain

and 164 in the hotel domain. The average number
of slots per DA for each domain is 2.25 and 1.95,
respectively.

The system was implemented using the Theano
library (Bergstra et al., 2010; Bastien et al., 2012),
and trained by partitioning each of the collected
corpus into a training, validation, and testing set
in the ratio 3:1:1. The frequency of each ac-
tion type and slot-value pair differs quite markedly
across the corpus, hence up-sampling was used to
make the corpus more uniform. Since our gener-
ator works stochastically and the trained networks
can differ depending on the initialisation, all the
results shown below3 were averaged over 5 ran-
domly initialised networks. For each DA, we over-
generated 20 utterances and selected the top 5 real-
isations after reranking. The BLEU-4 metric was
used for the objective evaluation (Papineni et al.,
2002). Multiple references for each test DA were
obtained by mapping them back to the distinct
set of DAs, grouping those delexicalised surface
forms that have the same DA specification, and
then lexicalising those surface forms back to ut-
terances. In addition, the slot error rate (ERR) as
described in Section 3.5 was computed as an aux-
iliary metric alongside the BLEU score. However,
for the experiments it is computed at the corpus
level, by averaging slot errors over each of the top
5 realisations in the entire corpus. The trade-off
weights α between keyword and key phrase detec-
tors as mentioned in Section 3.1 and 3.2 were set
to 0.5.

4.2 Objective Evaluation

trolled LSTM (sc-lstm) and a deep version with

works was used.

two hidden layers (+deep) against several base-
lines: the handcrafted generator (hdc), k-nearest
neighbour (kNN), class-based LMs (classlm) as
proposed in Oh and Rudnicky (2000), the heuris-
tic gated RNN as described in Wen et al. (2015)
and a similar LSTM variant (rnn w/ & lstm w/),
and the same RNN/LSTM but without gates (rnn
w/o & lstm w/o). The handcrafted generator was
developed over a long period of time and is the
standard generator used for trialling end-to-end di-
alogue systems (for example (Gašić et al., 2014)).
The kNN was implemented by computing the sim-
ilarity of the test DA 1-hot vector against all of
the training DA 1-hot vectors, selecting the nearest
and then lexicalising to generate the final surface
form. The objective results are shown in Table
2. As can be seen, none of the baseline systems
shown in the first block (hdc, kNN, & classlm)
are comparable to the systems described in this
paper (sc-lstm & +deep) if both metrics are con-
sidered. Setting aside the difficulty of scaling to
large domains, the handcrafted generator’s (hdc)
use of predefined rules yields a fixed set of sen-
tence plans, which can differ markedly from the
real colloquial human responses collected from
AMT, while the class LM approach suffers from
inaccurate rendering of information. Although
the kNN method provides reasonable adequacy i.e.
low ERR, the BLEU is low, probably because of
the errors in the collected corpus which kNN can-
not handle but statistical approaches such as LMs
can by suppressing unlikely outputs.

The last three blocks in Table 2 compares the
proposed method with previous RNN approaches.

LSTM generally works better than vanilla RNN
due to its ability to model long range dependen-
cies more efficiently. We also found that by us-
ing gates, whether learned or heuristic, gave much
lower slot error rates. As an aside, the ability of
the SC-LSTM to learn gates is also exemplified in
Figure 3. Finally, by combining the learned gate
approach with the deep architecture (+deep), we
obtained the best overall performance.

4.3 Human Evaluation

Since automatic metrics may not consistently
agree with human perception (Stent et al., 2005),
human testing is needed to assess subjective qual-
ity. To do this, a set of judges were recruited using
AMT. For each task, two systems among the four
(classlm, rnn w/, sc-lstm, and +deep) were ran-
domly selected to generate utterances from a set of
newly sampled dialogues in the restaurant domain.
In order to evaluate system performance in the
presence of language variation, each system gen-
erated 5 different surface realisations for each in-
put DA and the human judges were asked to score
each of them in terms of informativeness and nat-
uralness (rating out of 3), and also asked to state a
preference between the two. Here informativeness

is defined as whether the utterance contains all the
information specified in the DA, and naturalness
is defined as whether the utterance could plausibly
have been produced by a human. In order to de-
crease the amount of information presented to the
judges, utterances that appeared identically in both
systems were filtered out. We tested 1000 DAs in
total, and after filtering there were approximately
1300 generated utterances per system.

Table 3 shows the quality assessments which
exhibit the same general trend as the objective re-
sults. The SC-LSTM systems (sc-lstm & +deep)
outperform the class-based LMs (classlm) and the
RNN with heuristic gates (rnn w/) in both metrics.
The deep SC-LSTM system (+deep) is signifi-
cantly better than the class LMs (classlm) in terms
of informativeness, and better than the RNN with
heuristic gates (rnn w/) in terms of naturalness.
The preference test results are shown in Table 4.
Again, the SC-LSTM systems (sc-lstm & +deep)
were significantly preferred by the judges. More-
over, the judges recorded a strong preference for

the deep approach (+deep) compared to the others,
though the preference is not significant when com-
paring to its shallow counterpart (sc-lstm). Exam-
ple dialogue acts and their top-5 realisations are
shown in Table 5.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper we have proposed a neural network-
based generator that is capable of generating natu-
ral linguistically varied responses based on a deep,
semantically controlled LSTM architecture which
we call SC-LSTM. The generator can be trained
on unaligned data by jointly optimising its sen-
tence planning and surface realisation components
using a simple cross entropy criterion without any
heuristics or handcrafting. We found that the SC-
LSTM model achieved the best overall perfor-
mance on two objective metrics across two differ-
ent domains. An evaluation by human judges also
confirmed that the SC-LSTM approach is strongly
preferred to a variety of existing methods.

This work represents a line of research that tries

to model the NLG problem in a unified architec-
ture, whereby the entire model is end-to-end train-
able from data. We contend that this approach can
produce more natural responses which are more
similar to colloquial styles found in human conver-
sations. Another key potential advantage of neu-
ral network based language processing is the im-
plicit use of distributed representations for words
and a single compact parameter encoding of the
information to be conveyed. This suggests that it
should be possible to further condition the gener-
ator on some dialogue features such discourse in-
formation or social cues during the conversation.
Furthermore, adopting a corpus based regime en-
ables domain scalability and multilingual NLG to
be achieved with less cost and a shorter lifecycle.
These latter aspects will be the focus of our future
work in this area.
