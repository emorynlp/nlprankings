Abstract

There has been substantial progress in sum-
marization research enabled by the availabil-
ity of novel, often large-scale, datasets and
recent advances on neural network-based ap-
proaches. However, manual evaluation of the
system generated summaries is inconsistent
due to the difficulty the task poses to hu-
man non-expert readers. To address this is-
sue, we propose a novel approach for manual
evaluation, HIGHlight-based Reference-less
Evaluation of Summarization (HIGHRES), in
which summaries are assessed by multiple an-
notators against the source document via man-
ually highlighted salient content in the latter.
Thus summary assessment on the source doc-
ument by human judges is facilitated, while
the highlights can be used for evaluating mul-
tiple systems. To validate our approach we
employ crowd-workers to augment with high-
lights a recently proposed dataset and com-
pare two state-of-the-art systems. We demon-
strate that HIGHRES improves inter-annotator
agreement in comparison to using the source
document directly, while they help emphasize
differences among systems that would be ig-
nored under other evaluation approaches.1

1 Introduction

Research in automatic summarization has made
headway over the years with single document
summarization as the front-runner due to the avail-
ability of large datasets (Sandhaus, 2008; Her-
mann et al., 2015; Narayan et al., 2018b) which
has enabled the development of novel methods,
many of them employing recent advances in neural
networks (See et al., 2017; Narayan et al., 2018c;
Pasunuru and Bansal, 2018, inter alia).

highlighted source document (top) presented with a
heat map marking the salient content in the document;
the darker the colour, the more annotators deemed the
highlighted text salient.

Measuring progress in summarization is diffi-
cult, as the task has as input a source document
consisting of multiple sentences and methods need
to generate a shorter text that expresses the salient
information of the source fluently and succinctly.
Thus there can be multiple equally good sum-
maries for the same source document as not all
salient information can fit in a given summary
length, while even extractive methods that select
complete sentences are not guaranteed to produce
a coherent summary overall.

The most consistently used evaluation approach
is comparison of the summaries produces against
reference summaries via automatic measures such
as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and its variants. However,

automatic measures are unlikely to be sufficient to
measure performance in summarization (Schluter,
2017), also known for other tasks in which the goal
is to generate natural language (Novikova et al.,
2017). Furthermore, the datasets typically consid-
ered have a single reference summary, as obtaining
multiple ones increases dataset creation cost, thus
evaluation against them is likely to exhibit refer-
ence bias (Louis and Nenkova, 2013; Fomicheva
and Specia, 2016), penalizing summaries contain-
ing salient content different from the reference.

For the above reasons manual evaluation is con-
sidered necessary for measuring progress in sum-
marization. However, the intrinsic difficulty of the
task has led to research without manual evaluation
or only fluency being assessed manually. Those
that conduct manual assessment of the content,
typically use a single reference summary, either
directly (Celikyilmaz et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2017)
or through questions (Narayan et al., 2018b,c) and
thus are also likely to exhibit reference bias.

In this paper we propose a novel approach for
manual evaluation, HIGHlight-based Reference-
less Evaluation of document Summarization
(HIGHRES), in which a summary is assessed
against the source document via manually high-
lighted salient content in the latter (see Figure 1
for an example). Our approach avoids reference
bias, as the multiple highlights obtained help con-
sider more content than what is contained in a sin-
gle reference. The highlights are not dependent
on the summaries being evaluated but only on the
source documents, thus they are reusable across
studies, and they can be crowd-sourced more ef-
fectively than actual summaries. Furthermore, we
propose to evaluate the clarity of a summary sep-
arately from its fluency, as they are different di-
mensions. Finally, HIGHRES provides absolute
instead of ranked evaluation, thus the assessment
of a system can be conducted and interpreted with-
out reference to other systems.

To validate our proposed approach we use
the recently introduced eXtreme SUMmarization
dataset (XSUM, Narayan et al., 2018b) to evalu-
ate two state-of-the-art abstractive summarization
methods, Pointer Generator Networks (See et al.,
2017) and Topic-aware Convolutional Networks
(Narayan et al., 2018b), using crowd-sourcing for
both highlight annotation and quality judgments.

We demonstrate that HIGHRES improves inter-
annotator agreement in comparison to using the

source document directly, while they help empha-
size differences among systems that would be ig-
nored under other evaluation approaches, includ-
ing reference-based evaluation. Furthermore, we
show that the clarity metric from the DUC (Dang,
2005) must be measured separately from “flu-
ency”, as judgments for them had low correlation.
Finally, we make the highlighted XSUM dataset,
codebase to replicate the crowd-sourcing exper-
iments and all other materials produced in our
study publicly available.

2 Literature Review

In recent years, summarization literature has in-
vestigated different means of conducting manual
evaluation. We study a sample of 26 recent pa-
pers from major ACL conferences and outline the
trends of manual evaluation in summarization in
Table 1. From 26 papers, 11 papers (e.g., See
et al., 2017; Kedzie et al., 2018; Cao et al., 2018)
did not conduct any manual evaluation. Following
the Document Understanding Conference (DUC,
Dang, 2005), a majority of work has focused on
evaluating the content and the linguistic quality
of summaries (Nenkova, 2005). However, there
seems to be a lack of consensus on how a summary
should be evaluated: (i) Should it be evaluated rel-
ative to other summaries or standalone in absolute
terms? and (ii) What would be a good source of
comparison: the input document or the reference
summary? The disagreements on these issues re-
sult in authors evaluating their summaries often
(11 out of 26 papers) using automatic measures
such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) despite of its limita-
tions (Schluter, 2017). In what follows, we discuss
previously proposed approaches along three axes:
evaluation metrics, relative vs. absolute, and the
choice of reference.

Evaluation Metrics Despite differences in the
exact definitions, the majority (e.g., Hsu et al.,
2018; Celikyilmaz et al., 2018; Narayan et al.,
2018b; Chen and Bansal, 2018; Peyrard and
Gurevych, 2018) agree on both or either one of
two broad quality definitions: coverage deter-
mines how much of the salient content of the
source document is captured in the summary, and
informativeness, how much of the content cap-
tured in the summary is salient with regards to
the original document. These measures corre-
spond to “recall” and “precision” metrics respec-
tively in Table 1, notions that are commonly used

Table 1: Overview of manual evaluations conducted in recent summarization systems. We categorize them in
four dimensions: the first columns presents papers that do not report on human evaluation; the second column
identifies matrices used for evaluating content (“Pyramid”, “QA”, “Correctness”, “Recall” and “Precision”) and
quality (“Clarity”, “Fluency”) of summaries; the third column focuses if the system ranking reported by humans
on content evaluation were “Absolute” or “Relative”; and finally, the fourth column evaluates if summaries were
evaluated against the input document (“With Document”), the reference summary (“With Reference”) or both (“With
Ref. & Doc.”).

in information retrieval and information extrac-
tion literature. Clarke and Lapata (2010) pro-
posed a question-answering based approach to im-
prove the agreement among human evaluations for
the quality of summary content, which was re-
cently employed by Narayan et al. (2018b) and
Narayan et al. (2018c) (QA in Table 1). In this ap-
proach, questions were created first from the ref-
erence summary and then the system summaries
were judged with regards to whether they en-
abled humans to answer those questions correctly.
ShafieiBavani et al. (2018), on the other hand,
used the “Pyramid” method (Nenkova and Passon-
neau, 2004) which requires summaries to be anno-
tated by experts for salient information. A simi-
lar evaluation approach is the factoids analysis by
Teufel and Van Halteren (2004) which evaluates
the system summary against factoids, a represen-

tation based on atomic units of information, that
are extracted from multiple gold summaries. How-
ever, as in the case of the “Pyramid” method, ex-
tracting factoids requires experts annotators. Fi-
nally, a small number of work evaluates the ”Cor-
rectness” (Chen and Bansal, 2018; Li et al., 2018b;
Chen and Bansal, 2018) of the summary, similar to
fact checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014), which
can be a challenging task in its own right.

The linguistic quality of a summary encom-
passes many different qualities such as fluency,
grammatically, readability, formatting, naturalness
and coherence. Most recent work uses a single hu-
man judgment to capture all linguistic qualities of
the summary (Hsu et al., 2018; Kryściński et al.,
2018; Narayan et al., 2018b; Song et al., 2018;
Guo et al., 2018); we group them under “Fluency”
in Table 1 with an exception of “Clarity” which



3384

was evaluated in the DUC evaluation campaigns
(Dang, 2005). The “Clarity” metric puts emphasis
in easy identification of noun and pronoun phrases
in the summary which is a different dimension
than “Fluency”, as a summary may be fluent but
difficult to be understood due to poor clarity.

Absolute vs Relative Summary Ranking. In
relative assessment of summarization, annotators
are shown two or more summaries and are asked
to rank them according to the dimension at ques-
tion (Yang et al., 2017; Chen and Bansal, 2018;
Narayan et al., 2018a; Guo et al., 2018; Krishna
and Srinivasan, 2018). The relative assessment
is often done using the paired comparison (Thur-
stone, 1994) or the best-worst scaling (Woodworth
and G, 1991; Louviere et al., 2015), to improve
inter-annotator agreement. On the other hand,
absolute assessment of summarization (Li et al.,
2018b; Song et al., 2018; Kryściński et al., 2018;
Hsu et al., 2018; Hardy and Vlachos, 2018) is
often done using the Likert rating scale (Likert,
1932) where a summary is assessed on a numeri-
cal scale. Absolute assessment was also employed
in combination with the question answering ap-
proach for content evaluation (Narayan et al.,
2018b; Mendes et al., 2019). Both approaches,
relative ranking and absolute assessment, have
been investigated extensively in Machine Trans-
lation (Bojar et al., 2016, 2017). Absolute assess-
ment correlates highly with the relative assessment
without the bias introduced by having a simulta-
neous assessment of several models (Bojar et al.,
2011).

Choice of Reference. The most convenient way
to evaluate a system summary is to assess it against
the reference summary (Celikyilmaz et al., 2018;
Yang et al., 2017; Peyrard and Gurevych, 2018),
as this typically requires less effort than reading
the source document. The question answering ap-
proach of Narayan et al. (2018b,c) also falls in
this category, as the questions were written using
the reference summary. However, summarization
datasets are limited to a single reference summary
per document (Sandhaus, 2008; Hermann et al.,
2015; Grusky et al., 2018; Narayan et al., 2018b)
thus evaluations using them is prone to reference
bias (Louis and Nenkova, 2013), also a known is-
sue in machine translation evaluation (Fomicheva
and Specia, 2016). A circumvention for this issue
is to evaluate it against the source document (Song

et al., 2018; Narayan et al., 2018a; Hsu et al., 2018;
Kryściński et al., 2018), asking judges to assess
the summary after reading the source document.
However this requires more effort and is known
to lead to low inter-annotator agreement (Nenkova
and Passonneau, 2004).

3 HIGHRES

Our novel highlight-based reference-less evalu-
ation does not suffer from reference bias as a
summary is assessed against the source document
with manually highlighted salient content. These
highlights are crowd-sourced effectively without
the need of expert annotators as required by the
Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004)
or to generate reference summaries. Our ap-
proach improves over the “Correctness” or “Flu-
ency” only measure for summarization by taking
salience into account. Finally, the assessment of
summaries against the document with highlighted
pertinent content facilitates an absolute evalua-
tion of summaries with high inter-annotator agree-
ment.

Our evaluation framework comprises three
main components: document highlight annotation,
highlight-based content evaluation, and clarity and
fluency evaluation. The second component, which
evaluates the notions of “Precision” and “Recall”
requires the highlights from the first one to be con-
ducted. However, the highlight annotation needs
to happen only once per document, and it can be
reused to evaluate many system summaries, un-
like the Pyramid approach (Nenkova and Passon-
neau, 2004) that requires additional expert annota-
tion for every system summary being evaluated.
The third component is independent of the oth-
ers and can be run in isolation. In all compo-
nents we employ crowd-workers as human judges,
and implement appropriate sanity checking mech-
anisms to ensure good quality judgements. Fi-
nally, we present an extended version of ROUGE
(Lin, 2004) that utilizes the highlights to evalu-
ate system summaries against the document; this
demonstrates another use of the highlights for
summarization evaluation.

3.1 Highlight Annotation

In this part, we ask human judges to read the
source document and then highlight words or
phrases that are considered salient. Each judge is
allowed to highlight parts of the text at any granu-



3385

larity, from single words to complete sentences or
even paragraphs. However we enforce a limit in
the number of words to K that can be highlighted
in total by a judge in a document, correspond-
ing to the length of the summary expected. By
employing multiple judges per document who are
restricted in the amount of text that can be high-
lighted we expect to have a more diverse and fo-
cused highlight from multiple judges which cover
different viewpoints of the article. To ensure that
each highlight is reliable, we performed a sanity
check at the end of the task where we ask the
judges to answer a True/False question based on
the article. We rejected all annotations that failed
to correctly answer the sanity check question.

3.2 Highlight-based Content Evaluation
In this component, we present human judges a
document that has been highlighted using heatmap
coloring and a summary to assess. We ask our
judges to assess the summary for (i) ‘All important
information is present in the summary’ and (ii)
‘Only important information is in the summary.’
The first one is the recall (content coverage) mea-
sure and the second, the precision (informative-
ness) measure. All the ratings were collected on a
1-100 Likert scale (Likert, 1932). Figure 2 shows
the content evaluation user interface where salient
parts of the document are highlighted. As with the
highlight annotation, we performed the same form
of sanity check to the one in the highlight annota-
tion task.

3.3 Clarity and Fluency Evaluation
In this part, we give the judges only the summary
and ask them to rate it on clarity and fluency. For
clarity, each judge is asked whether the summary
is easy to be understood, i.e. there should be no
difficulties in identifying the referents of the noun
phrases (every noun/place/event should be well-
specified) or understanding the meaning of the
sentence. For fluency, each judge is asked whether
the summary sounds natural and has no grammat-
ical problems. While fluency is often evaluated in
recent work, clarity, while first introduced in DUC
evaluations, has recently been ignored in manual
evaluation, despite that it captures a different di-
mension of summarization quality.

To ensure that the judgments for clarity and
fluency are not affected by each other (poor flu-
ency can affect clarity, but a summary can have
perfect fluency but low clarity), we evaluate each

metric separately. We ask the judges to evaluate
multiple summaries per task with each dimension
in its own screen. For sanity checking, we in-
sert three artificial summaries of different quality
(good, mediocre and bad summaries). The good
summary is the unedited one, while the others are
generated from sentences randomly sampled from
the source document. For the mediocre summary,
some words are edited to introduce some gram-
matical or syntactic errors while for the bad sum-
mary, the words are further scrambled. We reject
judgements that failed to pass this criteria: bad <
mediocre < good.

3.4 Highlight-based ROUGE Evaluation

Our Highlight-based ROUGE (we refer to it as
HROUGE) formulation is similar to the origi-
nal ROUGE with the difference that the n-grams
are weighted by the number of times they were
highlighted. One benefit of HROUGE is that it
introduces saliency into the calculation without
being reference-based as in ROUGE. Implicitly
HROUGE considers multiple summaries as the
highlights are obtained from multiple workers.

Given a document D as a sequence of m tokens
{w1, . . . , wm}, annotated with N highlights, we
define the weight βng ∈ [0, 1] for an n-gram g as:

βng =

m−(n−1)∑
i=1

[∑i+n−1
j=i

NumH(wj)
N

n

]
wi:i+n−1==g

m−(n−1)∑
i=1

[1]wi:i+n−1==g

where, [x]y is an indicator function which returns
x if y is true and 0, otherwise. NumH(wj) =∑N

k=1
len(Hk)
K [1]wj∈Hk is a function which returns

the number of times word wj is highlighted by the
annotators out of N times weighted by the lengths
of their highlights; Hk is the highlighted text by
the k-th annotator and K is the maximum allowed
length of the highlighted text (see Section 3.1).
NumH(wj) gives less importance to annotators
with highlights with few words. In principle, if an
n-gram is highlighted by every crowd-worker and
the length of the highlight of each crowd-worker
is K, the n-gram g will have a maximum weight
of βng = 1.

The HROUGE scores for a summary S can then

be defined as:

HRnrec =

∑
g∈n -gram(S)

βng count(g,D ∩ S)∑
g∈n -gram(D)

βng count(g,D)

HRnpre =

∑
g∈n -gram(S)

βng count(g,D ∩ S)∑
g∈n -gram(S)

count(g,S)

HRnrec and HR
n
pre are the HROUGE recall and pre-

cision scores; count(g,X ) is the maximum num-
ber of n-gram g occurring in the text X . The
weight in the denominator of HRnpre is uniform
(βng = 1) for all g because if we weighted accord-
ing to the highlights, words in the summary that
are not highlighted in the original document would
be ignored. This would result in HRnpre not pe-
nalizing summaries for containing words that are
likely to be irrelevant as they do not appear in the
highlights of the document. It is important to note
HROUGE has an important limitation in that it
penalizes abstractive summaries that do not reuse
words from the original document. This is similar
to ROUGE penalizing summaries for not reusing
words from the reference summaries, however the
highlights allow us to implicitly consider multiple

references without having to actually obtain them.

4 Summarization Dataset and Models

We use the extreme summarization dataset
(XSUM, Narayan et al., 2018b)2 which com-
prises BBC articles paired with their single-
sentence summaries, provided by the journalists
writing the articles. The summary in the XSUM
dataset demonstrates a larger number of novel n-
grams compared to other popular datasets such
as CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) or NY
Times (Sandhaus, 2008) as such it is suitable to be
used for our experiment since the more abstractive
nature of the summary renders automatic methods
such as ROUGE less accurate as they rely on string
matching, and thus calls for human evaluation for
more accurate system comparisons. Following
Narayan et al. (2018b), we didn’t use the whole
test set portion, but sampled 50 articles from it for
our highlight-based evaluation.

We assessed summaries from two state-of-
the-art abstractive summarization systems using
our highlight-based evaluation: (i) the Pointer-
Generator model (PTGEN) introduced by See
et al. (2017) is an RNN-based abstractive systems
which allows to copy words from the source text,

3387

and (ii) the Topic-aware Convolutional Sequence
to Sequence model (TCONVS2S) introduced by
Narayan et al. (2018b) is an abstractive model
which is conditioned on the article’s topics and
based entirely on Convolutional Neural Networks.
We used the pre-trained models3 provided by the
authors to obtain summaries from both systems for
the documents in our test set.

5 Experiments and Results

All of our experiments are done using the Amazon
Mechanical Turk platform.We develop three types
of Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs): highlight an-
notation, highlight-based content evaluation, and
fluency and clarity evaluation. In addition, we
elicited human judgments for content evaluation
in two more ways: we assessed system summaries
against the original document (without highlights)
and against the reference summary. The latter two
experiments are intended as the comparison for
our proposed highlight-based content evaluation.

5.1 Highlight Annotation
We collected highlight annotations from 10 differ-
ent participants for each of 50 articles. For each
annotation, we set K, the maximum number of
words to highlight, to 30. Our choice reflects the
average length (24 words) of reference summaries
in the XSUM dataset. To facilitate the annotation
of BBC news articles with highlights, we asked
our participants to adapt the 5W1H (Who, What,
When, Where, Why and How) principle (Robert-
son, 1946) that is a common practice in journal-
ism. The participants however were not obliged
to follow this principle and were free to highlight
content as they deem fit.

The resulting annotation exhibits a substantial
amount of variance, confirming the intuition that
different participants are not expected to agree en-
tirely on what is salient in a document. On aver-
age, the union of the highlights from 10 annota-
tors covered 38.21% per article and 33.77% of the
highlights occurred at the second half of the arti-
cle. This shows that the judges did not focus only
on the beginning of the documents but annotated
all across the document.

Using Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss, 1971) on the binary
labels provided by each judge on each word (high-
lighted or not) we obtained an average agreement

3Both models were trained using the standard cross-
entropy loss to maximize the likelihood of the reference sum-
mary given the document.

of 0.19 for the 50 articles considered. The low
agreement score does not indicate a poor annota-
tion process necessarily; we argue that this is pri-
marily due to the annotators having different opin-
ions on which parts of an article are salient. The
article with the highest agreement (0.32) has more
focused highlights, whereas the article with the
lowest agreement (0.04) has highlights spread all
over (both articles can be seen in the supplemen-
tary materials). Interestingly, the reference sum-
mary on the highest agreement article appears to
be more informative of its content when the an-
notator agreement is high; the reference summary
on the lowest agreement article is more indica-
tive, i.e., it does not contain any informative con-
tent from the article but only to inform the reader
about the article’s topic and scope. These results
confirm that the annotation behaviour originates
from the nature of the document and the summary
it requires, and validates our highlight annotation
setup.

5.2 Content Evaluation of Summaries

We assessed the summaries against (i) docu-
ments with highlights (Highlight-based), (ii) origi-
nal documents without highlights (Non Highlight-
based) and (iii) reference summaries (Reference-
based). For each setup, we collected judgments
from 3 different participants for each model sum-
mary. Table 2 and 3 presents our results.

Both the highlight-based and non-highlight
based assessment of summaries agree on the
ranking among TCONVS2S, PTGEN and Ref-
erence. Perhaps unsurprisingly human-authored

summaries were considered best, whereas,
TCONVS2S was ranked 2nd, followed by PT-
GEN. However, the performance difference in
TCONVS2S and PTGEN is greatly amplified
when they are evaluated against document with
highlights (6.48 and 5.54 Precision and Recall
points) compared to when evaluated against the
original documents (3.98 and 1.83 Precision
and Recall points). The performance difference
is lowest when they are evaluated against the
reference summary (2.51 and -1.79 Precision and
Recall points). The superiority of TCONVS2S
is expected; TCONVS2S is better than PTGEN
for recognizing pertinent content and generating
informative summaries due to its ability to rep-
resent high-level document knowledge in terms
of topics and long-range dependencies (Narayan
et al., 2018b).

We further measured the agreement among the
judges using the coefficient of variation (Everitt,
2006) from the aggregated results. It is defined
as the ratio between the sample standard devia-
tion and sample mean. It is a scale-free met-
ric, i.e. its results are comparable across measure-
ments of different magnitude. Since, our sample
size is small (3 judgements per summary), we use
the unbiased version (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995) as
cv = (1+ 14n)

σ
x̄ , where σ is the standard deviation,

n is the number of sample, and x̄ is the mean.

We found that the highlight-based assessment
in general has lower variation among judges than
the non-highlight based or reference-based assess-
ment. The assessment of TCONVS2S summaries
achieves 0.67 and 0.80 of Precision and Recall
cv points which are 0.08 and 0.03 points below
when they are assessed against documents with
no highlights, respectively. We see a similar pat-
tern in Recall on the assessment of PTGEN sum-
maries. Our results demonstrate that the highlight-
based assessment of abstractive systems improve
agreement among judges compared to when they
are assessed against the documents without high-
lights or the reference summaries. The assessment
of human-authored summaries does not seem to
follow this trend, we report a mixed results (0.49
vs 0.48 for precision and 0.63 vs 0.67 for recall)
when they are evaluated with and without the high-
lights.

5.3 Clarity and Fluency Evaluation
Table 4 shows the results of our fluency and clarity
evaluations. Similar to our highlight-based con-
tent evaluation, human-authored summaries were
considered best, whereas TCONVS2S was ranked
2nd followed by PTGEN, on both measures. The
Pearson correlation between fluency and clarity
evaluation is 0.68 which shows a weak correla-
tion; it confirms our hypothesis that the ”clarity”
captures different aspects from ”fluency” and they
should not be combined as it is commonly done.

5.4 Highlight-based ROUGE Evaluation
Table 5 presents our HROUGE results assessing
TCONVS2S , PTGEN and Reference summaries
with the highlights. To compare, we also re-
port ROUGE results assessing these summaries
against the original document without highlights.
In the latter case, HROUGE becomes the standard
ROUGE metric with βng = 1 for all n-grams g.

Both ROUGE and HROUGE favour method of
copying content from the original document and
penalizes abstractive methods, thus it is not sur-
prising that PTGEN is superior to TCONVS2S, as
the former has an explicit copy mechanism. The
fact that PTGEN is better in terms of HROUGE
is also an evidence that the copying done by PT-
GEN selects salient content, thus confirming that
the copying mechanism works as intended. When
comparing the reference summaries against the
original documents, both ROUGE and HROUGE
confirm that the reference summaries are rather

abstractive as reported by Narayan et al. (2018b),
and they in fact score below the system sum-
maries. Recall scores are very low in all cases
which is expected, since the 10 highlights obtained
per document or the documents themselves, taken
together, are much longer than any of the sum-
maries.

6 Qualitative Analysis

HIGHRES eliminates reference bias. The ex-
ample presented in Figure 3 demonstrates how
our highlight-based evaluation eliminates refer-
ence bias in summarization evaluation. The sum-
maries generated by TCONVS2S and PTGEN are
able to capture the essence of the document, how-
ever, there are phrases in these summaries that do
not occur in the reference summary. A reference-
based evaluation would fail to give a reasonable
score to these system summaries. The HIGHRES
however, would enable the judges to better evalu-
ate the summaries without any reference bias.

Fluency vs Clarity. Example in Table 6 shows
disagreements between fluency and clarity scores
for different summaries of the same article. From
the example, we can see that the TCONVS2S
summary is fluent but is not easily understood in
the context of ‘the duration of resignation’, while
the PTGEN summary has word duplication which
lower the fluency and also lacking clarity due to
several unclear words.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper we introduced the HIGHlight-
based Reference-less Evaluation Summarization
(HIGHRES) framework for manual evaluation.
The proposed framework avoids reference bias
and provides absolute instead of ranked evalua-
tion of the systems. Our experiments show that
HIGHRES lowers the variability of the judges’
content assessment, while helping expose the dif-
ferences between systems. We also showed that
by evaluating clarity we are able to capture a dif-
ferent dimension of summarization quality that is
not captured by the commonly used fluency. We
believe that our highlight-based evaluation is an
ideal setup of abstractive summarization for three
reasons: (i) highlights can be crowd sourced ef-
fectively without expert annotations, (ii) it avoids
reference bias and (iii) it is not limited by n-gram
overlap. In future work, we would like to extend
our framework to other variants of summariza-
tion e.g. multi-document. Also, we will explore
ways of automating parts of the process, e.g. the
highlight annotation. Finally, the highlights could
also be used as training signal, as it offers content
saliency information at a finer level than the single
reference typically used.
