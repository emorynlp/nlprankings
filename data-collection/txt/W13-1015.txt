1 Introduction and Background

One of the crucial issues in the analysis and process-
ing of MWEs is their internal variability. Indeed,
the feature that mostly characterises MWEs is their
fixedness at some level of linguistic analysis, be it
morphology, syntax, or semantics. The morphologi-
cal aspect is not trivial in languages which exhibit a
rich morphology, such as Romance languages.

The issue is relevant in at least three aspects of
MWE representation and processing: lexicons, iden-
tification, and extraction (Calzolari et al., 2002). At
the lexicon level, MWEs are usual stored as one
form only, the so-called quotation form (or citation
form). However, some variations of the quotation
form might also be valid instances of MWEs (Bond
et al., 2005) — some but not all, as some of them
might actually be plain compositional phrases.

This becomes relevant for automatic identification
and extraction. If a lexicon stores the quotation form
only, identification on a corpus done via matching
lexicon strings as such would miss valid variations
of a given MWE. Identification could be done ex-
ploiting lemmas rather than quotation forms, but an
unrestricted match would also possibly return com-
positional phrases. Extraction is usually done ap-
plying association measures over instances of given
POS patterns (Evert and Krenn, 2005), and because
lemmas are matched, no restrictions on internal vari-
ation is enforced as such. Knowing which variations
should be allowed for the quotation form of a given
MWE would help in increasing recall while keeping
precision high. However, specifying such variations
for each MWE would be too costly and wouldn’t

help in extraction, as no specifications could be done
a priori on yet unknown MWEs. Optimally, one
would need to find more general variation patterns
that could be applied to classes of MWEs. Indeed,
the main idea behind this work is that MWEs can
be handled through more general patterns. This is
also claimed, for instance, by Masini (2007) whose
analysis on Italian MWEs takes a constructionist
perspective (Goldberg, 2003), by Weller and Heid
(2010), who treat verbal expressions in German, and
also by Grégoire (2010), who bases his work on the
Equivalence Class Method (ECM, (Odijk, 2004)) as-
suming that MWEs may be clustered according to
their syntactic pattern and treated homogeneously.
We suggest that variation patterns can be found and
defined over POS sequences. Working on Italian, in
this paper we report the results of ongoing research
and show how such patterns can be derived, we then
propose a way to encode them in a repository, which
can be combined with existing lexicons of MWEs.
For the moment, we restrict our study to contiguous
MWEs although we are aware that non-contiguous
expressions are common and should be treated, too
(see also (Pianta and Bentivogli, 2004)). Thus, only
morphological variation is considered at this stage,
while phenomena such as insertion and word order
variation are left for future work.

2 Obtaining Variation Patterns

Variation patterns refer to POS sequences and rely
on frequencies. The main resources needed for ob-
taining them are a MWE lexicon and a reference cor-
pus (pos-tagged and lemmatised).We use a MWE
lexicon derived from an existing online dictionary

101



for Italian (Zaninello and Nissim, 2010), and the
corpus “La Repubblica” (Baroni et al., 2004) for ob-
taining frequencies.

A variation pattern encodes the way a given in-
stance of a MWE morphologically differs from its
original quotation form in each of its parts. All
tokens that correspond to the quotation form are
marked as fix whereas all tokens that do not are
marked as flex. Consider Example (1):

(1) a. quotation form: “casa di cura” (nursing
home)

b. instance: “case di cura” (nursing homes)
c. variation pattern: flex fix fix

The pattern for the instance in (1b) is flex fix fix
because the first token, “case” (houses) is a plu-
ral whereas the quotation form features a singu-
lar (“casa”, house), thus is assigned a flex label,
whereas the other two tokens are found exactly as
they appear in the quotation form, and are therefore
labelled as fix.

At this point, it is quite important to note that a
binary feature applied to each token makes flexibil-
ity underspecified in at least two ways. First, the
value flex does not account by itself for the degree
of variation: a token is flex if it can be found in one
variation as well as many. We have addressed this is-
sue elsewhere via a dedicated measure (Nissim and
Zaninello, 2011), but we do not pick it up here again.
In any case, the degree of variation could indeed be
included as additional information. Second, we only
specify which part of the MWEs varies but do not
make assumptions on the type of variation encoun-
tered (for example, it doesn’t distinguish at the level
of gender or number).

We believe this is a fair tradeoff which cap-
tures generalisations at a level which is intermedi-
ate between a word-by-word analysis and consider-
ing the entire MWE as a single unit. Additionally, it
does not require finer-grained annotation than POS-
tagging and lemmatisation, and allows for the dis-
covery of possibly unknown and unpredicted varia-
tions. Morphological analysis, when needed, is of
course still possible a posteriori on the instances
found, but it is useful that at this stage flexibility is
left underspecified.

As said, validating variation patterns per MWE
would be impractical and uninformative with respect

to the extraction of previously unseen MWEs. Thus,
we define variation patterns over part-of-speech se-
quences. More specifically, we operate as follows:

1. search all MWEs contained in a given lexicon
on a large corpus, matching all possible varia-
tions (lemma-based, or unconstrained, search);

2. obtain variation patterns for all MWEs by com-
paring each instance to its quotation form;

3. group all MWEs with the same POS sequence;

4. for each POS sequence collect all variation pat-
terns of all pertinent MWEs.

In previous work (Nissim and Zaninello, 2013), we
have observed that frequency is a good indicator
of valid patterns: the most frequent variation pat-
terns correlate with variations annotated as correct
by manual judges. Patterns for two nominal POS
were evaluated, and they were found to be success-
ful. In this paper we pick three further POS se-
quences per expression type for a total of nine POS
patterns, and evaluate the precision of a pattern se-
lection measure.

The availability of variation patterns per POS se-
quences (and expression type) can be of use both in
identification as well as in extraction. In identifica-
tion, patterns can be used as a selection strategy for
all of the matched instances. One could just use fre-
quency directly from the corpus where the identifi-
cation is done, but this might not always be possible
due to corpus size. This is why using an external
repository of patterns evaluated against a large ref-
erence corpus for a given language might be useful.

In extraction tasks, patterns can be used as fil-
ters, either as a post-processing phase after match-
ing lemmas for given POS sequences, or directly
extracting only allowed configurations which could
be specified for instance in extraction tools such as
mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al., 2010). In previous
work we have shown that patterns can be derived
comparing found instances against their lemmatised
form, making this a realistic setting even in extrac-
tion where quotation forms are not known (Nissim
and Zaninello, 2013).

3 Ranking

For ranking variation patterns we take into account
the following figures:

• the total number of different variation patterns
per POS sequence

• the total number of instances (hits on the cor-
pus) with a given variation pattern

For example, the POS sequence ADJ PRE NOUN
characterising some adjectival expressions is fea-
tured by 9 different original multiword expres-
sions that were found in the corpus. The vari-
ations with respect to the quotation form (indi-
cated as fix fix fix and found for seven differ-
ent types) in which instances have been found are
four: flex fix fix (13 times), flex fix flex (7
times), fix fix flex (3 times), and fix flex flex
(one time), for a total of 31 variations. Each in-
stance yielding a given pattern was found at least
once in the corpus, but possibly more times. We take
into account this value as well, thus counting the
number of single instances of a given pattern. So,
while “degni di nota” (“worthpl mentioning”, quota-
tion form: “degno di nota”, “worthsg mentioning”)
would serve as one variation of type flex fix fix,
counting instances would account for the fact that
this expression was found in the corpus 38 times.
For the ADJ PRE NOUN sequence, instances of
pattern fix fix fix were found 130 times, in-
stances of flex fix fix 219, flex fix flex 326,
fix fix flex 90, and fix flex flex just once, for
a total of 766 instances.

Such figures are the basis for pattern ranking and
are used in the repository to contribute to the de-
scription of variation patterns (Figure 1). We use the
share of a given variation pattern (vp) over the total
number of variations (pattern share). In the exam-
ple above, the share of flex fix fix (occurring 13
times) would be 13/31 (41.9%), as 31 is the total
of encountered variations for the ADJ PRE NOUN
POS sequence. We also use the instance share,
which for the same variation pattern would be
219/766 (12.0%) and combine it with the pattern
share to obtain an overall share (sharevp):

sharevp = (
#variationsvp
#variationspos

+
#instancesvp
#instancespos

)/2

As a global ranking score (GRSvp), the resulting av-
erage share is combined with the spread, namely
the ratio of instances over variations (219/13 for
flex fix fix), a pattern-internal measure indicat-
ing the average instances per variation pattern.

spreadvp =
#instancesvp
#variationsvp

GRSvp = sharevp ∗ spreadvp

Only patterns with GRS > 1 are kept, with the aim
of maximising precision. Evaluation is done against
some POS sequences for which extracted instances
have been manually annotated. Precision, recall, and
f-score are reported in Table 1. Results for an un-
constrained search (no pattern selection) are also in-
cluded for comparison. The number of variation pat-
terns that we keep on the basis of the ranking score
includes the fix fix fix pattern.

From the table, we can see that in most cases
precision is increased over an unconstrained match.
However, while for verbal expressions the boost
in precision preserves recall high, thus yielding f-
scores that are always higher than for an uncon-
strained search, the same isn’t true for adjectives
and adverbs. In two cases, both featuring the same
POS sequence (PRE NOUN ADJ) though for dif-
ferent expression types, recall is heavily sacrificed.
In three cases, the GRS doesn’t let discard any pat-
terns, thus being of no use in boosting precision.
These are cases where only two variation patterns
were observed, indicating that possibly other rank-
ing measures could be explored for better results un-
der such conditions. In previous work we have seen
that selecting variation patterns works well for nom-
inal expressions (Nissim and Zaninello, 2013).

Overall, even though in some cases our method
does not yield different results than an unconstrained
search, whenever it does, precision is always higher.
It is therefore worth applying whenever boosting
precision is desirable.

4 Repository and Encoding

We create an XML-based repository of POS patterns
with their respective variation patterns. Variation
patterns per POS sequence are reported according
to the ranking produced by the GRS. However, we

include all observed patterns equipped with the fre-
quency information we used, so that other ranking
measures or different thresholds could be applied.

The repository is intended as connected to two
sources, namely a lexicon to obtain quotation forms
of MWEs to be searched, and the corpus where ex-
pressions were searched, which provides the figures.

POS patterns are listed as elements for each
expression element, whose attribute type spec-
ifies the grammatical type—for example “verbal”.
The same POS pattern can feature under differ-
ent expression types, and could have different con-
straints on variation according to the grammatical
category of the MWE (in extraction this issue would
require dedicated handling, as the grammatical cat-
egory is not necessarily known in advance). For
the element pattern, which specifies the POS se-
quence, the attribute mwes indicates how many dif-
ferent original mews were found for that sequence,
and the attributes variations and instances
the number of variations and instances (Section 3).
Actual patterns are listed as data of a vp (variation
pattern) element, according to decreasing GRS, with
values obtained from the reference corpus (specified
via a corpus element). Attributes for the vp ele-
ment are vshare (variation share), ishare (in-
stance share), spread, and grs (see again Sec-
tion 3). In Figure 1 we provide a snapshot of what
the repository looks like.

The POS sequence of a MWE in the original lex-
icon can be matched to the same value in the repos-
itory, and so can the expression type, which should
also be specified in the lexicon, so that the relative
variation patterns can be inherited by the MWE.
