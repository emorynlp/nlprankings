Abstract 

This work introduces a new approach for 

aspect based sentiment analysis task. Its main 

purpose is to automatically assign the correct 

polarity for the aspect term in a phrase. It is a 

probabilistic automata where each state 

consists of all the nouns, adjectives, verbs and 

adverbs found in an annotated corpora. Each 

one of them contains the number of 

occurrences in the annotated corpora for the 

four required polarities (i.e. positive, negative, 

neutral and conflict). Also, the transitions 

between states have been taken into account. 

These values were used to assign the predicted 

polarity when a pattern was found in a 

sentence; if a pattern cannot be applied, the 

probabilities of the polarities between states 

were computed in order to predict the right 

polarity. The system achieved results around 

66% and 57% of recall for the restaurant and 

laptop domain respectively. 

1 Introduction 

Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a 

vital task from both an academic and a 

commercial standpoint. Textual information has 

become one of the most important sources of data 

to extract useful and heterogeneous knowledge. 

“Texts can provide factual information, such as: 

descriptions, lists of characteristics, or even 

instructions to opinion-based information, which 

would include reviews, emotions, or feelings. 

These facts have motivated dealing with the 

identification and extraction of opinions and 

sentiments in texts that require special attention.” 

(Gutiérrez, et al., 2014). Sentiment Analysis or 

“Subjectivity Analysis” in (Liu, 2010) is defined 

as the computational treatment of opinions, 

sentiments and emotions expressed in a text. In 

order to automatically treat the subjectivity, we 

need lexical resources that allow the detection and 

evaluation of the affective/ subjective charges in 

texts, its polarity and intensity.  

Regarding research carried out for linguistic 

patterns identification and its polarity in texts, it is 

worth mentioning works on: adjectives 

(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) (Wiebe, 

2000); adjectives and verbs (Turney, 2002) 

(Wilson, et al., 2005) (Takamura, et al., 2007); 

and also verbs and names (Esuli and Sebastini, 

2006). WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has also been 

used for the collection of opinion adjectives and 

verbs (Kim and Hovy, 2005) to determine the 

semantic orientation of the terms depending on 

their notes (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), for the 

adjective extraction (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 

2006) or opinion mining (Esuli and Sebastiani, 

2007).  

Inspired on Hidden Markov models (Baum 

and Petrie, 1966) and following the idea that 

words combinations are finite in an evaluation 

text, we decided to create a finite automata in 

graph form to represent all these relations 

extracted from a training corpus. For the creation 

of this automata we utilised different resources, 

such as WordNet and OpinionFinder Subjectivity 

Lexicon. Also, different extracted patterns based 

on (Cazabón, 1973) were applied. 

This paper is structured as follows: In section 

1.1 is described the task 4 of SemEval2014 

(Pontiki, et al., 2014) where this system was 

presented. Section 2 presents the description of 

the automata and how it was built. The polarity 

assignation method using the trained automata is

described in section 3. Finally, in section 4 and 5 

are shown the results and conclusions, 

respectively. 

1.1 Task Description 

The SemEval2014 task 4 (Pontiki, et al., 2014) 

was divided into four subtasks: 4.1 Aspect term 

extraction; 4.2 Aspect term polarity; 4.3 Aspect 

category detection; and 4.4 Aspect category 

polarity. 

This paper is focused on subtask 4.2 which is 

described as follows: 

Given one or more Aspect Terms within a 

sentence, it is necessary to determine whether the 

polarity of each Aspect Term is positive, negative, 

neutral or conflict (i.e., both positive and 

negative). For example: 

“I loved their fajitas” → 
“fajitas”: positive 

“I hated their fajitas, but 

their salads were great” → 
“fajitas”: negative, 

“salads”: positive 

“The fajitas are their first 

plate” → “fajitas”: neutral 
“The fajitas were great to 

taste, but not to see” → 
“fajitas”: conflict. 

Each participant was permitted to submit two 

kinds of runs for this task: 

Constrained: Using only the provided training 
data and other resources, such as lexicons. 

Unconstrained: Using additional data for 
training. Teams were asked to report what 

resources they used for each submitted run. 

The training dataset, provided by the organiser of 

the Task 4 challenge, consists of two domain-

specific datasets which contain over 6,500 

sentences with fine-grained aspect-level human-

authored annotations. These domains are: 

Restaurant reviews: This dataset consists of 

over 3000 English sentences from the restaurant 

reviews of (Ganu, et al., 2009) that were adapted 

to the task. 

Laptop reviews: This dataset consists of over 

3000 English sentences extracted from customer 

reviews of laptops. 

2 The automata 

The automata was represented as a graph 𝐺 =
 (𝑆, 𝑇) whose vertexes constitute the group of 
finite states 𝑆 =  [𝑠1, 𝑠2, 𝑠3, … , 𝑠𝑛] while the 

                                                           
1http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/ 

edges represent the transitions 𝑇 =
 [𝑡1, 𝑡2, 𝑡3, … , 𝑡𝑛] of going from one state to 
another. 

Our finite automata involves the following 

features: 

1. Group of finite states: all the verbs, nouns, 
adverbs, adjectives that were extracted from 

the training dataset (see Section 2.1) using 

Freeling 3.1 language analyser (Atserias, et 

al., 2006), or Aspect Terms (that may be 

formed by several words). In every state the 

automata stores the occurrences 𝑊𝑖
𝑝
, where 

p is one of the following polarity classes: 

positive, negative, neutral, conflict or 

undefined, i being the index of the current 

state in the graph. 

2. Finite alphabet: a sentences set which 
contains one or more Aspect Terms to 

which should be assigned a polarity. 

3. Initial state: first word of the sentence. 

4. Transition state (𝑇𝑠𝑖,𝑗 and 𝑇𝑠𝑗,𝑖): each 

transition between two states contains 𝑊𝑖,𝑗
𝑝

  

and 𝑊𝑗,𝑖
𝑝

, where p is  positive, negative, 

neutral  or conflict, i is the current state, and 

j is the next state. 

5. End state: last word of the sentence. 
If we could not determine the polarity 

classification for a state or transition, then we set 

it as undefined polarity. 

2.1 Training the automata 

In order to create the automata the training dataset 

provided for the SemEval2014 taks 41 was used. 

In the automata, each word of a sentence forms 

a state which is connected to the following word. 

This connection forms a transition between the 

two words. This method is repeated until the last 

word of the sentence is reached. If the word 

already exists in the automata, both its state and 

all the transitions (from and to that word) are 

adjusted, increasing in one the 𝑊𝑖
𝑝
, 𝑊𝑖,𝑗

𝑝
and 𝑊𝑗,𝑖

𝑝
 

of the polarity value initially assigned in the 

corpus.  

The transitions from words to Aspect Terms 

with their respective polarities allow to go through 

those words with undefined polarities to the target 

Aspect Terms. This event is done for finding the 

most probably polarity according to the training 

discoveries. Same thing happens with transitions 

from an Aspect Term to a word, but in this case 

from the polarity of the Aspect Term to undefined 

polarity. 

723



On the other hand, if the word is not an Aspect 

Term its state do not change at all, since the 

dataset only annotates the Aspect Terms, so we do 

not know the polarity of those words that are not 

an Aspect Term. 

To solve this issue we decided to make use of 

other resources to enhance the automata, so that 

the probability for finding a polarity for a word in 

the automata increases with the expansion of the 

dictionary. We used the Opinion Finder 

Subjectivity Lexicon (OFSL) (Wilson, et al., 

2005) to adjust the state and transitions of the 

words in the automata. To address the adjustment, 

for every word of OFSL (according to the 

classification of the sentiment polarity) that exists 

in the graph represented by automata, the 

respective value of polarity of 𝑊𝑖
𝑝

, 𝑊𝑖,𝑗
𝑝

and 𝑊𝑗,𝑖
𝑝

 is 

increased in one. We also used WordNet 3.0 to 

obtain the synonyms and antonyms of the words 

in the automata to form new states and transitions. 

Synonyms were given the same polarity as the 

related word, whereas antonyms took the opposite 

polarity. The subjectivity clues extracted by the 

patterns detected in the training dataset were used 

as well (See section 3.2). 

In Table 1 we show the terminology used for 

the patterns. 
Symbol Description 

[] Optional word 

/! Subjectivity clue 

/l Compare by lemma 

AT Aspect Term 

Table 1: Pattern symbols 

Examples: 
[DT] AT [PRP] [RB] be/l [VBG/!] 

RB/! [JJ/!] [RB/!] 

[RB/!] [DT] JJS/! [DT] [NN] AT [VB] 

[NN/!] 

[DT] JJ/! NN PRP VBD VB [DT] AT 

AT be/l [DT/!] JJ/! [PRP/!] [RB/!] 

Note the use of the POS tags such as DT, NN, 

VBD, and others were taken from the result of the 

pos-tagging process performed by Freeling 3.1. 

Using this tool the incoming texts were split into 

parts (sentences) for the following processes. 

For instance, in the sentence “This MacBook 

Pro is excellent” the subjectivity clue for the 

Aspect Term MacBook Pro is excellent; so its 

states and transitions get adjusted the same way as 

the Aspect Term. Figure 1 describes this example, 

where pi is 𝑊𝑖
𝑝

 , pij is 𝑊𝑖,𝑗
𝑝

and pji is 𝑊𝑗,𝑖
𝑝

 means the 

occurrence for positive polarity (negative, neutral 

and conflict polarities were omitted by lack of 

space). Both states and transitions are represented.

pattern analysis. 

3 Polarity Assignation 

Before predicting the polarity of the Aspect 

Terms, each sentence is divided by its connectors 

(conjunctions, prepositions and adverbs, extracted 

using Freeling), forming the corresponding 

phrases. For instance, the sentence “Where 

Gabriela personally greets you and recommends 

you what to eat” is divided into the phrase “Where 

Gabriela personally greets you” and the phrase 

“recommends you what to eat” by connector and. 

3.1 Selection criteria 

If only one polarity is found then that is the 

polarity for the Aspect Term. On the other hand, 

if more than one polarity is found, the polarity for 

the Aspect Term is the most repeated one.  

Note that if both positive and negative are the 

most repeated polarities we set conflict as the 

polarity for the Aspect Term. 

If no polarities are found at all, we assignee 

neutral to the Aspect Term. 

3.2 Assigning polarity using patterns 

We detected different patterns which allowed us 

to extract those words that influence on the Aspect 

Term polarity in the phrase (See section 2.1). 

For each phrase subjectivity clue i, we 

calculate the most probable polarity 

𝑃𝑝𝑖=𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑝(𝑊𝑖
𝑝

), if i has a state in the automata. 

After that, we apply our selection criteria 

described in section 3.1.  

If no polarities are found at all, we process the 

phrase in the next steps. 

3.3 Assigning polarity using the automata  

For each Aspect Term in the phrase we get the 

sentence it belongs to and we calculate 𝑃𝑡𝑖,𝑗= 
𝑊𝑖,𝑗

𝑝

∑ 𝑊𝑖,𝑗
𝑝  in that sentence, where 𝑃𝑡𝑖,𝑗 is the most 

probable polarity of 𝑇𝑠𝑖,𝑗 (j being the Aspect 

Term), if such a transition existed. If no polarity 

724



is found, then we calculate 𝑃𝑡 𝑗,𝑖=
𝑊𝑗,𝑖

𝑝

∑ 𝑊𝑗,𝑖
𝑝  again if 

such a transition existed. 

In case of applying aforementioned processes 

without finding out a concrete polarity for the 

target Aspect Terms, we perform other steps to try 

to find one or more polarities for the Aspect Term. 

First, we verify whether the Aspect Term is 

part of a phrase which was matched to a pattern 

but no polarity was found as explained in section 

3.2, if so we get the subjectivity clues of the 

phrase and for each subjectivity clue we calculate 

𝑇𝑠𝑖,𝑗, where i is the Aspect Term index and j 

corresponds to the subjectivity clue index. If no 

polarity is found, then we calculate 𝑇𝑠𝑗,𝑖. 

If no polarities are found after this step, we 

proceed to do the same as above, but this time for 

each word in the sentence. 

Lastly, if no polarities are found, 𝑃𝑝𝑖 is 
obtained for each word i in the sentence if i has a 

state in the automata. 

After performing these steps we apply our 

selection criteria to assign the polarity to the 

Aspect Term in question. As can be seen, our 

proposal is focused on the application of an 

exhaustive exploration of the automata in order to 

classify Aspect Terms with the target polarities. 

4 Results and Discussion 

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the system 

several tests were run. Table 2 shows some of the 

tests using SemEval2014 task4 Baseline for the 

Restaurant reviews. We did the same evaluation 

for Laptop reviews and the results obtained were 

very similar to those shown in Table 2 for 

Restaurant. We used semeval_base.py2 script to 

split the dataset into a train and a test part using an 

80:20 ratio. Despite tests 1, 2 and 3 results do not 

vary much, it is evident that using the three 

training resources yields our best accuracy.

Table 2: Evaluation over restaurant domain 

With test 4 it is evident that it is better to use 

two methods combined than only one of them, 

since the patterns indicate the words that assign 

polarity to the Aspect Term, making the automata 

more precise with this information at the time of 

assigning the correct polarity. Otherwise, if a 

pattern is not encountered we need to analyse the 

words that are closer to the Aspect Term 

determining the polarity according to the context. 

In addition, not always is assigned a polarity to it 

in case of the pattern found in the context is 

empty. Table 3 shows the results of our system in

5 Conclusions and future works 

This work introduces a new approach for aspect 

based sentiment analysis. For that, a probabilistic 

automata was created where the states are formed 

by the nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs found 

in the annotated corpora, based on their 

occurrence. The transitions between states are 

also taken into account. A set of patterns were 

defined in order to extract the words that influence 

on an Aspect Term, also known as subjectivity 

clues, and then we predicted their polarity using 

the automata’s probabilities. A system was 

developed following this approach to participate 

on SemEval2014 competition, obtaining an 

accuracy of 66% for restaurant reviews and 57% 

for laptop reviews. 

As future works we plan to deal with the fact 

that this automata only involves states represented 

by the words lack extracted from the training data. 

So, the previously unseen aspect terms which do 

not correspond to any state in the automata, are 

not recognised in many cases as far as the polarity 

is concerned. To address this issue we plan to 

725



expand the aspect term dictionary using 

Wikipedia definitions. On the other hand, we plan 

to use a disambiguation method to select the exact 

WordNet synset and then to reduce the polysemy 

of the automata’s words. Finally, to smooth the 

probabilities it would be interesting to study 

different balances in order to get new 

improvements for the system.
