Abstract 

Web users are increasingly looking for 

structured data, such as lyrics, job, or recipes, 

using unstructured queries on the web. 

However, retrieving relevant results from such 

data is a challenging problem due to the 

unstructured language of the web queries. In 

this paper, we propose a method to improve 

web search ranking by detecting Structured 

Annotation of queries based on top search 

results. In a structured annotation, the original 

query is split into different units that are 

associated with semantic attributes in the 

corresponding domain. We evaluate our 

techniques using real world queries and achieve 

significant improvement. 

1 Introduction 

Search engines are getting more sophisticated by 

utilizing information from multiple diverse sources. 

One such valuable source of information is 

structured and semi-structured data, which is not 

very difficult to access, owing to information 

extraction (Wong et al., 2009; Etzioni et al., 2008; 

Zhai and Liu 2006) and semantic web efforts. 

                                                           
 *Work was done when the first author was visiting Microsoft 

Research Asia 

Driving the web search evolution are the user 

needs. Users usually have a template in mind when 

formulating queries to search for information. 

Agarwal et al., (2010) surveyed a search log of 15 

million queries from a commercial search engine. 

They found that 90% of queries follow certain 

templates. For example, by issuing the query 

“taylor swift lyrics falling in love”, the users are 

actually seeking for the lyrics of the song “Mary's 

Song (oh my my my)” by artist Taylor Swift. The 

words “falling in love” are actually part of the 

lyrics they are searching for. However, some top 

search results are irrelevant to the query, although 

they contain all the query terms. For example, the 

first top search result shown in Figure 1(a) does 

not contain the required lyrics. It just contains the 

lyrics of another song of Taylor Swift, rather than 

the song that users are seeking. 

A possible way to solve the above ranking 

problem is to understand the underlying query 

structure. For example, after recognizing that 

“taylor swift” is an artist name and “falling in love” 

are part of the lyrics, we can improve the ranking 

by comparing the structured query with the 

corresponding structured data in documents 

(shown in Figure 1(b)). Some previous studies 

investigated how to extract structured information 

from user queries, such as query segmentation 

(Bergsma and Wang, 2007). The task of query 

segmentation is to separate the query words into 

468



disjointed segments so that each segment maps to a 

semantic unit (Li et al., 2011). For example, the 

segmentation of the query “taylor swift lyrics 

falling in love” can be “taylor swift | lyrics | falling 

in love”. Since query segmentation cannot tell 

“talylor swift” is an artist name and “falling in love” 

are part of lyrics, it is still difficult for us to judge 

whether each part of the query segmentations 

matches the right field of the documents or not 

(such as judge whether “talylor swift” matches the 

artist name in the document). Recently, a lot of 

work (Sarkas et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009) proposed 

the task of structured annotation of queries which 

aims to detect the structure of the query and assign 

a specific label to it. However, to our knowledge, 

the previous methods do not exploit an effective 

approach for improving web search ranking by 

incorporating structured annotation of queries. 

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of 

using structured annotation of queries to improve 

web search ranking. Specifically, we propose a 

greedy algorithm which uses the structured data 

(named annotated tokens in Figure 1(b)) extracted 

from the top search results to annotate the latent 

structured semantics in web queries. We then 

compute matching scores between the annotated 

query and the corresponding structured 

information contained in documents. The top 

search results can be re-ranked according to the 

matching scores. However, it is very difficult to 

extract structured data from all of the search results. 

Hence, we propose a relevance feedback based re-

ranking model. We use these structured documents 

whose matching scores are greater than a threshold 

as feedback documents, to effectively re-rank other 

search results to bring more relevant and novel 

information to the user. 

Experiments on a large web search dataset from 

a major commercial search engine show that the F-

Measure of structured annotation generated by our 

approach is as high as 91%. On this dataset, our re-

ranking model using the structured annotations 

significantly outperforms two baselines. 

The main contributions of our work include: 

1. We propose a novel approach to generate 
structured annotation of queries based on top 

search results. 

2. Although structured annotation of queries has 
been studied previously, to the best of our 

knowledge this is the first paper that attempts 

to improve web search ranking by 

incorporating structured annotation of queries. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 

We briefly introduce related work in Section 2. 

Section 3 presents our method for generating 

structured annotation of queries. We then propose 

two novel re-ranking models based on structured 

annotation in Section 4. Section 5 introduces the 

data used in this paper. We report experimental 

results in Section 6. Finally we conclude the work 

in Section 7.

2 Related Work 

There is a great deal of prior research that 

identifies query structured information. We 

summarize this research according to their 

different approaches. 

2.1 Structured Annotation of Queries 

Recently, a lot of work has been done on 

understanding query structure (Sarkas et al., 2010; 

Li et al., 2009; Bendersky et al., 2010). One 

important method is structured annotation of 

queries which aims to detect the structure of the 

query and assign a specific label to it. Li et al., 

(2009) proposed web query tagging and its goal is 

to assign to each query term a specified category, 

roughly corresponding to a list of attributes. A 

semi-supervised Conditional Random Field (CRF) 

is used to capture dependencies between query 

words and to identify the most likely joint 

assignment of words to “categories.” Comparing 

with previous work, the advantages of our 

approach are on the following aspects. First, we 

generate structured annotation of queries based on 

top search results, not some global knowledge base 

or query logs. Second, they mainly focus on the 

method of generating structured annotation of 

queries, rather than leverage the generated query 

structures to improve web search rankings. In this 

paper, we not only offer a novel solution for 

generating structured annotation of queries, but 

also propose a re-ranking approach to improve 

Web search based on structured annotation of 

queries. Bendersky et al., (2011) also used top 

search results to generate structured annotation of 

queries. However, the annotations in their 

definition are capitalization, POS tags, and 

segmentation indicators, which are different from 

ours. 

2.2 Query Template Generation 

The concept of query template has been discussed 

in a few recent papers (Agarwal et al., 2010; Pasca 

2011; Liu et al., 2011; Szpektor et al., 2011). A 

query template is a sequence of terms, where each 

term could be a word or an attribute. For example, 

<#artist_name lyrics #lyrics> is a query template, 

“#artist_name” and “#lyrics” are attributes, and 

“lyrics” is a word. Structured annotation of queries 

is different from query template, as a query 

template can instantiate multiple queries while a 

structured annotation only serves for a specific 

query. Unlike query template, our work is ranking-

oriented. We aim to automatically annotate query 

structure based on top search results, and further 

use these structured annotations to re-rank top 

search results for improving search performance. 

2.3 Query Segmentation 

The task of query segmentation is to separate the 

query words into disjointed segments so that each 

segment maps to a semantic unit (Li et al., 2011). 

Query segmentation techniques have been well 

studied in recent literature (Tan and Peng, 2008; 

Yu and Shi, 2009). However, structured annotation 

of queries cannot only separate the query words 

into disjoint segments but can also assign each 

segment a semantic label which can help the search 

engine to judge whether each part of query 

segmentation matches the right field of the 

documents or not. 

2.4 Entity Search 

The problem of entity search has received a great 

deal of attention in recent years (Guo et al., 2009; 

Bron et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2007). Its goal is to 

answer information needs that focus on entities. 

The problem of structured annotation of queries is 

related to entity search because for some queries, 

structured annotation items are entities or attributes. 

Some existing entity search approaches also 

exploit knowledge from the structure of webpages 

(Zhao et al., 2005). Annotating query structured 

information differs from entity search in the 

following aspects. First, structured annotation 

based ranking is applicable for all queries, rather 

than just entity related queries. Second, the result 

of an entity search is usually a list of entities, their 

attributes, and associated homepages, whereas our 

work uses the structured information from 

webpages to annotate query structured information 

and further leverage structured annotation of 

queries to re-rank top search results.

3 Structured Annotation of Queries  

3.1 Problem Definition 

We start our discussion by defining some basic 

concepts. A token is defined as a sequence of 

words including space, i.e., one or more words. For 

example, the bigram “taylor swift” can be a single 

token. As our objective is to find structured 

annotation of queries in a specific domain, we 

begin with a definition of domain schema. 

Definition 1 (Domain Schema): For a given 

domain of interest, the domain schema is the set of 

attributes. We denote the domain schema as 𝐴 =
{𝑎1, 𝑎2, ⋯ , 𝑎𝑛}, where each 𝑎𝑖  is the name of an 
attribute of the domain. Sample domain schemas 

are shown in Table 1. In contrast to previous 

methods (Agarwal et al., 2010), our definition of 

domain schema does not need attribute values. For 

the sake of simplicity, this paper assumes that 

attributes in domain schema are available. 

However, it is not difficult to pre-specify attributes 

in a specific domain. 

Definition 2 (Annotated Token): An annotated 

token in a specific domain is a pair [𝑣, 𝑎], where v 
is a token and a is a corresponding attribute for v 

in this domain. [hey jude, #song_name] is an 

example of an annotated token for the “lyrics” 

domain shown in Table 1. The words “hey jude” 

comprise a token, and its corresponding attribute 

name is #song_name. If a token does not have any 

corresponding attributes, we denote it as free token. 

Definition 3 (Structured Annotation): A 

structured annotation p is a sequence of terms <
𝑠1,𝑠2,⋯,𝑠𝑘 >, where each 𝑠𝑖 could be a free token or 
an annotated token, and at least one of the terms is 

an annotated token, i.e., ∃𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑘] for which 𝑠𝑖 is 
an annotated token. 

Given the schema for the domain “lyrics”, 

<[taylor swift, #artist_name] lyrics [falling in love, 

#lyrics]> is a possible structured annotation for the 

query “taylor swift lyrics falling in love”. In this 

annotation, [taylor swift, #artist_name] and 

[falling in love, #lyrics] are two annotated tokens. 

The word “lyrics” is a free token. 

Intuitively, a structured annotation corresponds 

to an interpretation of the query as a request for 

some structured information from documents. The 

set of annotated tokens expresses the information 

need of the documents that have been requested. 

The free tokens may provide more diverse 

information. Annotated tokens and free tokens 

together cover all query terms, reflecting the 

complete user intent of the query. 

3.2 Generating Structured Annotation 

In this paper, given a domain schema A, we 

generate structured annotation for a query q based 

on the top search results of q. We propose using 

top search results, rather than some global 

knowledge base or query logs, because: 

(1) Top search results have been proven to be 
a successful technique for query explanation 

(Bendersky et al., 2010). 

(2) We have observed that in most cases, a 
reasonable percentage of the top search results are 

relevant to the query. By aggregating structured 

information from the top search results, we can get 

more query-dependent annotated tokens than using 

global data sources which may contain more noise 

and outdated. 

(3) Our goal for generating structured 
annotation is to improve the ranking quality of 

queries. Using top search results enables 

simultaneous and consistent detection of structured 

information from documents and queries. 

As mentioned in Section 3.1, we generate 

structured annotation of queries based on annotated 

tokens, which are actually structured data (shown 

in Figure 1(b)) embedded in web documents. In 

this paper, we assume that the annotated tokens are

available and we mainly focus on how to use these 

annotated tokens from top search results to 

generate structured annotation of queries. The 

approach is comprised of two parts, one for 

weighting annotated tokens and the other for 

generating structured annotation of queries based 

on the weighted annotated tokens. 

Weighting: As shown in Figure 1, annotated 

tokens extracted from top results may be 

inconsistent, and hence some of the extracted 

annotated tokens are less useful or even useless for 

generating structured annotation. 

We assume that a better annotated token should 

be supported by more top results; while a worse 

annotated token may appear in fewer results. 

Hence we aggregate all the annotated tokens 

extracted from top search results, and evaluate the 

importance of each unique one by a ranking-aware 

voting model as follows. For an annotated token [v, 

a], its weight w is defined as: 

                      𝑤 =
1

𝑁
∑ 𝑤𝑗1≤𝑗≤𝑁                           (1) 

where wj is a voting from document dj, and 

𝑤𝑗 = {
𝑁 − 𝑗 + 1

𝑁
,             if [𝑣, 𝑎] ∈ 𝑑𝑗

0,                      else        
 

Here, N is the number of top search results and j 

is the ranking position of document dj. We then 

generate a weighted annotated token [v, a, w] for 

each original unique token [v, a]. 

Generating: The process by which we map a 

query q to Structured Annotation is shown in 

Algorithm 1. The algorithm takes as input a list of 

weighted annotated tokens and the query q, and 

outputs the structured annotation of the query q. 

The algorithm first partitions the query q by 

comparing each sub-sequence of the query with all 

the weighted annotated tokens, and find the 

maximum matching annotated token (line 1 to line 

5). Then, if the degree of match is greater than the 

threshold 𝛿 which is a pre-defined threshold score 
for fuzzy string matching, the query substring will 

be assigned the attribute label of the maximum 

matching annotated token (line 6 to line 8). The 

algorithm stops when all the weighted annotated 

tokens have been scanned, and outputs the 

structured annotation of the query.  

Note that in some cases, the query may fail to 

exactly match with the annotated tokens, due to 

spelling errors, acronyms or abbreviations in users’ 

queries. For example, in the query “broken and 

beatuful lyrics”, “broken and beatuful” is a 

misspelling of “broken and beautiful.” We adopt a 

fuzzy string matching function for comparing a 

sub-sequence string s with a token v: 

          𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑠, 𝑣) = 1 −
𝐸𝑑𝑖𝑡𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒(𝑠,𝑣)

max (|𝑠|,|𝑣|)
                (2) 

where EditDistance(s, v) measures the edit 

distances of two strings, |s| is the length of string s 

and |v| is the length of string v. 

4 Ranking with Structured Annotation 

Given a domain schema 𝐴 = {𝑎1, 𝑎2, ⋯ , 𝑎𝑛}, and a 
query q, suppose that 𝑝 = < 𝑠1,𝑠2,⋯,𝑠𝑘 >  is the 
structured annotation for query q obtained using 

the method introduced in the above sections. p can 

better reflects the user’s real search intent than the 

original q, as it presents the structured semantic 

information needed instead of a simple word string. 

Therefore, a document di can better satisfy a user’s 

information need if it contains corresponding 

structured semantic information in p. Suppose that 

Ti is the set of annotated tokens extracted from 

document di, we compute a re-ranking score, 

denoted by RScore, for document di as follows: 

RScore(q, di) = 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑞, 𝑑𝑖) 

                      = 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑝, 𝑇𝑖) 

                      = ∑ ∑ 𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑠𝑗 , 𝑡)𝑡∈𝑇𝑖1≤𝑗≤𝑘  

where 

  𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ(𝑠𝑗 , 𝑡)= {
𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑠𝑗 . 𝑣𝑗 , 𝑡. 𝑣),        if 𝑠𝑗 . 𝑎𝑗 = 𝑡. 𝑎

0,                                else
      (3) 

where 𝑠𝑗  is an annotated token in p and t is an 

annotated token in di. We use Equation (2) to 

compute the similarity between values in query 

annotated tokens and values in document annotated 

tokens. We propose two re-ranking models, 

namely the conservative re-ranking model, to re-

rank top results based on RScore and relevance 

feedback based re-ranking model. 

4.1 Conservative Re-ranking Model 

A nature way to re-rank top search results is 

according to their RScore. However, we fail to 

obtain annotated tokens from some retrieved 

documents, and hence the RScore of these 

documents are not available. In the conservative 

re-ranking model, we only re-rank search results 

that have an RScore. For example, suppose there 

are five retrieved documents {d1, d2, d3, d4, d5} for 

query q, we can extract structured information 

from document d3 and d4 and RScore(q, d4) > 

RScore(q, d3). Note that we cannot obtain 

472



structured information from d1, d2, and d5.  In the 

conservative re-ranking method, d1, d2, and d5 

retain their original positions; while d3 and d4 will 

be re-ranked according to their RScore. Therefore, 

the final ranking generated by our conservative re-

ranking model should be {d1, d2, d4, d3, d5}, in 

which the documents are re-ranked among the 

affected positions. 

There is also useful information in the 

documents without structured data, such as 

community question answering websites. However, 

in the conservative re-ranking model they will not 

be re-ranked. This may hurt the performance of our 

re-ranking model. One reasonable solution is 

relevance feedback model. 

4.2 Relevance Feedback based Re-ranking 
Model 

The disadvantage of the conservative re-ranking 

model is that it only can re-rank those top search 

results with structured data. To make up its 

limitation, we propose a relevance feedback based 

re-ranking model. The key idea of this model is 

based on the observation that the search results 

with the corrected annotated tokens could give 

implicit feedback information. Hence, we use these 

structured documents whose RScore are greater 

than a threshold γ (empirically set it as 0.6) as 
feedback documents, to effectively re-rank other 

search results to bring more relevant and novel 

information to the user. 

Formally, given a query Q and a document 

collection C, a retrieval system returns a ranked list 

of documents D. Let di denote the i-th ranked 

document in the ranked list. Our goal is to study 

how to use these feedback documents, J ⊆ {d1,…, 
dk}, to effectively re-rank the other r search results: 

U ⊆ {dk+1,…, dk+r}. A general formula of relevance 
feedback model (Salton et al, 1990) R is as follows: 

𝑅(𝑄′) = (1 − α)𝐿𝑞(Q) + α𝐿𝑑(J)             (4) 

where α ∈ [0, 1] is the feedback coefficient, and 𝐿𝑞 

and 𝐿𝑑 are two models that map a query and a set 
of relevant documents, respectively, into some 

comparable representations. For example, they can 

be represented as vectors of weighted terms or 

language models. 

In this paper, we explore the problem in the 

language model framework, particularly the KL-

divergence retrieval model and mixture-model 

feedback method (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001), mainly 

because language models deliver state-of-the-art 

retrieval performance and the mixture-model based 

feedback is one of the most effective feedback 

techniques which outperforms Rocchio feedback. 

4.2.1 The KL-Divergence Retrieval Model 

The KL-divergence retrieval model was introduced 

in Lafferty and Zhai, (2001) as a special case of the 

risk minimization retrieval framework and can 

support feedback more naturally. In this model, 

queries and documents are represented by unigram 

language models. Assuming that these language 

models can be appropriately estimated, KL-  

divergence retrieval model measures the relevance 

value of a document D with respect to a query Q 

by computing the negative Kullback-Leibler 

divergence between the query language model 𝜃𝑄 

and the document language model 𝜃𝐷 as follows: 

𝑆(𝑄, 𝐷) = −𝐷(𝜃𝑄||𝜃𝐷) = − ∑ 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝑄)𝑙𝑜𝑔
𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝑄)

𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝐷)
𝑤∈𝑉       (5) 

where V is the set of words in our vocabulary. 

Intuitively, the retrieval performance of the KL-

divergence relies on the estimation of the 

document model 𝜃𝐷 and the query model 𝜃𝑄.  

For the set of k relevant documents, the 

document model 𝜃𝐷  is estimated as 𝑝(w|𝜃𝐷) =
1

𝑘
∑

𝑐(𝑤,𝑟𝑖)

|𝑟𝑖|
𝑘
𝑖=1 , where 𝑐(𝑤, 𝑟𝑖) is the count of word 

w in the i-th relevant document, and |𝑟𝑖| is the total 
number of words in that document. The document 

model 𝜃𝐷  needs to be smoothed and an effective 
method is Dirichlet smoothing (Zhai et al., 2001). 

The query model intuitively captures what the 

user is interested in, and thus would affect retrieval 

performance. With feedback documents, 𝜃𝑄  is 
estimated by the mixture-model feedback method. 

4.2.2 The Mixture Model Feedback Method 

As the problem definition in Equation (4), the 

query model can be estimated by the original query 

model 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝑄) =
𝑐(𝑤,𝑄)

|𝑄|
 (where c(w,Q) is the count 

of word w in the query Q, and |Q| is the total 

number of words in the query) and the feedback 

document model. Zhai and Lafferty, (2001) 

proposed a mixture model feedback method to 

estimate the feedback document model. More 

specifically, the model assumes that the feedback 

documents can be generated by a background 

language model 𝑝(𝑤|𝐶) estimated using the whole 
collection and an unknown topic language model 

473



𝜃𝐹 to be estimated. Formally, let F ⊂ C be a set of 
feedback documents. In this paper, F is comprised 

of documents that RScore are greater thanγ. The 
log-likelihood function of the mixture model is: 

𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐹|𝜃𝐹) = 

      ∑ ∑ 𝑐(𝑤, 𝐷)𝑤∈𝑉 log [(1 − 𝜆)𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝐹) + 𝜆𝑝(𝑤|𝐶)]𝐷∈𝐹     (6) 

where 𝜆 ∈ [0,1)  is a mixture noise parameter 
which controls the weight of the background 

model. Given a fixed 𝜆, a standard EM algorithm 
can then be used to estimate 𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝐹), which is 
then interpolated with the original query model 

𝑝(𝑤|Q) to obtain an improved estimation of the  
query model: 

𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝑄) = (1 − 𝛼)𝑝(𝑤|𝑄) + 𝛼𝑝(𝑤|𝜃𝐹)         (7) 

 where 𝛼 is the feedback coefficient. 

5 Data 

We used a dataset composed of 12,396 queries 

randomly sampled from query logs of a search 

engine. For each query, we retrieved its top 100 

results from a commercial search engine. The 

documents were judged by human editors. A five-

grade (from 0 to 4 meaning from bad to perfect) 

relevance rating was assigned for each document. 

We used a proprietary query domain classifier to 

identify queries in three domains, namely “lyrics,”  

“recipe,” and “job,” from the dataset. The statistics 

about these domains are shown in Table 2. To 

investigate how many queries may potentially have 

structured annotations, we manually created 

structured annotations for these queries. The last 

column of Table 2 shows the percentage of queries 

that have structured annotations created by 

annotators. We found that for each domain, there 

was on average more than 90% of queries 

identified by us that had a certain structured 

annotation. This indicates that a large percentage 

of these queries contain structured information, as 

we expected. 

6 Experimental Results 

In this section, we present the structured annotation 

of queries and further re-rank the top search results 

for the three domains introduced in Section 5. We 

used the ranking returned by a commercial search 

engine as our one of the Baselines. Note that as the 

baseline already uses a large number of ranking 

signals, it is very difficult to improve it any further. 

We evaluate the ranking quality using the widely 

used Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain 

measure (NDCG) (Javelin and Kekalainen., 2000). 

We use the same configuration for NDCG as 

(Burges et al. 2005). More specifically, for a given 

query q, the NDCG@K is computed as: 

                        𝑁𝑞 =  
1

𝑀𝑞

∑ (2𝑟(𝑗)−1)𝐾𝑗=1

log (1 + 𝑗)
                            (4) 

Mq is a normalization constant (the ideal NDCG) 

so that a perfect ordering would obtain an NDCG 

of 1; and r(j) is the rating score of the j-th  

document in the ranking list.  

6.1 Overall Results 

6.1.1 Quality of Structured Annotation of 
Queries 

We generated the structured annotation of queries 

based on the top 10 search results and used 𝛿 =

0.04  for Algorithm 1. We used several existing 

metrics, P (Precision), R (Recall), and F-Measure 

to evaluate the quality of the structured annotation. 

As a query structured annotation may contain more 

than one annotated token, we concluded that the

annotation was correct only if the entire annotation 

was completely the same as the annotation labeled 

by annotators. Otherwise we treated the structured 

annotation as incorrect. Experimental results for 

the three domains are shown in Table 3. We 

compare our approach with Xiao Li, (2010) 

(denoted as baseline), on the dataset described in 

Section 5. They labeled the semantic structure of 

noun phrase queries based on semi-Markov CRFs. 

Our approach achieves better performance than the 

baseline (about 5.5% significant improvement on 

F-Measure). This indicates that the approach of 

generating structured annotation based on the top 

search results is more effective. With the high-

quality structured annotation of queries in hand, it 

may be possible to obtain better ranking results 

using our proposed re-ranking models. 

6.1.2 Re-ranking Result 

We used the models introduced in Section 4 to re-

rank the top 10 search results, based on structured 

annotation of queries and annotated tokens.  

Recall that our goal is to quantify the 

effectiveness of structured annotation of queries 

for real web search. One dimension is to compare 

with the original search results of a commercial 

search engine (denoted as Ori-Ranker). The other 

is to compare with the query segmentation based 

re-ranking model (denoted as Seg-Ranker; Li et 

al., 2011) which tries to improve web search 

ranking by incorporating query segmentation. Li et 

al., (2011) incorporated query segmentation in the 

BM25, unigram language model and bigram 

language model retrieval framework, and bigram 

language model achieved the best performance. In 

this paper, Seg-Ranker integrates bigram language 

model with query segmentation. 

The ranking results of these models are shown 

in Figure 2. This figure shows that all our two 

rankers significantly outperform the Ori-Ranker– 

the original search results of a commercial search 

engine. This means that using high-quality 

structured annotation does help better 

understanding of user intent. By comparing these 

structured annotations and the annotated tokens in 

documents, we can re-rank the more relevant 

results higher and yield better ranking quality. 

Figure 2 also suggests that structured annotation 

based re-ranking models outperform query 

segmentation based re-ranking model. This is 

mainly because structured annotation can not only 

separate the query words into disjoint segments but 

can also assign each segment a semantic label. 

Taking full advantage of the semantic label can 

lead to better ranking performance. 

Furthermore, Figure 2 shows that FB-Ranker 

outperforms Con-Ranker. The main reason is that 
in Con-Ranker, we can only reasonably re-rank the 

search results with structured data. However, in 

FB-Ranker we can not only re-rank the structured 

search results but also can re-rank other documents 

by incorporating implicit information from those 

structured documents.  

On average, FB-Ranker achieves the best 

ranking performance. Table 4 shows more detailed 

Table 4. Detailed ranking results on three domains.

results for the three selected domains. This table 

shows that FB-Ranker consistently outperforms the 

two baseline rankers on these domains. In the 

remaining part of this paper, we will only report 

the results for this ranker, due to space limitations. 

Table 4 also indicates that we can get robust 

ranking improvement in different domains, and we 

will consider applying it to more domains. 

6.2 Experiment with Different Thresholds of 
Query Structured Annotation Algorithm 

As introduced in Algorithm 1, we pre-defined a 

threshold δ for fuzzy string matching. We 

evaluated the quality of re-ranking and query 

structured annotation with different settings for δ. 

The results are shown in Figure 3. We found that: 

(1) When we use δ = 0, which means that the 
structured annotations can be generated no matter 

how small the similarity between the query string 

and a weighted annotated token is, we can get a 

significant NDCG@3 gain of 2.15%. Figure 3(b) 

shows that the precision of the structured 

annotation is lowest when δ = 0 . However, the 
precision is still as high as 0.7375, and the highest 

recall is obtained in this case. This means that the 

quality of the generated structured annotations is 

still reasonable, and hence we can get a ranking 

improvement when δ = 0, as shown in Figure 3(a). 
(2) Figure 3(a) suggests that the quality of re-

ranking increases when the threshold δ increases 

from 0 to 0.05. It then decreases when δ increases 

from 0.06 to 0.5. Comparing these two figures 

shows that the trend of re-ranking performance 

adheres to the quality of the structured annotation. 

The settings for δ dramatically affect the recall and 

precision of the structured annotation; and hence 

the ranking quality is impacted. The larger δ is, the 

lower the recall of the structured annotation is. 

(3) Since the re-ranking performance 
dramatically changes along with the quality of the 

structured annotation, we conducted a re-ranking 

experiment with perfect structured annotations (F-

Measure equal to 1.0). Perfect structured 

annotations mean the annotations created by 

annotators as introduced in Section 5. The results 

are shown in the last bar of Figure 3(a). We did not 

find a large space for ranking improvement. The 

NDCG@3 when using perfect structured 

annotations was 0.606, which is just slightly better 

than our best result (yield when δ=0.05). It 

indicates that our structured annotation generation 

algorithm is already quite effective. 

(4) Figure 3(a) shows that our approach 
outperforms the two baseline approaches with most 

settings for δ. This indicates that our approach is 

relatively stable with different settings for δ. 

6.3 Experiment with Number of Top Search 
Results 

The above experiments are conducted based on the 

top 10 search results. In this section, by adjusting 

the number of top search results, ranging from 2 to 

100, we investigate whether the quality of 

structured annotation of queries and the 

performance of re-ranking are affected by the 

quantity of search results. The results shown in 

Figure 4 indicate that the number of search results 

does affect the quality of structured annotation of 

queries and the performance of re-ranking. 

Structured annotations of queries become better 

when more search results are used from 2 to 20. 

This is because more search results cover more 

websites in our domain list, and hence can generate 

more annotated tokens. More results also provide 

more evidence for voting the importance of

annotated tokens, and hence can improve the 

quality of structured annotation of queries. 

In addition, we also found that structured 

annotation of queries become worse when too 

many lower ranked results are used (e.g, using 

results ranked lower than 20). This is because the 

lower ranked results are less relevant than the 

higher ranked results. They may contain more 

irrelevant or noisy annotated tokens than higher 

ranked documents; and hence using them may 

harm the precision of the structured annotations. 

Figure 4 also indicates that the quality of ranking 

and the accuracy of structured annotations are 

correlated. 

7 Conclusions 

In this paper, we studied the problem of improving 

web search ranking by incorporating structured 

annotation of queries. We proposed a systematic 

solution, first to generate structured annotation of 

queries based on top search results, and then 

launching two structured annotation based re-

ranking models. We performed a large-scale 

evaluation over 12,396 queries from a major search 

engine. The experiment results show that the F-

Measure of query structured annotation generated 

by our approach is as high as 91%. In the same 

dataset, our structured annotation based re-ranking 

model significantly outperforms the original ranker 

– the ranking of a major search engine, with 

improvements 5.2%.
