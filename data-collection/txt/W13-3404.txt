Abstract 

Multilinguality has been an essential feature of 
the International Linguistic Olympiad since its 
conception.  Although deemed most desirable, 
the production of a problem set in several par-
allel versions and the verification of their 
equivalence is a time-consuming and error-
prone task.  This paper tells about the efforts 
to develop tools and methods which increase 
its efficiency and reliability. 

1 Introduction 
In September 2003 the 1st International Linguis-
tics Olympiad (IOL, née International Olympiad 
in Theoretical, Mathematical and Applied Lin-
guistics), an annual contest for secondary-school 
students in solving self-sufficient linguistic prob-
lems (Derzhanski, Payne 2009), took place in 
Bulgaria.  Six countries were represented by a 
total of 33 participants.  At the 10th instalment in 
2012 the countries were 26, the contestants 131, 
and both numbers keep growing. 

Since its launching, multilinguality has been a 
crucial feature of IOL.  A linguistic problem de-
pends more on the language in which it is formu-
lated than a problem in, e.g., mathematics: not 
every problem can work in all languages, and 
even when it can, producing versions which give 
equal chances to all contestants is not always 
straightforward.  For this reason at IOL, unlike 
many other international fora, there is no ques-
tion of limiting the working languages to one or 
just a few.  Accordingly their number has grown 
from five at IOL1 to fifteen at IOL10.1  For the 

                                                 

                                                                         

1 In fact at IOL1 and some subsequent early IOLs the ver-
sions that were made outnumbered the actual working lan-
guages by one, because an English version was made, al-
though not used at the contest, for general reference and for 
advertising.  At some of the recent IOLs, too, there have 

same reason the versions of the problem set in all 
working languages can’t be created immediately 
before the contest, as is done at some of the other 
international science olympiads; they need to be 
prepared and verified well in advance. 

The production of the multilingual package is 
a time-consuming and error-prone task, and it 
calls for the development of tools and methods to 
increase its efficiency and reliability. 

2 The Past: IOL1 
A linguistic problem is composed of language 
material and surrounding text; the language ma-
terial in turn consists of data in unfamiliar lan-
guages and in Solverese2 (usually translations of 
the unfamiliar language data).  In a multilingual 
edition of the problem set it is imperative that the 
Solverese parts be equivalent and everything else 
be identical. 

Figure 1 presents half a page from the Dutch 
and the English versions of the IOL1 problem 
set.  It is easy to see that the formatting, the for-
mulae and the Egyptian Arabic expressions had 
to be exactly the same. 

In order to minimise the effort needed to edit 
the problems in all working languages and the 
chance that a technical mishap might create a 
divergence where none should occur, an ad hoc 
method was invented.  The problem set was writ-
ten in LATEX,

 3 with a master source file for each 

 
been more versions than working languages, as the versions 
in British and American English have been separate, though 
only differing in the format of the dates and in the spelling 
of a few words. 
2 On this term see (Bozhanov, Derzhanski 2013, fn. 2). 
3 This choice was made because TEX is not a mere typeset-
ting system but a full-fledged programming environment, 
which enables some of the text to be computed rather than 
typed, greatly reducing the danger of typographic errors.  
The most powerful inspiration was (Knuth 1986, p. 218); 
see also (Derzhanski 2009, Appendix A).

language version and a file of common macro 
definitions, input by all master files. 

Figure 2 shows how this works.  The excerpts 
from the master files generate the text of the 
problem seen in Figure 1.  Both master files refer 
to the shared macro file for the set of equalities 
in the data (\fracdata) and the equality in the 
assignment (\fractest).  The macro file also 

takes care of the uniformity of the formatting of 
problems and assignments, although the words 
for ‘Problem’ and ‘Assignment’ in the respective 
languages are defined in the master files 
(\probword and \asgtword). 

The same technique saves repetition within 
each text, for example, when handling a very 
common form of assignment: 

\def \fordword #1{Vertaal in het #1} 

\assignment \fordword {Nederlands}: [twice (in Problem 1 and in Problem 4)] 
\assignment \fordword {Baskisch}: 
\assignment \fordword {Adygisch}: 
\assignment \fordword {Adygisch}, op alle mogelijke manieren: 
\def \fordword #1{Translate into #1} 

\assignment \fordword {English}:  [twice (as above)] 
\assignment \fordword {Basque}: 
\assignment \fordword {Adyghe}: 
\assignment \fordword {Adyghe} in all possible ways:

The system made the production of the six paral-
lel problem sets significantly more efficient and 
reliable than if six separate documents had been 
written.  Still, much material is shared by the 
source files, and as can be seen from Figure 1, 
the texts in Dutch and in English differ more 
than they need to. 

3 The Present: IOL6 and onwards 
The problem sets for IOL2–5 were prepared in 
Microsoft Word as separate documents, and the 
identity of the unknown language material 
as well as the equivalence of the Solverese texts 
was checked entirely by human eye and hand.  
By the time the LATEX-based multilingual system 
was revived (in 2008), things had changed in 
several respects.  The number of participants in 
IOL had grown significantly, as had the quantity 
and diversity of the working languages; IOL it-
self had become more mature, and harder prob-
lems were being assigned; most importantly, the 
awareness of IOL’s Problem Committee of the 
need to invest more time and attention into the 
preparation of the problem set (Derzhanski et al., 
2004) had increased.  But with only so many 
days in the year, this all meant that the multilin-
gual process often had to start before the content 
of the problems had been finalised, with changes 
sometimes proving necessary as an effect of this 
process, as it emerged that some problems (or 
parts of them), especially problems involving 
word semantics, would be easier, or certain ex-
planations make more sense, in some languages 

than in others.4  And having to make the same 
content change in several parallel texts is unde-
sirable, for obvious reasons. 

Therefore when the system came back to life 
in the weeks before IOL6, it did so as its own 
antithesis.  In the new version, which has been in 
use ever since, the main source files for the indi-
vidual Solverese versions are very brief.  Apart 
from setting the paper size and the encodings and 
invoking the Babel package (Braams, 2008) with 
the appropriate language settings, each inputs 
two other files.  One is composed entirely of 
macro definitions; this is effectively a pseu-
docode-to-Solverese dictionary.  The other is the 
text of the problems (statements and solutions), 
the same for all versions, written entirely in the 
said pseudocode. 

                                                 
4 Several early versions of Problem IOL10#5 (on Rotuman, 
by Boris Iomdin and Alexander Piperski) required the 
solver to make the conjecture that in Rotuman the word for 
‘grey’ is derived from the word for ‘ashes’, but this word 
was removed from the assignment at the final stage, when it 
was brought to the Problem Committee’s attention that the 
same is true of three of IOL10’s working languages. 

The canonical solution of Problem IOL5#3 (on Georgian 
verb morphology, by Yakov Testelets), first composed in 
Russian, suggested that predsedatel’stvovat’ was too long a 
word to gloss a suppletive Georgian verb; this was crossed 
out because the corresponding verb in English, chair, is 
arguably only two phonemes long. 

The original Russian text of Problem IOL1#1 (on Jacob 
Linzbach’s Transcendental Algebra, by Ksenia Gilyarova) 
glossed the verb ♥ in the same way (ljubit’) whether it re-
ferred to loving people or liking things, but the final version 
used different expressions because in Estonian there was no 
other choice.

lem set; Figure 5, the text of this problem in 
pseudocode and some excerpts from the Dutch 
and English dictionary files. 

How much granularity is desirable depends on 
the variety of the data and the regularity of the 
relevant fragments of the grammars of the fea-
tured and the working languages.  Breaking 
down a sentence such as He ate the fish (and its 
equivalents) into subject, verb and object and 
generating each by its own macro makes the 
most sense if the same constituents also appear 

elsewhere in the text, but it always makes verifi-
cation easier. 

One important advantage of this approach 
over the others was already noted: if a content 
change in some problem (adding, replacing or 
deleting some item in the data or the assign-
ments) is required, it is made in one place only, 
reducing the danger of error.  Another lies in the 
making of the dictionaries.  Those are prepared 
by filling the cells of a spreadsheet, with all lan-
guages in parallel columns.  Figure 6 shows a 
screenshot containing part of the spreadsheet for 
IOL10 (several rows and six of the 15 working 
languages).

This makes it easy to compare words or sen-
tences in any two languages and to find mis-
matches and imbalances.  Also, since the order-
ing of the rows of the spreadsheet is immaterial, 
they can be arranged and rearranged to group 
certain words or sentences in close rows in order 
to make similarities or differences stand out.5

A final advantage is the move away from the 
model (disadvantageous for more than one rea-
son6) in which the version of a problem in one 
working language is the original and the other 

                                                 
5 One of the phenomena in Problem IOL10#1 (on Dyirbal, 
by Artūrs Semeņuks) was factitive morphology; it was illus-
trated by several deadjectival verbs, which could be trans-
lated as lexical factitives (bent → bend, healthy → heal) or 
as periphrastic ones (fat → make fat, sleep → make fall 
asleep), but which were which differed from one working 
language to the other.  In order to guarantee the equal diffi-
culty of the problem in all versions it was necessary to en-
sure that each language used factitives of several types, 
which was facilitated by the summary character of the 
spreadsheet. 
6 At IOL5, where some versions of the problem set were 
made by translating the English one, the sentence ‘Knowl-
edge of English is not necessary for solving the problem’ 
was supposed to be present in one of the problems, but was 
omitted from the English version (because of its obvious 
inappropriateness there) and therefore didn’t make it into 
the other ones either; this was considered a grave mishap. 

versions are translations.  The parallel production 
of all Solverese versions from the same pseu-
docode source and with use of dictionaries made 
from a table where all working languages are 
uniformly situated creates the effect of (machine) 
translation from pseudocode to all languages, 
which in turn makes all languages equal.  At a 
contest such as IOL, where all contestants are to 
have the same chances regardless of their work-
ing languages, this is of vital importance. 

The method has been tested and proven to 
work with two Cyrillic-written and 12 Roman-
written languages, as well as Korean (at IOL7) 
and Hebrew (at IOL10), with hardly any techni-
cal difficulties.  It remains to be seen whether it 
will meet just as cheerfully the predictable fur-
ther growth of the number and diversity of IOL’s 
working languages, but it is certain that its poten-
tial has not yet been fully explored.
