Abstract

In Japanese, particularly, spoken Japanese,
subjective, objective and possessive cases are
very often omitted. Such Japanese sentences
are often translated by Japanese-English sta-
tistical machine translation to the English sen-
tence whose subjective, objective and posses-
sive cases are omitted, and it causes to de-
crease the quality of translation. We per-
formed experiments of J-E phrase based trans-
lation using Japanese sentence, whose omitted
pronouns are complemented by human. We
introduced ‘antecedent F-measure’ as a score
for measuring quality of the translated En-
glish. As a result, we found that it improves
the scores of antecedent F-measure while the
BLEU scores were almost unchanged. Every
effectiveness of the zero pronoun resolution
differs depending on the type and case of each
zero pronoun.

1 Introduction

Today, statistical translation systems have been able
to translate between languages at high accuracy us-
ing a lot of corpora . However, the quality of trans-
lation of Japanese to English is not high compar-
ing with the other language pairs that have the sim-
ilar syntactic structure such as the French-English
pair. Particularly, the quality of translation from
spoken Japanese to English is in low. There are
many reasons for the low quality. One is the dif-
ferent syntactic structures, that is, Japanese sentence
structure is SOV while English one is SVO. This
problem has been partly solved by head finalization

techniques (Isozaki et al., 2010). Another big prob-
lem is that subject, object and possessive cases are
often eliminated in Japanese, particularly, spoken
Japanese (Nariyama, 2003). In the case of Japanese
to English translation, the source language has lesser
information in surface than the target language, and
the quality of the translation tends to be low. We
show the example of the omissions in Fig 1. In this
example, the Japanese subject watashi wa (‘I’) and
the object anata ni (‘to you’) are eliminated in the
sentence. These omissions are not problems for hu-
man speakers and hearers because people easily rec-
ognize who is the questioner or responder (that is,
‘I’ and ‘you’) from the context. However, gener-
ally speaking, the recognition is difficult for statisti-
cal translation systems.

Some European languages allow the elimination
of subject. We show an example in Spanish in Fig 2.
In this case, the subject is eliminated, and it leaves
traces including the case and the sex, on the related
verb. The Spanish word, tengo is the first person
singular form of the verb, tener (it means ‘have’).
So it is easier to resolve elimination comparing with
Japanese one for SMT.

Otherwise, Japanese verbs usually have no inflec-
tional form depending on the case and sex. So,
we need take another way for elimination resolu-
tion. For example, if the eliminated Japanese sub-
ject is always ‘I’ when the sentence is declara-
tive, and the subject is always ‘you’ when the sen-
tence is a question sentence, phrase based transla-
tion systems are probably able to translate subject-
eliminated Japanese sentences to correct English
sentences. However, the hypothesis is not always

In this paper, we show that the quality of spoken

Japanese to English translation can improve using
a phrase-based translation system if we can use an
ideal elimination resolution system. However, we
also show that a simple elimination resolution sys-
tem is not effective to the improvement and it is nec-
essary to recognize correctly the modality of the sen-
tence.

2 Previous Work

There are a few researches for adaptation of ellip-
sis resolution to statistical translation systems while
there are a lot of researches for one to rule-based
translation systems in Japanese (Yoshimoto, 1988;
Dohsaka, 1990; Nakaiwa and Yamada, 1997; Ya-
mamoto et al., 1997).

As a research of SMT using elimination resolu-
tion, we have (Furuichi et al., 2011). However, the
target of the research is illustrative sentences in En-
glish to Japanese dictionary. Our research aims spo-
ken language translation and it is different from the
paper.

3 Setup of the Data of Subjects and
Objects Ellipsis in Spoken Japanese

3.1 Ellipsis Resolved Data by Human
In this section, we describe the data used in our ex-
periments. We used BTEC (Basic Travel Expres-

sion Corpus) corpus (Kikui et al., 2003) distributed
in IWSLT07 (Fordyce, 2007). The corpus consists
of tourism-related sentences similar to those that
are usually found in phrasebooks for tourists going
abroad. The characteristics of the dataset are shown
in Table 1. We used ‘train’ for training, ‘devset1-
3’ for tuning, and ‘test’ for evaluation. We did not
use the ‘devset4’ and ‘devset5’ sets because of the
different number of English references.

We annotated zero pronouns and the antecedents
to the sentences by hand. Here, zero pronoun is de-
fined as an obligatory case noun phrase that is not
expressed in the utterance but can be understood
through other utterances in the discourse, context, or
out-of-context knowledge (Yoshimoto, 1988). We
annotated the zero pronouns based on pronouns in
the translated English sentences. The BTEC corpus
has multi-references in English. We first chose the
most syntactically and lexically similar translation
in the references and annotated zero pronouns in it.
Our target pronouns are I, my, me, mine, myself, we,
our, us, ours, ourselves, you, your, yourself, your-
selves, he, his, him, himself, she, her, herself, it, its,
itself, they, their, them, theirs and themselves in En-
glish. We show the distribution of the annotation
types in the test set in Table 2.

3.2 Baseline System

We also examined a simple baseline zero pronoun
resolution system for the same data. We defined

Japanese predicate as verb, adjective, and copula (da
form) in the experiments. If the inputted Japanese
sentence contains predicates and it does not contain
‘wa’ (a binding particle and a topic marker), ‘mo’ (a
binding particle, which means ‘also’ and can often
replace ‘wa’ and ‘ga’), and ‘ga’ (a case particle and
subjective marker), the system regards the sentence
as a candidate sentence to solve the zero pronouns.
Then, if the candidate sentence is declarative, the
system inserts ‘watashi wa (I)’ when the predicate
is a verb, and ‘sore wa (it)’ when the predicate is a
adjective or a copula. In the same way, if the candi-
date sentence is a question, the system inserts ‘anata
wa (you)’ when the predicate is a verb, and ‘sore wa
(it)’ when the predicate is a adjective or a copula.
These inserted position is the beginning of the sen-
tence. In the case that the sentence is imperative, the
system does not solve the zero pronouns (Fig. 3).

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental Setting

Fig. 4 shows the outline of the procedure of our ex-
periment. We used Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) for
the training of the translation and language models,
tuning with MERT (Och, 2003) and the decoding.
First, we prepared the data for learning which con-
sists of parallel English and Japanese sentences. We
used MeCab 1 as Japanese tokenizer and the tok-
enizer in Moses Tool kit as English tokenizer. We
used default settings for the parameters of Moses.
Next, Moses learns language model and translation
model from the Japanese and English sentence pairs.
Then, the learned model was tuned by completed
sentences with MERT. and Moses decoded the com-
pleted Japanese sentences to English sentences.

4.2 Evaluation Method

We used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and an-
tecedent Precision, Recall and F-measure for the

1http://mecab.sourceforge.net/

evaluation of the performances, comparing the sys-
tem outputs with the English references of test data.
Using only BLEU score is not adequate for evalua-
tion of pronoun translation (Hardmeier et al., 2010).

We were inspired empty node recovery evaluation
by (Johnson, 2002) and defined antecedent Preci-
sion (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F) as follows,

P =
|G ∩ S|
|S|

R =
|G ∩ S|
|G|

F =
2PR

P + R
Here, S is the set of each pronoun in English

translated by decoder, G is the set of the gold stan-
dard zero pronoun.

We evaluated the effect of performance of every
case among completed sentences by human, ones by
the baseline system, and the original sentences.

4.3 Experimental Result
We show the BLEU scores in Table 3. and the an-
tecedent precision, recall and F-measure in Table 4.
The BLEU scores for experiments using our base-
line system and human annotation, are slightly bet-
ter than for one without ellipsis resolution, 45.4%
and 45.6%, respectively. However, the scores of an-
tecedent F-measure have major difference between
‘original’ and ‘human’. Particularly, the recall is im-
proved. Each 1st, 2nd and 3rd person score is better
than original one.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

We performed experiments of J-E phrase based
translation using Japanese sentences, whose omit-
ted pronouns are complemented by human and a
baseline system. Using ‘antecedent F-measure’ as a
score for measuring the quality of the translated En-
glish, it improves the score of antecedent F-measure.

Figure 3: Our baseline system of zero pronoun resolution

differed, depending on the type and case of each zero
pronoun. The F-measures for the first person pro-
noun were smaller than expected ones, Rather, the
scores for and possessive pronouns second person
were greater (Table. 3).

We show a better, a worse, and an unchanged
cases of translation using the baseline system of
the elimination resolution in Fig. 5. The left-hand
is the result of the alignment between the origi-
nal Japanese sentence and the decoded English sen-
tence. The right-hand is the result of one using
the Japanese the baseline system solved zero pro-
nouns. In the ‘better’ case, the alignment of todoke-
te (send) is better than one of the original sen-
tence, and ‘Can you’ is compensated by the solved
zero pronoun anata-wa (you-TOP). Otherwise, in
the ‘worse’ case, our baseline system could not rec-
ognize that the sentence is imperative, and inserted
watashi-wa (I-TOP) incorrectly into the sentence. It

indicates that we need a highly accurate recogni-
tion of the modalities of sentences for more correct
completion of the antecedent of zero pronouns. In
the ‘unchanged’ case, the translation results are the
same. However, the alignment of the right-hand is
more correct than one of the left-hand.
