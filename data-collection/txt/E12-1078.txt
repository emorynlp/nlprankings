Abstract

We compare the impact of sentence-
internal vs. sentence-external features on
word order prediction in two generation
settings: starting out from a discrimina-
tive surface realisation ranking model for
an LFG grammar of German, we enrich
the feature set with lexical chain features
from the discourse context which can be
robustly detected and reflect rough gram-
matical correlates of notions from theoreti-
cal approaches to discourse coherence. In a
more controlled setting, we develop a con-
stituent ordering classifier that is trained
on a German treebank with gold corefer-
ence annotation. Surprisingly, in both set-
tings, the sentence-external features per-
form poorly compared to the sentence-
internal ones, and do not improve over
a baseline model capturing the syntactic
functions of the constituents.

1 Introduction

The task of surface realization, especially in a rel-
atively free word order language like German, is
only partially determined by hard syntactic con-
straints. The space of alternative realizations that
are strictly speaking grammatical is typically con-
siderable. Nevertheless, for any given choice of
lexical items and prior discourse context, only a
few realizations will come across as natural and
will contribute to a coherent text. Hence, any NLP
application involving a non-trivial generation step
is confronted with the issue of soft constraints on
grammatical alternatives in one way or another.

There are countless approaches to modelling
these soft constraints, taking into account their
interaction with various aspects of the discourse

context (givenness or salience of particular refer-
ents, prior mentioning of particular concepts).

Since so many factors are involved and there is
further interaction with subtle semantic and prag-
matic differentiations, lexical choice, stylistics
and presumably processing factors, theoretical ac-
counts making reliable predictions for real cor-
pus examples have for a long time proven elusive.
As for German, only quite recently, a number of
corpus-based studies (Filippova and Strube, 2007;
Speyer, 2005; Dipper and Zinsmeister, 2009) have
made some good progress towards a coherence-
oriented account of at least the left edge of the
German clause structure, the Vorfeld constituent.

What makes the technological application of
theoretical insights even harder is that for most
relevant factors, automatic recognition cannot be
performed with high accuracy (e.g., a coreference
accuracy in the 70’s means there is a good deal
of noise) and for the higher-level notions such
as the information-structural focus, interannotator
agreement on real corpus data tends to be much
lower than for core-grammatical notions (Poesio
and Artstein, 2005; Ritz et al., 2008).

On the other hand, many of the relevant dis-
course factors are reflected indirectly in proper-
ties of the sentence-internal material. Most no-
tably, knowing the shape of referring expressions
narrows down many aspects of givenness and
salience of its referent; pronominal realizations
indicate givenness, and in German there are even
two variants of the personal pronoun (er and der)
for distinguishing salience. So, if the genera-
tion task is set in such a way that the actual lex-
ical choice, including functional categories such
as determiners, is fully fixed (which is of course
not always the case), one can take advantage of

767



these reflexes. This explains in part the fairly high
baseline performance of n-gram language mod-
els in the surface realization task. And the effect
can indeed be taken much further: the discrimi-
native training experiments of Cahill and Riester
(2009) show how effective it is to systematically
take advantage of asymmetry patterns in the mor-
phosyntactic reflexes of the discourse notion of
information status (i.e., using a feature set with
well-chosen purely sentence-bound features).

These observations give rise to the question: in
the light of the difficulty in obtaining reliable dis-
course information on the one hand and the effec-
tiveness of exploiting the reflexes of discourse in
the sentence-internal material on the other – can
we nevertheless expect to gain something from
adding sentence-external feature information?

We propose two scenarios for adressing this
question: first, we choose an approximative ac-
cess to context information and relations between
discourse referents – lexical reiteration of head
words, combined with information about their
grammatical relation and topological positioning
in prior sentences. We apply these features in a
rich sentence-internal surface realisation ranking
model for German. Secondly, we choose a more
controlled scenario: we train a constituent order-
ing classifier based on a feature model that cap-
tures properties of discourse referents in terms of
manually annotated coreference relations. As we
get the same effect in both setups – the sentence-
external features do not improve over a baseline
that captures basic morphosyntactic properties of
the constituents – we conclude that sentence-
internal realisation is actually a relatively accurate
predictor of discourse context, even more accurate
than information that can be obtained from coref-
erence and lexical chain relations.

2 Related Work

In the generation literature, most works on ex-
ploiting sentence-external discourse information
are set in a summarisation or content ordering
framework. Barzilay and Lee (2004) propose an
account for constraints on topic selection based on
probabilistic content models. Barzilay and Lapata
(2008) propose an entity grid model which repre-
sents the distribution of referents in a discourse
for sentence ordering. Karamanis et al. (2009)
use Centering-based metrics to assess coherence
in an information ordering system. Clarke and La-

pata (2010) have improved a sentence compres-
sion system by capturing prominence of phrases
or referents in terms of lexical chain information
inspired by Morris and Hirst (1991) and Center-
ing (Grosz et al., 1995). In their system, discourse
context is represented in terms of hard constraints
modelling whether a certain constituent can be
deleted or not.

In the linearisation or surface realisation do-
main, there is a considerable body of work ap-
proximating information structure in terms of
sentence-internal realisation (Ringger et al., 2004;
Filippova and Strube, 2009; Velldal and Oepen,
2005; Cahill et al., 2007). Cahill and Riester
(2009) improve realisation ranking for German –
which mainly deals with word order variation – by
representing precedence patterns of constituents
in terms of asymmetries in their morphosyntac-
tic properties. As a simple example, a pattern ex-
ploited by Cahill and Riester (2009) is the ten-
dency of definite elements tend to precede indef-
inites, which, on a discourse level, reflects that
given entities in a sentence tend to precede new
entities.

Other work on German surface realisation has
highlighted the role of the initial position in the
German sentence, the so-called Vorfeld (or “pre-
field”). Filippova and Strube (2007) show that
once the Vorfeld (i.e. the constituent that precedes
the finite verb) is correctly determined, the pre-
diction of the order in the Mittelfeld (i.e. the con-
stituents that follow the finite verb) is very easy.
Cheung and Penn (2010) extend the approach
of Filippova and Strube (2007) and augment a
sentence-internal constituent ordering model with
sentence-external features inspired from the en-
tity grid model proposed by Barzilay and Lapata
(2008).

3 Motivation

While there would be many ways to construe
or represent discourse context (e.g. in terms of
the global discourse or information structure), we
concentrate on capturing local coherence through
the distribution of discourse referents in a text.
These discourse referents basically correspond to
the constituents that our surface realisation model
has to put in the right order. As the order of refer-
ents or constituents is arguably influenced by the
information structure of a sentence given the pre-
vious text, our main assumption was that infor-

mation about the prior mentioning of a referent
would be helpful for predicting the position of this
referent in a sentence.

The idea that the occurence of discourse refer-
ents in a text is a central aspect of discourse struc-
ture has been systematically pursued by Centering
Theory (Grosz et al., 1995). Its most important
notions are related to the realisation of discourse
referents (i.e. described as “centers”) and the way
the centers are arranged in a sequence of utter-
ances to make this sequence a coherent discourse.
Another important concept is the “ranking” of dis-
course referents which basically determines the
prominence of a referent in a certain sentence and
is driven by several factors (e.g. their grammati-
cal function). For free word order languages like
German, word order has been proposed as one of
the factors that account for the ranking (Poesio et
al., 2004). In a similar spirit, Morris and Hirst
(1991) have proposed that chains of (related) lex-
ical items in a text are an important indicator of
text structure.

Our main hypothesis was that it is possible to
exploit these intuitions from Centering Theory
and the idea of lexical chains for word order pre-
diction. Thus, we expected that it would be easier
to predict the position of a referent in a sentence
if we have not only given its realisation in the cur-
rent utterance but also its prominence in the previ-
ous discourse. Especially, we expected this intu-
ition to hold for cases where the morpho-syntactic
realisation of a constituent does not provide many
clues. This is illustrated in Examples (1) and (2)
which both exemplify the reiteration of a lexical
item in two subsequent sentences, (reiteration is
one type of lexical chain discussed in Morris and
Hirst (1991)). In Example (1), the second instance

of the noun ‘group’ is modified by a demonstra-
tive pronoun such that its “known” and prominent
discourse status is overt in the morpho-syntactic
realisation. In Example (2), both instances of
“Belgium” are realised as bare proper nouns with-
out an overt morphosyntactic clue indicating their
discourse status.

Beyond the simple presence of reitered items in
sequences of sentences, we expected that it would
be useful to look at the position and syntactic
function of the previous mentions of a discourse
referent. In Example (1), the reiterated item is first
introduced in an embedded sentence and realised
in the Vorfeld in the second utterance. In terms
of centering, this transition would correspond to
a topic shift. In Example (2), both instances are
realised in the Vorfeld, such that the topic of the
first sentence is carried over to the next.

In Example (3), we illustrate a further type of
lexical reiteration. In this case, two identical head
nouns are realised in subsequent sentences, even
though they refer to two different discourse refer-
ents. While this type of lexical chain is described
as “reiteration without identity of referents” by
Morris and Hirst (1991), it would not be captured
in Centering since this is not a case of strict coref-
erence. On the other hand, lexical chains do not
capture types of reiterated discourse referents that
have distinct morpho-syntactic realisations, e.g.
nouns and pronouns.

Originally, we had the hypothesis that strict
corefence information is more useful and accurate
for word order prediction than rather loose lexi-
cal chains which conflate several types of referen-
tial and lexical relations. However, the advantage
of chains, especially chains of reiteration, is that
they can be easily detected in any corpus text and

769



that they might capture “topics” of sentences be-
yond the identity of referents. Thus, we started
out from the idea of lexical chains and added cor-
responding features in a statistical ranking model
for surface realisation of German (Section 4). As
this strategy did not work out, we wanted to assess
whether an ideal coreference annotation would be
helpful at all for predicting word order. In a sec-
ond experiment, we use a corpus which is manu-
ally annotated for coreference (Section 5).

4 Experiment 1: Realisation Ranking
with Lexical Chains

In this Section, we present an experiment that in-
vestigates sentence-external context in a surface
realisation task. The sentence-external context is
represented in terms of lexical chain features and
compared to sentence-internal models which are
based on morphosyntactic features. The experi-
ment thus targets a generation scenario where no
coreference information is available and aims at
assessing whether relatively naive context infor-
mation is also useful.

4.1 System Description

We carry out our first experiment in a regener-
ation set-up with two components: a) a large-
scale hand-crafted Lexical Functional Grammar
(LFG) for German (Rohrer and Forst, 2006), used
to parse and regenerate a corpus sentence, b)
a stochastic ranker that selects the most appro-
priate regenerated sentence in context according
to an underlying, linguistically motivated feature
model. In contrast to fully statistical linearisation
methods, our system first generates the full set
of sentences that correspond to the grammatically
well-formed realisations of the intermediate syn-
tactic representation.1 This representation is an
f-structure, which underspecifies the order of con-
stituents and, to some extent, their morphological
realisation, such that the output sentences contain
all possible combinations of word order permu-
tations and morphological variants. Depending
on the length and structure of the original corpus
sentence, the set of regenerated sentences can be
huge (see Cahill et al. (2007) for details on regen-
erating the German treebank TIGER).

1There are occasional mistakes in the grammar which
sometimes lead to ungrammatical strings being generated,
but this is rare.

The realisation ranking component is an SVM
ranking model implemented with SVMrank,
a Support Vector Machine-based learning tool
(Joachims, 2006). During training, each sentence
is annotated with a rank and a set of features ex-
tracted from the F-structure, its surface string and
external resources (e.g. a language model). If
the sentence matches the original corpus string,
its rank will be highest, the assumption being that
the original sentence corresponds to the optimal
realisation in context. The output of generation,
the top-ranked sentence, is evaluated against the
original corpus sentence.

4.2 The Feature Models
As the aim of this experiment is to better un-
derstand the nature of sentence-internal features
reflecting discourse context and compare them
to sentence-external ones, we build several fea-
ture models which capture different aspects of the
constituents in a given sentence. The sentence-
internal features describe the morphosyntacic re-
alisation of constituents, for instance their func-
tion (“subject”, “object”), and can be straightfor-
wardly extracted from the f-structure. These fea-
tures are then combined into discriminative prece-
dence features, for instance “subject-precedes-
object”. We implement the following types of
morphosyntactic features:

• syntactic function (arguments and adjuncts)
• modification (e.g. nouns modified by relative

clauses, genitive etc.)
• syntactic category (e.g. adverbs, proper

nouns, phrasal arguments)
• definiteness for nouns
• number and person for nominal elements
• types of pronouns (e.g. demonstrative, re-

flexive)
• constituent span and number of embedded

nodes in the tree

In addition, we also include language model
scores in our ranking model. In Section 4.4,
we report on results for several subsets of these
features where “BaseSyn” refers to a model that
only includes the syntactic function features and
“FullMorphSyn” includes all features mentioned
above.

For extracting the lexical chains, we check for
any overlapping nouns in the n sentences previ-
ous to the current one being generated. We check

Figure 1: Made-up training example for realisation ranking with precedence features

proper and common nouns, considering full and
partial overlaps as shown in Examples (1) and
(2), where the (a) example is the previous sen-
tence in the corpus. For each overlap, we record
the following properties: (i) function in the previ-
ous sentence, (ii) position in the previous sentence
(e.g. Vorfeld), (iii) distance between sentences,
(iv) total number of overlaps.

These overlap features are then also
combined in terms of precedence, e.g.
“has subject overlap:3-precedes-no overlap”,
meaning that in the current sentence a noun
that was previously mentioned in a subject 3
sentences ago precedes a noun that was not
mentioned before.

In Figure 1, we give an example of a set of gen-
eration alternatives and their (partial) feature rep-
resentation for the sentence (1-b). Precedence is
indicated by ”<”.

Basically, our sentence-external feature model
is built on the intuition that lexical chains or over-
laps approximate discourse status in a way which
is similar to sentence-internal morphosyntactic
properties. Thus, we would expect that overlaps
indicate givenness, salience or prominence and
that asymmetries between overlapping and non-
overlapping entities are helpful in the ranking.

4.3 Data
All our models are trained on 7,039 sentences
(subdivided into 1259 texts) from the TIGER
Treebank of German newspaper text (Brants et al.,
2002). We tune the parameters of our SVM model
on a development set of 55 sentences and report
the final results for our unseen test set of 240 sen-
tences. Table 1 shows how many sentences in our
training, development and test sets have at least
one textually overlapping phrase in the previous
1–10 sentences.

We choose the TIGER treebank, which has no

Table 1: The percentage of sentences that have at least

coreference annotation, since we already have a
number of resources available to match the syn-
tactic analyses produced by our grammar against
the analyses in the treebank. Thus, in our regen-
eration system, we parse the sentences with the
grammar, and choose the parsed f-structures that
are compatible with the manual annotation in the
TIGER treebank as is done in Cahill et al. (2007).
This compatibility check eliminates noise which
would be introduced by generating from incorrect
parses (e.g. incorrect PP-attachments typically re-
sult in unnatural and non-equivalent surface reali-
sations).

For comparing the string chosen by the mod-
els against the original corpus sentence, we use
BLEU, NIST and exact match. Exact match is
a strict measure that only credits the system if it
chooses the exact same string as the original cor-
pus string. BLEU and NIST are more relaxed
measures that compare the strings on the n-gram
level. Finally, we report accuracy scores for the
Vorfeld position (VF) corresponding to the per-
centage of sentences generated with a correct Vor-
feld.

4.4 Results

In Table 2, we report the performance of the full
sentence-internal feature model combined with
context windows from zero to ten. The scores
have been obtained from tenfold-crossvalidation.
For none of the context windows, the model out-
performs the baseline with a zero context which
has no sentence-external features. In Table 3,
we compare the performance of several feature
models corresponding to subsets of the features
used so far which are combined with sentence-
external features respectively. We note that the
function precedence features (i.e. the ‘BaseSyn’
model) are very powerful, leading to a major im-
provement compared to a language model. The
sentence-external features lead to an improvement
when combined with the language-model based
ranking. However, this improvement is leveled
out in the BaseSyn model.

On the one hand, the fact that the lexical chain
features improve a language-model based ranking
suggests these features are, to some extent, pre-
dictive for certain patterns of German word order.
On the other hand, the fact that they don’t improve
over an informed sentence-internal baseline sug-
gests that these patterns are equally well captured

by morphosyntactic features. However, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the chain features are
too noisy as they conflate several types of lexical
and coreferential relations. This will be adressed
in the following experiment.

5 Experiment 2: Constituent Ordering
with Centering-inspired Features

We now look at a simpler generation setup where
we concentrate on the ordering of constituents in
the German Vorfeld and Mittelfeld. This strat-
egy has also been adopted in previous investiga-
tions of German word order: Filippova and Strube
(2007) show that once the German Vorfeld is cor-
rectly chosen, the prediction accuracy for the Mit-
telfeld (the constituents following the finite verb)
is in the 90s.

In order to eliminate noise introduced from po-
tentially heterogeneous chain features, we look at
coreference features and, again, compare them to
sentence-internal morphosyntactic features. We
target a generation scenario where coreference in-
formation is available. The aim is to establish an
upper bound concerning the quality improvement
for word order prediction by recurring to manual
corefence annotation.

5.1 Data and Setup

We carry out the constituent ordering experiment
on the Tüba-D/Z treebank (v5) of German news-
paper articles (Telljohann et al., 2006). It com-
prises about 800k tokens in 45k sentences. We
choose this corpus because it is not only annotated
with syntactic analyses but also with coreference
relations (Naumann, 2006). The syntactic annota-
tion format differs from the TIGER treebank used
in the previous experiment, for instance, it ex-
plicitely represents the Vorfeld and Mittelfeld as
phrasal nodes in the tree. This format is very con-
venient for the extraction of constituents in the re-
spective positions.

The Tüba-D/Z coreference annotation distin-
guishes several relations between discourse ref-
erents, most importantly “coreferential relation”
and “anaphoric relation” where the first denotes
a relation between noun phrases that refer to the
same entity, and the latter refers to a link between
a pronoun and a contextual antecedent, see Nau-
mann (2006) for further detail. We expected the
coreferential relation to be particularly useful, as

772



it cannot always be read off the morphosyntac-
tic realisation of a noun phrase, whereas pronouns
are almost always used in an anaphoric relation.

The constituent ordering model is implemented
as a classifier that is given a set of constituents
and predicts the constituent that is most likely to
be realised in the Vorfeld.

The set of candidate constituents is determined
from the tree of the original corpus sentence. We
will assume that all constituents under a Vorfeld
and Mittelfeld node can be freely reordered. Thus,
we do not check whether the word order variants
we look at are actually grammatical assuming that
most of them are. In this sense, this experiment
is close to fully statistical generation approaches.
As a further simplification, we do not look at mor-
phological generation variants of the constituents
or their head verb.

The classifier is implemented with SVMrank
again. In contrast to the previous experiment
where we learned to rank sentences, the classi-
fier now learns to rank constituents. The con-
stituents have been extracted using the tool de-
scribed in Bouma (2010). The final data set com-
prises 48.513 candidate sets of freely orderable
constituents.

5.2 Centering-inspired Feature Model

To compare the discourse context model against a
sentence-based model, we implemented a number
of sentence-internal features that are very similar
to the features used in the previous experiment.
Since we extract them from the syntactic annota-
tion instead of f-structures, some labels and fea-
ture names will be different, however, the design
of the sentence-internal model is identical to the
previous one in Section 4.

The sentence-external features differ in some
aspects from Section 4, since we extract coref-
erence relations of several types (see (Naumann,
2006) for the anaphoric relations annotated in the
Tueba-D/Z). For each type of coreference link,
we extract the following properties: (i) function
of the antecedent, (ii) position of the antecedent,
(iii) distance between sentences, (iv) type of rela-
tion. We also distinguish coreference links anno-
tated for the whole phrase (“head link”) and links
that are annotated for an element embedded by the
constituent (“contained link”). The two types are
illustrated in Examples (4) and (5). Note that both
cases would not have been captured in the lexical

Coref Link 30.5% 23.4%

Table 4: Backward and forward centers and their posi-
tions

chain model since there is no lexical overlap be-
tween the realisations of the discourse referents.

These types of coreference features implicitly
carry the information that would also be consid-
ered in a Centering formalisation of discourse
context. In addition to these, we designed features
that explicitly describe centers as these might
have a higher weight. In line with Clarke and
Lapata (2010), we compute backward (CB) and
forward centers (CF ) in the following way:

1. Extract all entities from the current sentence
and the previous sentence.

2. Rank the entities of the previous sentence ac-
cording to their function (subject < direct
object < indirect object ...).

3. Find the highest ranked entity in the previous
sentence that has a link to an entity in the
current sentence, this entity is the CB of the
sentence.

In the same way, we mark entities as forward
centers that are ranked highest in the current sen-
tence and have a link to an entity in the following
sentence.2 In Table 4, we report the percentage of
sentences that have backward and forward centers
in the Vorfeld or Mittelfeld. While the percentage
of sentences that realise a backward center is quite
low, the overall proportion of sentences contain-
ing some type of coreference link is in a dimen-
sion such that the learner could definitely pick up
some predictive patterns. Going by the relative
frequencies, coreferential constituents have a bias
towards appearing in the Vorfeld rather than in the

5.3 Results

First, we build three coreference-based con-
stituent classifiers on their entire training set and
compare them to their sentence-internal baseline.
The most simple baseline records the category of

2In Centering, all entities in a given utterance can be seen
as forward centers, however we thought that this implemen-
tation would be more useful.

the constituent head and the number of words that
the constituent spans. Additionally, in parallel to
the experiment in Section 4, we build a “BaseSyn”
model which has the syntactic function features,
and a “FullMorphSyn” model which comprises
the entire set of sentence-internal features. To
each of these baseline, we add the coreference
features. The results are reported in Table 5.

In this experiment, we find an effect of
the sentence-external features over the simple
sentence-internal baselines. However, in the fully
spelled-out, sentence-internal model, the effect
is, again, minimal. Moreover, for each base-
line, we obtain higher improvements by adding
further sentence-internal features than by adding
sentence-external ones the accuracy of the sim-
ple baseline (47.48%) improves by 7.34 points
through adding function features (the accuracy
of BaseSyn is 54.82%) and by only 3.48 points
through adding coreference features.

We run a second experiment in order to so see
whether the better performance of the sentence-
internal features is related to their coverage. We
build and evaluate the same set of classifiers on
the subset of sentences that contain at least one
coreference link for one of its constituents (see
Table 4 for the distribution of coreference links
in our data). The results are given in Table 6. In
this experiment, the coreference features improve
over all sentence-internal baselines including the
‘FullMorphSyn’ model.

5.4 Discussion

The results presented in this Section consis-
tently complete the picture that emerged from
the experiments in Section 4. Even if we have
high quality information about discourse con-
text in terms of relations between referents, a
non-trivial sentence-internal model for word or-
der prediction can be hardly improved. This
suggests that sentence-internal approximations of
discourse context provide a fairly good way of
dealing with local coherence in a linearisation
task. It is also interesting that the sentence-
external features improve over simple baselines,
but get leveled out in rich sentence-internal fea-
ture models. From this, we conclude that the
sentence-external features we implemented are to
some extent predictive for word order, but that
they can be covered by sentence-internal features
as well.

Our second evaluation concentrating on the
sentences that have coreference information
shows that the better performance of the sentence-
internal features is also related to their cover-
age. These results confirm our initial intuition
that coreference information can add to the pre-
dictive power of the morpho-syntactic features in
certain contexts. This positive effect disappears
when sentences with and without coreferential
constituents are taken together. For future work,
it would be promising to investigate whether the

positive impact of coreference features can be
strengthened if the coreference annotation scheme
is more exhaustive, including, e.g., bridging and
event anaphora.

6 Conclusion

We have carried out a number of experiments that
show that sentence-internal models for word order
are hardly improved by features which explicitely
represent the preceding context of a sentence in
terms of lexical and referential relations between
discourse entities. This suggests that sentence-
internal realisation implicitly carries a lot of im-
formation about discourse context. On average,
the morphosyntactic properties of constituents in
a text are better approximates of their discourse
status than actual coreference relations.

This result feeds into a number of research
questions concerning the representation of dis-
course and its application in generation systems.
Although we should certainly not expect a com-
putational model to achieve a perfect accuracy in
the constituent ordering task – even humans only
agree to a certain extent in rating word order vari-
ants (Belz and Reiter, 2006; Cahill, 2009) – the
average accuracy in the 60’s for prediction of Vor-
feld occupance is still moderate. An obvious di-
rection would be to further investigate more com-
plex representations of discourse that take into ac-
count the relations between utterances, such as
topic shifts. Moreover, it is not clear whether the
effects we find for linearisation in this paper carry
over to other levels of generation such as tacti-
cal generation where syntactic functions are not
fully specified. In a broader perspective, our re-
sults underline the need for better formalisations
of discourse that can be translated into features for
large-scale applications such as generation.
