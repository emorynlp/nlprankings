Abstract

In this paper, we describe our system
which participated in the SemEval 2010
task of disambiguating sentiment ambigu-
ous adjectives for Chinese. Our system
uses text messages from Twitter, a popu-
lar microblogging platform, for building a
dataset of emotional texts. Using the built
dataset, the system classifies the meaning
of adjectives into positive or negative sen-
timent polarity according to the given con-
text. Our approach is fully automatic. It
does not require any additional hand-built
language resources and it is language in-
dependent.

1 Introduction

The dataset of the SemEval task (Wu and Jin,
2010) consists of short texts in Chinese contain-
ing target adjectives whose sentiments need to be
disambiguated in the given contexts. Those adjec-
tives are: 大 big, 小 small, 多 many, 少 few, 高
high, 低 low,厚 thick, 薄 thin, 深 deep, shallow,
重 heavy, light,巨大 huge,重大 grave.

Disambiguating sentiment ambiguous adjec-
tives is a challenging task for NLP. Previous stud-
ies were mostly focused on word sense disam-
biguation rather than sentiment disambiguation.
Although both problems look similar, the latter is
more challenging in our opinion because impreg-
nated with more subjectivity. In order to solve the
task, one has to deal not only with the semantics
of the context, but also with the psychological as-
pects of human perception of emotions from the
written text.

In our approach, we use Twitter1 microblogging
platform to retrieve emotional messages and form
two sets of texts: messages with positive emotions
and those with negative ones (Pak and Paroubek,

1http://twitter.com

2010). We use emoticons2 as indicators of an emo-
tion (Read, 2005) to automatically classify texts
into positive or negative sets. The reason we use
Twitter is because it allows us to collect the data
with minimal supervision efforts. It provides an
API3 which makes the data retrieval process much
more easier then Web based search or other re-
sources.

After the dataset of emotional texts has been
obtained, we build a classifier based on n-grams
Naı̈ve Bayes approach. We tested two approaches
to build a sentiment classifier:

1. In the first one, we collected Chinese texts
from Twitter and used them to train a classi-
fier to annotate the test dataset.

2. In the second one, we used machine trans-
lator to translate the dataset from Chinese to
English and annotated it using collected En-
glish texts from Twitter as the training data.

We have made the second approach because we
were able to collect much more of English texts
from Twitter than Chinese ones and we wanted
to test the impact of machine translation on the
performance of our classifier. We have exper-
imented with Google Translate and Yahoo Ba-
belfish4. Google Translate yielded better results.

In (Yang et al., 2007), the authors use web-blogs
to construct a corpora for sentiment analysis and
use emotion icons assigned to blog posts as indica-
tors of users’ mood. The authors applied SVM and
CRF learners to classify sentiments at the sentence
level and then investigated several strategies to de-
termine the overall sentiment of the document. As

emotion often used in Internet blogs and textual chats

the result, the winning strategy is defined by con-
sidering the sentiment of the last sentence of the
document as the sentiment at the document level.

J. Read in (Read, 2005) used emoticons such as
“:-)” and “:-(” to form a training set for the sen-
timent classification. For this purpose, the author
collected texts containing emoticons from Usenet
newsgroups. The dataset was divided into “pos-
itive” (texts with happy emoticons) and “nega-
tive” (texts with sad or angry emoticons) samples.
Emoticons-trained classifiers: SVM and Naı̈ve
Bayes, were able to obtain up to 70% accuracy on
the test set.

In (Go et al., 2009), authors used Twitter to
collect training data and then to perform a senti-
ment search. The approach is similar to the one
in (Read, 2005). The authors construct corpora
by using emoticons to obtain “positive” and “neg-
ative” samples, and then use various classifiers.
The best result was obtained by the Naı̈ve Bayes
classifier with a mutual information measure for
feature selection. The authors were able to obtain
up to 84% of accuracy on their test set. However,
the method showed a bad performance with three
classes (“negative”, “positive” and “neutral”).

In our system, we use a similar idea as in (Go
et al., 2009), however, we improve it by using a
combination of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams (
(Go et al., 2009) used only unigrams). We also
handle negations by attaching a negation particle
to adjacent words when forming ngrams.

3 Our method

3.1 Corpus collection

Using Twitter API we collected a corpus of text
posts and formed a dataset of two classes: positive
sentiments and negative sentiments. We queried
Twitter for two types of emoticons considering
eastern and western types of emoticons5:

• Happy emoticons: :-), :), ˆ ˆ, ˆoˆ, etc.
• Sad emoticons: :-(, :(, T T, ; ;, etc.

We were able to obtain 10,000 Twitter posts in
Chinese, and 300,000 posts in English evenly split
between negative and positive classes.

The collected texts were processed as follows to
obtain a set of n-grams:

1. Filtering – we remove URL links (e.g.
http://example.com), Twitter user names (e.g.

5http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon#Asian style

@alex – with symbol @ indicating a
user name), Twitter special words (such as
“RT”6), and emoticons.

2. Tokenization – we segment text by split-
ting it by spaces and punctuation marks, and
form a bag of words. For English, we kept
short forms as a single word: “don’t”, “I’ll”,
“she’d”.

3. Stopwords removal – in English, texts we re-
moved articles (“a”, “an”, “the”) from the bag
of words.

4. N-grams construction – we make a set of n-
grams out of consecutive words.

A negation particle is attached to a word which
precedes it and follows it. For example, a sen-
tence “I do not like fish” will form three bigrams:
“I do+not”, “do+not like”, “not+like fish”. Such
a procedure improves the accuracy of the classi-
fication since the negation plays a special role in
opinion and sentiment expression (Wilson et al.,
2005). In English, we used negative particles ’no’
and ’not’. In Chinese, we used the following par-
ticles:

1. 不 – is not + noun

2. 未 – does not + verb, will not + verb

3. 莫 (別) – do not (imperative)

4. 無 (沒有) – does not have

3.2 Classifier

We build a sentiment classifier using the multi-
nomial Naı̈ve Bayes classifier which is based on
Bayes’ theorem.

P (s|M) = P (s) · P (M |s)
P (M)

(1)

where s is a sentiment, M is a text. We assume
that a target adjective has the same sentiment po-
larity as the whole text, because in general the
lengths of the given texts are small.

Since we have sets of equal number of positive
and negative messages, we simplify the equation:

P (s|M) = P (M |s)
P (M)

(2)

posting of a message

P (s|M) ∼ P (M |s) (3)
We train Bayes classifiers which use a presence

of an n-grams as a binary feature. We have ex-
perimented with unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
Pang et al. (Pang et al., 2002) reported that uni-
grams outperform bigrams when doing sentiment
classification of movie reviews, but Dave et al.
(Dave et al., 2003) have obtained contrary re-
sults: bigrams and trigrams worked better for the
product-review polarity classification. We tried to
determine the best settings for our microblogging
data. On the one hand high-order n-grams, such
as trigrams, should capture patterns of sentiments
expressions better. On the other hand, unigrams
should provide a good coverage of the data. There-
fore we combine three classifiers that are based
on different n-gram orders (unigrams, bigrams and
trigrams). We make an assumption of conditional
independence of n-gram for the calculation sim-
plicity:

P (s|M) ∼ P (G1|s) · P (G2|s) · P (G3|s) (4)

where G1 is a set of unigrams representing the
message, G2 is a set of bigrams, and G3 is a set of
trigrams. We assume that n-grams are condition-
ally independent:

P (Gn|s) =
∏

g∈Gn
P (g|s) (5)

Where Gn is a set of n-grams of order n.

P (s|M) ∼
∏

g∈G1
P (g|s)·

∏
g∈G2

P (g|s)·
∏

g∈G3
P (g|s)

(6)
Finally, we calculate a log-likelihood of each sen-
timent:

L(s|M) =
∑
g∈G1

log(P (g|s)) +
∑
g∈G2

log(P (g|s))

+
∑
g∈G3

log(P (g|s))

(7)

In order to improve the accuracy, we changed
the size of the context window, i.e. the number of
words before and after the target adjective used for
classification.

a test dataset with 2917 sentences. Both datasets
were provided by the task organizers. Micro and
macro accuracy were chosen as the evaluation
metrics.

First, we compared the performance of our
method when using Google Translate and Yahoo
Babelfish for translating the trial dataset. The re-
sults for micro and macro accuracy are shown in
Graphs 1 and 2 respectively. The x-axis repre-
sents a context window-size, equal to a number of
words on both sides of the target adjective. The y-
axis shows accuracy values. From the graphs we
see that Google Translate provides better results,
therefore it was chosen when annotating the test
dataset.

Next, we studied the impact of the context win-
dow size on micro and macro accuracy. The
impact of the size of the context window on
the accuracy of the classifier trained on Chinese
texts is depicted in Graph 3 and for the classifier
trained on English texts with translated test dataset

The second approach achieves better results.

We were able to obtain 64% of macro and 61% of
micro accuracy when using the second approach
but only 63% of macro and 61% of micro accu-
racy when using the first approach.

Another observation from the graphs is that
Chinese requires a smaller size of a context win-
dow to obtain the best performance. For the first
approach, a window size of 8 words gave the best
macro accuracy. For the second approach, we ob-
tained the highest accuracy with a window size of
22 words.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have described our system for
disambiguating sentiments of adjectives in Chi-
nese texts. Our Naı̈ve Bayes approach uses infor-
mation automatically extracted from Twitter mi-

croblogs using emoticons. The techniques used in
our approach can be applied to any other language.
Our system is fully automate and does not utilize
any hand-built lexicon. We were able to achieve
up to 64% of macro and 61% of micro accuracy at
the SemEval 2010 task

For the future work, we would like to collect
more Chinese texts from Twitter or similar mi-
croblogging platforms. We think that increasing
the training dataset will improve much the accu-
racy of the sentiment disambiguation.
