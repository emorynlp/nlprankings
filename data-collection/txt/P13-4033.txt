Abstract

We describe Docent, an open-source de-
coder for statistical machine translation
that breaks with the usual sentence-by-
sentence paradigm and translates complete
documents as units. By taking transla-
tion to the document level, our decoder
can handle feature models with arbitrary
discourse-wide dependencies and consti-
tutes an essential infrastructure compon-
ent in the quest for discourse-aware SMT
models.

1 Motivation

Most of the research on statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) that was conducted during the last
20 years treated every text as a “bag of sentences”
and disregarded all relations between elements in
different sentences. Systematic research into ex-
plicitly discourse-related problems has only begun
very recently in the SMT community (Hardmeier,
2012) with work on topics such as pronominal
anaphora (Le Nagard and Koehn, 2010; Hard-
meier and Federico, 2010; Guillou, 2012), verb
tense (Gong et al., 2012) and discourse connect-
ives (Meyer et al., 2012).

One of the problems that hamper the develop-
ment of cross-sentence models for SMT is the fact
that the assumption of sentence independence is
at the heart of the dynamic programming (DP)
beam search algorithm most commonly used for
decoding in phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn et
al., 2003). For integrating cross-sentence features
into the decoding process, researchers had to adopt
strategies like two-pass decoding (Le Nagard and
Koehn, 2010). We have previously proposed an
algorithm for document-level phrase-based SMT
decoding (Hardmeier et al., 2012). Our decoding
algorithm is based on local search instead of dy-
namic programming and permits the integration of

document-level models with unrestricted depend-
encies, so that a model score can be conditioned on
arbitrary elements occurring anywhere in the input
document or in the translation that is being gen-
erated. In this paper, we present an open-source
implementation of this search algorithm. The de-
coder is written in C++ and follows an object-
oriented design that makes it easy to extend it with
new feature models, new search operations or dif-
ferent types of local search algorithms. The code
is released under the GNU General Public License
and published on Github1 to make it easy for other
researchers to use it in their own experiments.

2 Document-Level Decoding with Local
Search

Our decoder is based on the phrase-based SMT
model described by Koehn et al. (2003) and im-
plemented, for example, in the popular Moses
decoder (Koehn et al., 2007). Translation is
performed by splitting the input sentence into
a number of contiguous word sequences, called
phrases, which are translated into the target lan-
guage through a phrase dictionary lookup and op-
tionally reordered. The choice between different
translations of an ambiguous source phrase and the
ordering of the target phrases are guided by a scor-
ing function that combines a set of scores taken
from the phrase table with scores from other mod-
els such as an n-gram language model. The actual
translation process is realised as a search for the
highest-scoring translation in the space of all the
possible translations that could be generated given
the models.

The decoding approach that is implemented in
Docent was first proposed by Hardmeier et al.
(2012) and is based on local search. This means
that it has a state corresponding to a complete, if
possibly bad, translation of a document at every

stage of the search progress. Search proceeds by
making small changes to the current search state in
order to transform it gradually into a better trans-
lation. This differs from the DP algorithm used in
other decoders, which starts with an empty trans-
lation and expands it bit by bit. It is similar to
previous work on phrase-based SMT decoding by
Langlais et al. (2007), but enables the creation of
document-level models, which was not addressed
by earlier approaches.

Docent currently implements two search al-
gorithms that are different generalisations of the
hill climbing local search algorithm by Hardmeier
et al. (2012). The original hill climbing algorithm
starts with an initial state and generates possible
successor states by randomly applying simple ele-
mentary operations to the state. After each op-
eration, the new state is scored and accepted if
its score is better than that of the previous state,
else rejected. Search terminates when the decoder
cannot find an acceptable successor state after a
certain number of attempts, or when a maximum
number of steps is reached.

Simulated annealing is a stochastic variant of
hill climbing that always accepts moves towards
better states, but can also accept moves towards
lower-scoring states with a certain probability that
depends on a temperature parameter in order to
escape local maxima. Local beam search gener-
alises hill climbing in a different way by keeping
a beam of a fixed number of multiple states at any
time and randomly picking a state from the beam
to modify at each move. The original hill climb-
ing procedure can be recovered as a special case
of either one of these search algorithms, by call-
ing simulated annealing with a fixed temperature
of 0 or local beam search with a beam size of 1.

Initial states for the search process can be gen-
erated either by selecting a random segmentation
with random translations from the phrase table in
monotonic order, or by running DP beam search
with sentence-local models as a first pass. For
the second option, which generally yields better
search results, Docent is linked with the Moses
decoder and makes direct calls to the DP beam
search algorithm implemented by Moses. In addi-
tion to these state initialisation procedures, Docent
can save a search state to a disk file which can be
loaded again in a subsequent decoding pass. This
saves time especially when running repeated ex-
periments from the same starting point obtained

by DP search.
In order to explore the complete search space

of phrase-based SMT, the search operations in a
local search decoder must be able to change the
phrase translations, the order of the output phrases
and the segmentation of the source sentence into
phrases. The three operations used by Hardmeier
et al. (2012), change-phrase-translation, reseg-
ment and swap-phrases, jointly meet this require-
ment and are all implemented in Docent. Addi-
tionally, Docent features three extra operations, all
of which affect the target word order: The move-
phrases operation moves a phrase to another loca-
tion in the sentence. Unlike swap-phrases, it does
not require that another phrase be moved in the
opposite direction at the same time. A pair of
operations called permute-phrases and linearise-
phrases can reorder a sequence of phrases into ran-
dom order and back into the order corresponding
to the source language.

Since the search algorithm in Docent is
stochastic, repeated runs of the decoder will gen-
erally produce different output. However, the vari-
ance of the output is usually small, especially
when initialising with a DP search pass, and it
tends to be lower than the variance introduced
by feature weight tuning (Hardmeier et al., 2012;
Stymne et al., 2013a).

3 Available Feature Models

In its current version, Docent implements a selec-
tion of sentence-local feature models that makes
it possible to build a baseline system with a con-
figuration comparable to that of a typical Moses
baseline system. The published source code
also includes prototype implementations of a few
document-level models. These models should be
considered work in progress and serve as a demon-
stration of the cross-sentence modelling capabilit-
ies of the decoder. They have not yet reached a
state of maturity that would make them suitable
for production use.

The sentence-level models provided by Docent
include the phrase table, n-gram language models
implemented with the KenLM toolkit (Heafield,
2011), an unlexicalised distortion cost model with
geometric decay (Koehn et al., 2003) and a word
penalty cost. All of these features are designed
to be compatible with the corresponding features
in Moses. From among the typical set of baseline
features in Moses, we have not implemented the

194



lexicalised distortion model, but this model could
easily be added if required. Docent uses the same
binary file format for phrase tables as Moses, so
the same training apparatus can be used.

DP-based SMT decoders have a parameter
called distortion limit that limits the difference in
word order between the input and the MT out-
put. In DP search, this is formally considered to
be a parameter of the search algorithm because it
affects the algorithmic complexity of the search
by controlling how many translation options must
be considered at each hypothesis expansion. The
stochastic search algorithm in Docent does not re-
quire this limitation, but it can still be useful be-
cause the standard models of SMT do not model
long-distance reordering well. Docent therefore
includes a separate indicator feature to indicate
a violated distortion limit. In conjunction with a
very large weight, this feature can effectively en-
sure that the distortion limit is enforced. In con-
trast with the distortion limit parameter of a DP de-
coder, the weight of our distortion limit feature can
potentially be tuned to permit occasional distor-
tion limit violations when they contribute to better
translations.

The document-level models included in Docent
include a length parity model, a semantic lan-
guage model as well as a collection of document-
level readability models. The length parity model
is a proof-of-concept model that ensures that all
sentences in a document have either consistently
odd or consistently even length. It serves mostly as
a template to demonstrate how a simple document-
level model can be implemented in the decoder.
The semantic language model was originally pro-
posed by Hardmeier et al. (2012) to improve lex-
ical cohesion in a document. It is a cross-sentence
model over sequences of content words that are
scored based on their similarity in a word vector
space. The readability models serve to improve
the readability of the translation by encouraging
the selection of easier and more consistent target
words. They are described and demonstrated in
more detail in section 5.

Docent can read input files both in the NIST-
XML format commonly used to encode docu-
ments in MT shared tasks such as NIST or WMT
and in the more elaborate MMAX format (Müller
and Strube, 2003). The MMAX format makes
it possible to include a wide range of discourse-
level corpus annotations such as coreference links.

These annotations can then be accessed by the
feature models. To allow for additional target-
language information such as morphological fea-
tures of target words, Docent can handle simple
word-level annotations that are encoded in the
phrase table in the same way as target language
factors in Moses.

In order to optimise feature weights we have
adapted the Moses tuning infrastructure to Do-
cent. In this way we can take advantage of all its
features, for instance using different optimisation
algorithms such as MERT (Och, 2003) or PRO
(Hopkins and May, 2011), and selective tuning of
a subset of features. Since document features only
give meaningful scores on the document level and
not on the sentence level, we naturally perform
optimisation on document level, which typically
means that we need more data than for the op-
timisation of sentence-based decoding. The res-
ults we obtain are relatively stable and competit-
ive with sentence-level optimisation of the same
models (Stymne et al., 2013a).

4 Implementing Feature Models
Efficiently

While translating a document, the local search de-
coder attempts to make a great number of moves.
For each move, a score must be computed and
tested against the acceptance criterion. An over-
whelming majority of the proposed moves will be
rejected. In order to achieve reasonably fast de-
coding times, efficient scoring is paramount. Re-
computing the scores of the whole document at
every step would be far too slow for the decoder
to be useful. Fortunately, score computation can
be sped up in two ways. Knowledge about how
the state to be scored was generated from its pre-
decessor helps to limit recomputations to a min-
imum, and by adopting a two-step scoring proced-
ure that just computes the scores that can be calcu-
lated with little effort at first, we need to compute
the complete score only if the new state has some
chance of being accepted.

The scores of SMT feature models can usu-
ally be decomposed in some way over parts of
the document. The traditional models borrowed
from sentence-based decoding are necessarily de-
composable at the sentence level, and in practice,
all common models are designed to meet the con-
straints of DP beam search, which ensures that
they can in fact be decomposed over even smal-

195



ler sequences of just a few words. For genuine
document-level features, this is not the case, but
even these models can often be decomposed in
some way, for instance over paragraphs, anaphoric
links or lexical chains. To take advantage of this
fact, feature models in Docent always have access
to the previous state and its score and to a list of
the state modifications that transform the previous
state into the next. The scores of the new state are
calculated by identifying the parts of a document
that are affected by the modifications, subtract-
ing the old scores of this part from the previous
score and adding the new scores. This approach
to scoring makes feature model implementation
a bit more complicated than in DP search, but it
gives the feature models full control over how they
decompose a document while still permitting effi-
cient decoding.

A feature model class in Docent implements
three methods. The initDocument method is called
once per document when decoding starts. It
straightforwardly computes the model score for
the entire document from scratch. When a state
is modified, the decoder first invokes the estim-
ateScoreUpdate method. Rather than calculating
the new score exactly, this method is only required
to return an upper bound that reflects the max-
imum score that could possibly be achieved by this
state. The search algorithm then checks this upper
bound against the acceptance criterion. Only if the
upper bound meets the criterion does it call the
updateScore method to calculate the exact score,
which is then checked against the acceptance cri-
terion again.

The motivation for this two-step procedure is
that some models can compute an upper bound ap-
proximation much more efficiently than an exact
score. For any model whose score is a log probab-
ility, a value of 0 is a loose upper bound that can
be returned instantly, but in many cases, we can do
much better. In the case of the n-gram language
model, for instance, a more accurate upper bound
can be computed cheaply by subtracting from the
old score all log-probabilities of n-grams that are
affected by the state modifications without adding
the scores of the n-grams replacing them in the
new state. This approximation can be calculated
without doing any language model lookups at all.
On the other hand, some models like the distor-
tion cost or the word penalty are very cheap to
compute, so that the estimateScoreUpdate method

can simply return the precise score as a tight up-
per bound. If a state gets rejected because of a
low score on one of the cheap models, this means
we will never have to compute the more expensive
feature scores at all.

5 Readability: A Case Study

As a case study we report initial results on how
document-wide features can be used in Docent in
order to improve the readability of texts by encour-
aging simple and consistent terminology (Stymne
et al., 2013b). This work is a first step towards
achieving joint SMT and text simplification, with
the final goal of adapting MT to user groups such
as people with reading disabilities.

Lexical consistency modelling for SMT has
been attempted before. The suggested approaches
have been limited by the use of sentence-level
decoders, however, and had to resort to proced-
ures like post processing (Carpuat, 2009), multiple
decoding runs with frozen counts from previous
runs (Ture et al., 2012), or cache-based models
(Tiedemann, 2010). In Docent, however, we al-
ways have access to a full document translation,
which makes it straightforward to include features
directly into the decoder.

We implemented four features on the document
level. The first two features are type token ra-
tio (TTR) and a reformulation of it, OVIX, which
is less sensitive to text length. These ratios have
been related to the “idea density” of a text (Müh-
lenbock and Kokkinakis, 2009). We also wanted
to encourage consistent translations of words, for
which we used the Q-value (Deléger et al., 2006),
which has been proposed to measure term qual-
ity. We applied it on word level (QW) and phrase
level (QP). These features need access to the full
target document, which we have in Docent. In ad-
dition, we included two sentence-level count fea-
tures for long words that have been used to meas-
ure the readability of Swedish texts (Mühlenbock
and Kokkinakis, 2009).

We tested our features on English–Swedish
translation using the Europarl corpus. For train-
ing we used 1,488,322 sentences. As test data, we
extracted 20 documents with a total of 690 sen-
tences. We used the standard set of baseline fea-
tures: 5-gram language model, translation model
with 5 weights, a word penalty and a distortion
penalty.

Table 1: Results for adding single lexical consist-
ency features to Docent

To evaluate our system we used the BLEU score
(Papineni et al., 2002) together with a set of read-
ability metrics, since readability is what we hoped
to improve by adding consistency features. Here
we used OVIX to confirm a direct impact on con-
sistency, and LIX (Björnsson, 1968), which is a
common readability measure for Swedish. Unfor-
tunately we do not have access to simplified trans-
lated text, so we calculate the MT metrics against a
standard reference, which means that simple texts
will likely have worse scores than complicated
texts closer to the reference translation.

We tuned the standard features using Moses and
MERT, and then added each lexical consistency
feature with a small weight, using a grid search ap-
proach to find values with a small impact. The res-
ults are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, for in-
dividual features the translation quality was main-
tained, with small improvements in LIX, and in
OVIX for the TTR and OVIX features. For the
combination we lost a little bit on translation qual-
ity, but there was a larger effect on the readability
metrics. When we used larger weights, there was
a bigger impact on the readability metrics, with a
further decrease on MT quality.

We also investigated what types of changes the
readability features could lead to. Table 2 shows a
sample of translations where the baseline is com-
pared to systems with readability features. There
are both cases where the readability features help

and cases where they are problematic. Overall,
these examples show that our simple features can
help achieve some interesting simplifications.

There is still much work to do on how to take
best advantage of the possibilities in Docent in or-
der to achieve readable texts. This attempt shows
the feasibility of the approach. We plan to ex-
tend this work for instance by better feature op-
timisation, by integrating part-of-speech tags into
our features in order to focus on terms rather than
common words, and by using simplified texts for
evaluation and tuning.

6 Conclusions

In this paper, we have presented Docent, an open-
source document-level decoder for phrase-based
SMT released under the GNU General Public Li-
cense. Docent is the first decoder that permits the
inclusion of feature models with unrestricted de-
pendencies between arbitrary parts of the output,
even crossing sentence boundaries. A number of
research groups have recently started to investig-
ate the interplay between SMT and discourse-level
phenomena such as pronominal anaphora, verb
tense selection and the generation of discourse
connectives. We expect that the availability of a
document-level decoder will make it substantially
easier to leverage discourse information in SMT
and make SMT models explore new ground bey-
ond the next sentence boundary.
