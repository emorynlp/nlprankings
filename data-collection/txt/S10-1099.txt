Abstract 

 

The task of extracting the opinion expressed in 

text is challenging due to different reasons. 

One of them is that the same word (in particu-

lar, adjectives) can have different polarities 

depending on the context. This paper presents 

the experiments carried out by the OpAL team 

for the participation in the SemEval 2010 Task 

18 – Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous 

Adjectives. Our approach is based on three dif-

ferent strategies: a) the evaluation of the polar-

ity of the whole context using an opinion min-

ing system; b) the assessment of the polarity of 

the local context, given by the combinations 

between the closest nouns and the adjective to 

be classified; c) rules aiming at refining the lo-

cal semantics through the spotting of modifi-

ers. The final decision for classification is tak-

en according to the output of the majority of 

these three approaches.  The method used 

yielded good results, the OpAL system run 

ranking fifth among 16 in micro accuracy and 

sixth in macro accuracy.

2 Introduction 

Recent years have marked the beginning and ex-

pansion of the Social Web, in which people free-

ly express and respond to opinion on a whole 

variety of topics. Moreover, at the time of taking 

a decision, more and more people search for in-

formation and opinions expressed on the Web on 

their matter of interest and base their final deci-

sion on the information found (Pang and Lee, 

2008). Nevertheless, the high quantity of data 

that has to be analysed imposed the development 

of specialized Natural Language Processing 

(NLP) systems that automatically extract, classi-

fy and summarize the opinions available on the 

web on different topics. Research in this field, of 

opinion mining (sentiment analysis), has ad-

dressed the problem of extracting and classifying 

opinions from different perspectives and at dif-

ferent levels, depending on various factors. 

While determining the overall opinion on a mov-

ie is sufficient for taking the decision to watch it 

or not, when buying a product, people are inter-

ested in the individual opinions on the different 

product characteristics.  Especially in this con-

text, opinion mining systems are confronted with 

a difficult problem: the fact that the adjectives 

used to express opinion have different polarities 

depending on the characteristic they are men-

tioned with. For example, “high price” is nega-

tive, while “high resolution” is positive. There-

fore, specialized methods have to be employed to 

correctly determine the contextual polarity of 

such words and thus accurately assign polarity to 

the opinion.    

This is the aim of the SemEval 2010 Task 18 – 

Disambiguation of Sentiment Ambiguous Adjec-

tives (Wu and Jin, 2010). In the following sec-

tions, we first present state-of-the art approaches 

towards polarity classification of opinions, sub-

sequently describing our approach in the SemEv-

al task. Finally, we present the results we ob-

tained in the evaluation and our plans for future 

work.

3 State of the Art  

Subjectivity analysis is defined by (Wiebe, 1994) 

as the “linguistic expression of somebody’s opi-

nions, sentiments, emotions, evaluations, beliefs 

and speculations”. Sentiment analysis, on the 

other hand, is defined as the task of extracting, 

from a text, the opinion expressed on an object 

(product, person, topic etc.) and classifying it as 

positive, negative or neutral. The task of senti-

ment analysis, considered a step further to sub-

jectivity analysis, is more complex than the lat-

ter, because it involves an extra step: the classifi-

cation of the retrieved opinion words according 

to their polarity. There are a series of techniques 

that were used to obtain lexicons of subjective 

words – e.g. the Opinion Finder lexicon (Wilson 

et al., 2005) and opinion words with associated 

polarity. (Hu and Liu, 2004) start with a set of 

seed adjectives (“good” and “bad”) and apply 

synonymy and antonymy relations in WordNet. 

A similar approach was used in building Word-

Net Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), 

starting from a larger set of seed affective words, 

classified according to the six basic categories of 

emotion (joy, sadness, fear, surprise, anger and 

disgust) and expanding the lexicon using paths in 

WordNet. Another related method was used in 

the creation of SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebas-

tiani, 2005), using a set of seed words whose po-

larity was known and expanded using gloss simi-

larity. The collection of appraisal terms in (Whi-

telaw et al., 2005), the terms also have polarity 

assigned. MicroWNOp (Cerini et al., 2007), 

another lexicon containing opinion words with 

their associated polarity, was built on the basis of 

a set of terms extracted from the General Inquirer 

lexicon and subsequently adding all the synsets 

in WordNet where these words appear. Other 

methods built sentiment lexicons using the local 

context of words. (Pang et al., 2002) built a lex-

icon of sentiment words with associated polarity 

value, starting with a set of classified seed adjec-

tives and using conjunctions (“and”) disjunctions 

(“or”, “but”) to deduce orientation of new words 

in a corpus. (Turney, 2002) classifies words ac-

cording to their polarity on the basis of the idea 

that terms with similar orientation tend to co-

occur in documents. Thus, the author computes 

the Pointwise Mutual Information score between 

seed words and new words on the basis of the 

number of AltaVista hits returned when querying 

the seed word and the word to be classified with 

the “NEAR” operator. In our work in (Balahur 

and Montoyo, 2008a), we compute the polarity 

of new words using “polarity anchors” (words 

whose polarity is known beforehand) and Nor-

malized Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 

2006) scores. Another approach that uses the po-

larity of the local context for computing word 

polarity is (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), who use 

a weighting function of the words around the 

context to be classified.   

4 The OpAL system at SemEval 2010 
Task 18 

In the SemEval 2010 Task 18, the participants 

were given a set of contexts in Chinese, in which  

14 dynamic sentiment ambiguous adjectives are 

selected. They are: 大|big, 小|small, 多|many, 少

|few, 高|high, 低|low, 厚|thick, 薄|thin, 深|deep, 

浅|shallow, 重|heavy, 轻 |light, 巨大|huge, 重大
|grave. The task was to automatically classify the 

polarity of these adjectives, i.e. to detect whether 

their sense in the context is positive or negative. 

The contexts were given in two forms: as plain 

text, in which the adjective to be classified was 

marked; in the second for, the text was tokenized 

and the tokens were tagged with part of speech 

(POS). There was no training set provided.  

  Our approach uses a set of opinion mining re-

sources and an opinion mining system that is 

implemented to work for English. This is why, 

the first step we took in our approach was to 

translate the given contexts into English using 

the Google Translator1. In order to perform this 

task, we first split the initial file into 10 smaller 

files, using a specialized program – GSplit32.  

The OpAL adjective polarity disambiguation 

system combines supervised methods with unsu-

pervised ones.  In order to judge the polarity of 

the adjectives, it uses three types of judgments. 

The first one is the general polarity of the con-

text, determined by our in-house opinion mining 

system - based on SVM machine learning on the 

NTCIR data and the EmotiBlog (Boldrini et al., 

2009) annotations and different subjectivity, opi-

nion and emotion lexica (Opinion Finder, Mi-

croWordNet Opinion, General Inquirer, Word-

Net Affect, emotion triggers (Balahur and Mon-

toyo, 2008b). The second one is the local polari-

ty, given by the highest number of results ob-

tained when issuing queries containing the clos-

est noun with the adjective to be disambiguated 

followed by the conjunction “AND” and a prede-

fined set of 6 adjectives whose polarity is non-

ambiguous – 3 positive - “positive”, “beautiful”, 

“good” and 3 negative – “negative”, “ugly”, 

“bad”. An example of such queries is “price high 

and good”. The third component is made up of 

rules, depending on the presence of specific 

modifiers in a window of 4 words before the ad-

jective.  The final verdict is given based on the 

vote given by the majority of the three compo-

nents, explained in detail in the next sections: 

4.1 The OpAL opinion mining component 

First, we process each context using Minipar
3
. 

We compute, for each word in a sentence, a se-

ries of features, computed from the NTCIR 7 

data and the EmotiBlog annotations. These 

words are used to compute vectors of features for 

each of the individual contexts: 

 the part of speech (POS)  

 opinionatedness/intensity - if the word is 
annotated as opinion word, its polarity, i.e. 1 

and -1 if the word is positive or negative, re-

spectively and 0 if it is not an opinion word, 

its intensity (1, 2 or 3) and 0 if it is not a 

subjective word 

 syntactic relatedness with other opinion 
word – if it is directly dependent of an opi-

nion word or modifier (0 or 1), plus the po-

larity/intensity and emotion of this word (0 

for all the components otherwise) 

  role in 2-word, 3-word, 4-word and sen-
tence annotations: opinionatedness, intensity 

and emotion of the other words contained in 

the annotation, direct dependency relations 

with them if they exist and 0 otherwise.  

We add to the opinion words annotated in 

EmotiBlog the list of opinion words found in the 

Opinion Finder, Opinion Finder, MicroWordNet 

Opinion, General Inquirer, WordNet Affect, 

emotion triggers lexical resources. We train the 

model using the SVM SMO implementation in 

Weka4. 

4.2 Assessing local polarity using Google 
queries 

This approach aimed at determining the polarity 

of the context immediately surrounding the ad-

jective to be classified. To that aim, we con-

structed queries using the noun found before the 

adjective in the context given, and issued six dif-

ferent queries on Google, together with six pre-

defined adjectives whose polarity is known (3

4
 http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ 

positive - “positive”, “beautiful”, “good” and 3 

negative – “negative”, “ugly”, “bad”). The form 

of the queries was “noun+adjective+AND+pre-

defined adjective”.  The local polarity was consi-

dered as the one for which the query issued the 

highest number of total results (total number of 

results for the 3 queries corresponding to the pos-

itive adjectives or to the negative adjectives, re-

spectively).  

4.3 Modifier rules for contextual polarity  

This rule accounts for the original, most fre-

quently used polarity of the given adjectives (e.g. 

high is positive, low is negative). For each of 

them, we define its default polarity. Subsequent-

ly, we determine whether in the window of 4 

words around the adjective there are any modifi-

ers (valence shifters). If this is the case, and they 

have an opposite value of polarity, the adjective 

is assigned a polarity value opposite from its de-

fault one (e.g. too high is negative).  We employ 

a list of 82 positive and 87 negative valence shif-

ters.

Since the gold standard was not provided, we 

were not able to perform an exhaustive analysis 

of the errors. However, from a random inspec-

tion of the system results, we could see that a 

large number of errors was due to the translation 

– through which modifiers are placed far from 

the word they determine or the words are not 

translated with their best equivalent.  

6 Conclusions and future work 

In this article we presented our approach towards 

the disambiguation of polarity ambiguous adjec-

tives depending on the context in which they ap-

pear. The OpAL system’s run was based on three 

subcomponents working in English – one assess-

ing the overall polarity of the context using an 

opinion mining system, the second assessing the 

local polarity using Google queries formed by 

expressions containing the noun present in the 

context before the adjective to be classified and 

the third one evaluating contextual polarity based 

on the adjective’s default value and the modifiers 

around it. The final output is based on the vote 

given by the majority of the three components. 

The approach had a good performance, the 

OpAL system run ranking fifth among 16 runs. 

Future work includes the separate evaluation of 

the three components and their combination in a 

unique approach, using machine learning, as well 

as a thorough assessment of errors that are due to 

translation.
