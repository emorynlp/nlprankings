Abstract

Within our ongoing effort to develop a com-
putational model to understand multi-modal
human dialogue in the field of elderly care,
this paper focuses on pronominal and deictic
co-reference resolution. After describing our
data collection effort, we discuss our anno-
tation scheme. We developed a co-reference
model that employs both a simple notion of
markable type, and multiple statistical mod-
els. Our results show that knowing the type
of the markable, and the presence of simulta-
neous pointing gestures improve co-reference
resolution for personal and deictic pronouns.

1 Introduction

Our ongoing research project, called RoboHelper,
focuses on developing an interface for older people
to effectively communicate with a robotic assistant
that can help them perform Activities of Daily Liv-
ing (ADLs) (Krapp, 2002), so that they can safely re-
main living in their home (Di Eugenio et al., 2010).
We are devising a multi-modal interface since peo-
ple communicate with one another using a variety of
verbal and non-verbal signals, including haptics, i.e.,
force exchange (as when one person hands a bowl to
another person, and lets go only when s/he senses
that the other is holding it). We have collected a
mid size multi-modal human-human dialogue cor-
pus, that we are currently processing and analyz-
ing. Meanwhile, we have started developing one
core component of our multi-modal interface, a co-
reference resolution system. In this paper, we will
present the component of the system that resolves

pronouns, both personal (I, you, it, they), and deictic
(this, that, these, those, here, there). Hence, this pa-
per presents our first steps toward a full co-reference
resolution module, and ultimately, the multi-modal
interface.

Co-reference resolution is likely the discourse
and dialogue processing task that has received the
most attention. However, as Eisenstein and Davis
(2006) notes, research on co-reference resolution
has mostly been applied to written text; this task
is more difficult in dialogue. First, utterances may
be informal, ungrammatical or disfluent; second,
people spontaneously use hand gestures, body ges-
tures and gaze. Pointing gestures are the eas-
iest gestures to identify, and vision researchers in
our project are working on recognizing pointing and
other hand gestures (Di Eugenio et al., 2010). In this
paper, we replicate the results from (Eisenstein and
Davis, 2006), that pointing gestures help improve
co-reference, in a very different domain. Other work
has shown that gestures can help detect sentence
boundaries (Chen and Harper, 2010) or user inten-
tions (Qu and Chai, 2008).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2 we describe the data collection and the on-
going annotation. In Section 3 we discuss our co-
reference resolution system, and we present experi-
ments and results in Section 4.

2 The ELDERLY-AT-HOME corpus

Due to the absence of multi-modal collaborative
human-human dialogue corpora that include haptic
data beyond what can be acquired via point-and-
touch interfaces, and in the population of interest,307



Figure 1: Experiment Excerpts

we undertook a new data collection effort. Our ex-
periments were conducted in a fully functional stu-
dio apartment at Rush University in Chicago – Fig-
ure 1 shows two screen-shots from our recorded ex-
periments. We equipped the room with 7 web cam-
eras to ensure multiple points of view. Each of the
two participants in the experiments wears a micro-
phone, and a data glove on their dominant hand to
collect haptics data. The ADLs we focused on in-
clude ambulating, getting up from a bed or a chair,
finding pots, opening cans and containers, putting
pots on a stove, setting the table etc. Two students
in gerontological nursing play the role of the helper
(HEL), both in pilot studies and with real subjects.
In 5 pilot dialogues, two faculty members played the
role of the elderly person (ELD). In the 15 real ex-
periments, ELD resides in an assisted living facil-
ity and was transported to the apartment mentioned
above. All elderly subjects are highly functioning at
a cognitive level and do not have any major physical
impairment.

The size of our collected video data is shown
in Table 1. The number of subjects refers to the
number of different ELD’s and does not include the
helpers; we do include our 5 pilot dialogues though,
since those pilot interactions do not measurably dif-
fer from those with the real subjects. Usually one
experiment lasts about 50’ (recording starts after in-
formed consent and after the microphones and data
gloves have been put on). Further, we eliminated
irrelevant content such as interruptions, e.g. by the
person who accompanied the elderly subjects, and
further explanations of the tasks. This resulted in
about 15 minutes of what we call effective data for

each subject; the effective data comprises 4782 turns
(see Table 1).

Subjects Raw(Mins) Effective(Mins) Turns
20 482 301 4782

Table 1: ELDERLY-AT-HOME Corpus Size

The effective portion of the data was transcribed
by the first two authors using the Anvil video anno-
tation tool (Kipp, 2001). A subset of the transcribed
data was annotated for co-reference, yielding 114
sub-dialogues corresponding to the tasks subjects
perform, such as finding bowls, filling a pot with wa-
ter, etc. (see Table 2).

An annotation excerpt is shown in Figure 2.
Markable tokens are classified into PLC(Place),
PERS(Person), OBJ(Object) types, and numbered
by type, e.g., PLC#5. Accordingly, we mark pro-
nouns with types as well, RPLC, RPERS, ROBJ, e.g.
RPLC#5. If a subject produced a pointing gesture,
we generate a markable token to mark what is being
pointed to at the end of the utterance (see Utt. 4 and 5
in Figure 2). Within the same task, if two markables
have the same type and the same markable index,
they are taken to co-refer (hence, longer chains of
reference across tasks are cut into shorter spans).

Haptics annotation is at the beginning. We have
identified grab, hold, give and receive as high-level
haptics phonemes that may be useful from the lan-
guage point of view. We have recently started anno-
tating our corpus with those labels.

Table 2: Annotated Corpus Size

In order to test the reliability of our annotation,
we double coded about 18% of the data, namely 21
sub-dialogues comprising 213 pronouns, on which
we computed the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996).
Similar to (Rodrıguez et al., 2010), we measured the
reliability of markable annotations, and of link to
the antecedent annotations. As concerns the mark-
able level, we obtained κ=0.945, which is high but
no surprisingly for such a simple task. At the link to
the antecedent level, we compared the links from
pronouns to antecedents in a specified context of 4
utterances, obtaining a reasonable κ=0.723.308

Figure 3: Co-reference System Architecture

The architecture of our co-reference resolution
system is shown in Figure 3.

We first pre-process a dialogue by splitting turns
into sentences, tokenizing sentences into tokens,
POS tagging tokens. The Markable model is used
to classify whether a token can be referred to and
what type of markable it is. The Markable model’s
feature set includes the POS tag of the token, the
word, the surrounding tokens’ POS tags in a win-
dow size of 3. The model outputs markable classes:
Place/Object/Person, or None, which means the to-
ken is not markable. A pointed-to entity serves as a
markable by default.

To perform resolution, each pronoun to be re-
solved ( I, you, it, they; this, that, these, those, here,
there) is paired with markables in the context of the
previous 2 utterances, the current utterance and the
utterance that follows, by using {pronoun, markable
type} compatibility rules. For example, let’s con-
sider the excerpt in Figure 2. To resolve one in
utterance 5, the system will generate 3 candidate
token pairs: <one(5,2), pasta(3,6)>, <one(5,2),
cabinet(4,-1)>, <one(5,2), cabinet(5,-1)> (includ-
ing the pointed-to markable is a way of roughly ap-
proximating information that will be returned by the
vision component). The elements in those pairs
are tokens with their coordinates in the format (Sen-
tenceIndex, TokenIndex); markables pointed to are
given negative token indices.

The Co-reference model will filter out the pairs
<pronoun, markable> that it judges to be incor-
rect. For the Co-reference model, we adopted a

subset of features which are commonly used in co-
reference resolution in written text. These features
apply to each <pronoun, markable> pair and in-
clude: Lexical features, i.e. words and POS tags for
both anaphora and antecedent; Syntactic features,
i.e. syntactic constraints such as number and per-
son agreement; Distance features, i.e. sentence dis-
tance, token distance and markable distance. Addi-
tionally, the Co-reference model uses pointing ges-
ture information. If the antecedent in the <pronoun,
markable> was pointed to, the pair is tagged as Is-
Pointed. In our data, people often use pronouns
and hand gestures instead of nouns when introduc-
ing new entities. It is not possible to map these
pronouns to a textual antecedent since none exists.
This confirms the findings from (Kehler, 2000): in
a multi-modal corpus, he found that no pronoun is
used without a gesture when it refers to a referent
which is not in focus.

4 Experiments and Discussion

The classification models described above were im-
plemented using the Weka package (Hall et al.,
2009). Specifically, for each model, we experi-
mented with J48 (a decision tree implementation)
and LibSVM (a Support Vector Machine implemen-
tation). All the results reported below are calculated
using 10 fold cross-validation.

We evaluated the performances of individual
models separately (Tables 3 and 4), and of the sys-
tem as a whole (Table 5).

Algorithm Precision Recall F-Measure
J48 0.984 0.984 0.984
LibSVM 0.979 0.936 0.954
Baseline 0.971 0.971 0.971

Table 3: Markable Model Performance

The results in Table 3 are not surprising, since de-
tecting the type of markables is a simple task. In-
deed the results of the baseline model are extremely309

Table 5: Co-reference System Performance (Markable + Co-reference Models)

high as well. We compute the baseline by assigning
to the potential markable (i.e., each word) its most
frequent class in the training set (recall that the four
classes include None as well).

For the Co-reference model, we conducted 2 sets
of experiments to ascertain the effect of including
Gesture in the model. As shown in Table 4, both J48
and LibSVM obtain better results when we include
gestures in the model. χ2 shows that differences in
precision and recall 1 are significant at the p ≤ 0.01
level, though the absolute improvement is not high.

As concerns the evaluation of the whole system,
we ran a 4-way experiment, where we examine the
performance of the system on all pronouns, and on
those pronouns left after eliminating first and second
person pronouns, without and with Gesture informa-
tion. We also ran two sets of baseline experiments.
In the baseline experiments, we link each pronoun
we want to resolve, to the most recent utterance-
markable token and to a pointed-to markable token
(if applicable). Markables are filtered by the same
compatibility rules mentioned above.

Regarding the metrics we used for evaluation, we
used the same method as Strube and Müller (2003),
which is also similar to MUC standard (Hirschman,

1997). As the golden set, we used the human an-
notated links from the pronouns to markables in the
same context of four utterances used by the system.
Then, we compared the co-reference links found by
the system against the golden set, and we finally cal-
culated precision, recall and F-Measure.

Table 5 shows that the F-measure is higher when
including gestures, no matter the type of pronouns.
When we include gestures, there is no difference be-
tween “All Pronouns” and “3rd Person + Deictic”.
In the “3rd Person + Deictic” experiments, we ob-
served huge drops in recall, from 0.902 to 0.028 for
J48, and from 0.695 to 0.009 for LibSVM algorithm.
This confirms the point we made earlier, that 3rd
person pronouns/deictic words (Kehler, 2000) often
do not have textual antecedents, since when accom-
panied by simultaneous pointing they introduce new
entities in a dialogue.

Comparison to previous work is feasible only at a
high level, because of the usage of different corpora
and/or measurement metrics. This said, our model
with gestures outperforms Strube and Müller (2003),
who did not use gesture information to resolve pro-
nouns in spoken dialogue. Strube and Müller (2003)
used the 20 Switchboard dialogues as their experi-
ment dataset, and used the MUC metrics. Our re-310



sults are similar to Eisenstein and Davis (2006), but
there are two main differences. First, the corpus
they used is smaller than what we used in this pa-
per. Their corpus was collected by themselves and
consisted of 16 videos, each video was 2-3 minutes
in length. Second, they used a difference measure-
ment metrics called CEAF (Luo, 2005).

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented the new ELDERLY-AT-
HOME multi-modal corpus we collected. A co-
reference resolution system for personal and deic-
tic pronouns has been developed on the basis of the
annotated corpus. Our results confirm that gestures
improve co-reference resolution; a simple notion of
type also helps. The Markable and Co-reference
modules we presented are a first start in developing
a full multi-modal co-reference resolution module.
Apart from completing the annotation of our cor-
pus, we will develop an annotation scheme for hap-
tics, and investigate how haptics information affects
co-reference and other dialogue phenomena. Ulti-
mately, both pointing gestures and haptic informa-
tion will automatically be recognized by the collab-
orators in the project we are members of.
