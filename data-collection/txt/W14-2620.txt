Abstract

There are numerous studies suggesting
that published news stories have an im-
portant effect on the direction of the stock
market, its volatility, the volume of trades,
and the value of individual stocks men-
tioned in the news. There is even some
published research suggesting that auto-
mated sentiment analysis of news doc-
uments, quarterly reports, blogs and/or
Twitter data can be productively used as
part of a trading strategy. This paper
presents just such a family of trading
strategies, and then uses this application to
re-examine some of the tacit assumptions
behind how sentiment analyzers are gen-
erally evaluated, in spite of the contexts of
their application. This discrepancy comes
at a cost.

1 Introduction

Amidst the vast amount of user-generated and
professionally-produced textual data, analysts
from different fields are turning to the natural lan-
guage processing community to sift through these
large corpora and make sense of them. Interna-
tional collaborative projects such as the Digging
into Data Challenge (2012) or the Big Data Con-
ference sponsored by the Marketing Science In-
stitute (2012) are some recent examples of these
initiatives.

The proliferation of opinion-rich text on the
World Wide Web, which includes anything from
product reviews to political blog posts, led to the
growth of sentiment analysis as a research field
more than a decade ago. The market need to quan-
tify opinions expressed in social media and the
blogosphere has provided a great opportunity for
sentiment analysis technology to make an impact
in many sectors, including the financial industry,

in which interest in automatically detecting news
sentiment in order to inform trading strategies ex-
tends back at least 10 years. In this case, senti-
ment takes on a slightly different meaning; posi-
tive sentiment is not the emotional and subjective
use of laudatory language. Rather, a news article
that contains positive sentiment is optimistic about
the future financial prospects of a company.

Zhang and Skiena (2010) have shown that news
sentiment can effectively inform simple market
neutral trading algorithms, producing a maximum
yearly return of around 30%, and even more when
using sentiment from blogs and Twitter data. They
did so, however, without an appropriate baseline,
making it very difficult to appreciate the signif-
icance of this number. Using a very standard
sentiment analyzer, we are able to garner annual-
ized returns over twice that percentage (70.1%),
and in a manner that highlights some of the bet-
ter design decisions that Zhang and Skiena (2010)
made, viz., their decision to use raw SVM scores
rather than discrete positive or negative senti-
ment classes, and their decision to go long (resp.,
short) in the n best- (worst-) ranking securities
rather than to treat all positive (negative) securi-
ties equally. We trade based upon the raw SVM
score itself, rather than its relative rank within a
basket of other securities, and tune a threshold for
that score that determines whether to go long, neu-
tral or short. We sample our stocks for both train-
ing and evaluation with and without survivor bias,
the tendency for long positions in stocks that are
publicly traded as of the date of the experiment to
pay better using historical trading data than long
positions in random stocks sampled on the trad-
ing days themselves. Most of the evaluations of
sentiment-based trading either unwittingly adopt
this bias, or do not need to address it because their
returns are computed over historical periods so
brief. We also provide appropriate trading base-
lines as well as Sharpe ratios to attempt to quan-

119



tify the relative risk inherent to our experimen-
tal strategies. As tacitly assumed by most of the
work on this subject, our trading strategy is not
portfolio-limited, and our returns are calculated on
a percentage basis with theoretical, commission-
free trades.

Our motivation for undertaking this study has
been to reappraise the evaluation standards for
sentiment analyzers. It is not at all uncommon
within the sentiment analysis community to eval-
uate a sentiment analyzer with a variety of classi-
fication accuracy or hypothesis testing scores such
as F-measures, kappas or Krippendorff alphas de-
rived from human-subject annotations, even when
more extensional measures are available. In secu-
rities trading, this would of course include actual
market returns from historical data. With Holly-
wood films, another popular domain for automatic
sentiment analysis, one might refer to box-office
returns or the number of award nominations that
a film receives rather than to its star-rankings on
review websites where pile-on and confirmation
biases are widely known to be rampant. Are the
opinions of human judges, paid or unpaid, a suf-
ficient proxy for the business cases that actually
drive the demand for sentiment analyzers?

We regret to report that they are not. We have
even found a particular modification to our stan-
dard financial sentiment analyzer that, when eval-
uated against an evaluation test set sampled from
the same pool of human-subject annotations as
the analyzer’s training data, returns significantly
poorer performance, but when evaluated against
actual market returns, yields significantly better
performance. This should worry researchers who
rely on classification accuracies and hypothesis
tests relative to human-subject data, because the
improvements that they report, whether based on
better feature selection or different pattern recog-
nition algorithms, may in fact not be improve-
ments at all.

The good news, however, is that, based upon our
experience within this particular domain, training
on human-subject annotations and then tuning on
more extensional data, in cases where the latter
are less abundant, seems to suffice for bringing
the evaluation back to reality. A likely machine-
learning explanation for this is that whenever two
unbiased estimators are pitted against each other,
they often result in an improved combined perfor-
mance because each acts as a regularizer against

the other. If true, this merely attests to the relative
independence of task-based and human-annotated
knowledge sources. A more HCI-oriented view
would argue that direct human-subject annotations
are highly problematic unless the annotations have
been elicited in manner that is ecologically valid.
When human subjects are paid to annotate quar-
terly reports or business news, they are paid re-
gardless of the quality of their annotations, the
quality of their training, or even their degree of
comprehension of what they are supposed to be
doing. When human subjects post film reviews on
web-sites, they are participating in a cultural activ-
ity in which the quality of the film under consider-
ation is only one factor. These sources of annota-
tion have not been properly controlled.

2 Related Work in Financial Sentiment
Analysis

Studies confirming the relationship between me-
dia and market performance date back to at
least Niederhoffer (1971), who looked at NY
Times headlines and determined that large market
changes were more likely following world events
than on random days. Conversely, Tetlock (2007)
looked at media pessimism and concluded that
high media pessimism predicts downward prices.
Tetlock (2007) also developed a trading strategy,
achieving modest annualized returns of 7.3%. En-
gle and Ng (1993) looked at the effects of news on
volatility, showing that bad news introduces more
volatility than good news. Chan (2003) claimed
that prices are slow to reflect bad news and stocks
with news exhibit momentum. Antweiler and
Frank (2004) showed that there is a significant, but
negative correlation between the number of mes-
sages on financial discussion boards about a stock
and its returns, but that this trend is economically
insignificant. Aside from Tetlock (2007), none of
this work evaluated the effectiveness of an actual
sentiment-based trading strategy.

There is, of course, a great deal of work on
automated sentiment analysis as well; see Pang
and Lee (2008) for a survey. More recent de-
velopments that are germane to our work include
the use of different information retrieval weighting
schemes (Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010) and the
utilization of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
in a joint sentiment/topic framework (Lin and He,
2009).

There has also been some work that analyzes the

120



sentiment of financial documents without actually
using those results in trading strategies (Koppel
and Shtrimberg, 2004; Ahmad et al., 2006; Fu et
al., 2008; O’Hare et al., 2009; Devitt and Ahmad,
2007; Drury and Almeida, 2011). As to the rela-
tionship between sentiment and stock price, Das
and Chen (2007) performed sentiment analysis on
discussion board posts. Using this analysis, they
built a “sentiment index” that computed the time-
varying sentiment of the 24 stocks in the Morgan
Stanley High-Tech Index (MSH), and tracked how
well their index followed the aggregate price of the
MSH itself. Their sentiment analyzer was based
upon a voting algorithm, although they also dis-
cussed a vector distance algorithm that performed
better. Their baseline, the Rainbow algorithm, also
came within 1 percentage point of their reported
accuracy. This is one of the very few studies that
has evaluated sentiment analysis itself (as opposed
to a sentiment-based trading strategy) against mar-
ket returns (versus gold-standard sentiment anno-
tations). Das and Chen (2007) focused exclusively
on discussion board messages and their evaluation
was limited to the stocks on the MSH, whereas
we focus on Reuters newswire and evaluate over
a wide range of NYSE-listed stocks and market
capitalization levels.

Butler and Keselj (2009) try to determine sen-
timent from corporate annual reports using both
character n-gram profiles and readability scores.
They also developed a sentiment-based trading
strategy with high returns, but do not report how
the strategy works or how they computed the re-
turns, making the results difficult to compare to
ours. Basing a trading strategy upon annual re-
ports also calls into question the frequency with
which the trading strategy could be exercised.

The work that is most similar to ours is that
of Zhang and Skiena (2010). They look at both
financial blog posts and financial news, forming
a market-neutral trading strategy whereby each
day, companies are ranked by their reported sen-
timent. The strategy then goes long and short on
equal numbers of positive- and negative-sentiment
stocks, respectively. They conduct their trading
evaluation over the period from 2005 to 2009, and
report a yearly return of roughly 30% when us-
ing news data, and yearly returns of up to 80%
when they use Twitter and blog data. Further-
more, they trade based upon sentiment ranking
rather than pure sentiment analysis, i.e., instead of

trading based on the raw sentiment score of the
document, they first rank the documents and trade
based on this relative ranking.

Zhang and Skiena (2010) compare their strat-
egy to two strategies which they term Worst-
sentiment Strategy and Random-selection Strat-
egy. The Worst-sentiment Strategy trades the op-
posite of their strategy, going short on positive sen-
timent stocks and going long on negative senti-
ment stocks. The Random-selection Strategy ran-
domly picks stocks to go long and short in. As
trading strategies, these baselines set a very low
standard. Our evaluation compares our strategy to
standard trading benchmarks such as momentum
trading and holding the S&P, as well as to oracle
trading strategies over the same trading days.

3 Method and Materials

3.1 News Data

Our dataset consists of a combination of two col-
lections of Reuters news documents. The first was
obtained for a roughly evenly weighted collec-
tion of 22 small-, mid- and large-cap companies,
randomly sampled from the list of all companies
traded on the NYSE as of 10th March, 1997. The
second was obtained for a collection of 20 com-
panies randomly sampled from those companies
that were publicly traded in March, 1997 and still
listed on 10th March, 2013. For both collections
of companies, we collected every chronologically
third Reuters news document about them from the
period March, 1997 to March, 2013. The news
articles prior to 10th March, 2005 were used as
training data, and the news articles on or after 10th

March, 2005 were reserved as testing data. We
chose to split the dataset at a fixed date rather than
randomly in order not to incorporate future news
into the classifier through lexical choice.

In total, there were 1256 financial news docu-
ments. Each was labelled by two human annota-
tors as being one of negative, positive, or neutral
sentiment. The annotators were instructed to de-
termine the state of the author’s belief about the
company, rather than to make a personal assess-
ment of the company’s prospects. Of the 1256,
only the 991 documents that were labelled twice
as negative or positive were used for training and
evaluation.

3.2 Sentiment Analysis and Intrinsic
Evaluation

For each selected document, we first filter out all
punctuation characters and the most common 429
stop words. Our sentiment analyzer is a support-
vector machine with a linear kernel function im-
plemented using SVMlight (Joachims, 1999). We
have experimented with raw term frequencies, bi-
nary term-presence features, and term frequen-
cies weighted by the BM25 scheme, which had
the most resilience in the study of information-
retrieval weighting schemes for sentiment analysis
by Paltoglou and Thelwall (2010). We performed
10 fold cross-validation on the training data, con-
structing our folds so that each contains an approx-
imately equal number of negative and positive ex-
amples. This ensures that we do not accidentally
bias a fold.

Pang et al. (2002) use word presence features
with no stop list, instead excluding all words with
frequencies of 3 or less. Pang et al. (2002) nor-
malize their word presence feature vectors, rather
than term weighting with an IR-based scheme like
BM25, which also involves a normalization step.
Pang et al. (2002) also use an SVM with a linear
kernel on their features, but they train and com-
pute sentiment values on film reviews rather than
financial texts, and their human judges also clas-
sified the training films on a scale from 1 to 5,
whereas ours used a scale that can be viewed as
being from -1 to 1, with specific qualitative inter-
pretations assigned to each number. Antweiler and
Frank (2004) use SVMs with a polynomial kernel
(of unstated degree) to train on word frequencies
relative to a three-valued classification, but they
only count frequencies for the 1000 words with
the highest mutual information scores relative to
the classification labels. Butler and Keselj (2009)
also use an SVM trained upon a very different set

of features, and with a polynomial kernel of degree
3.

As a sanity check, we measured the accuracy of
our sentiment analyzer on film reviews by training
and evaluating on Pang and Lee’s (Pang and Lee,
2004) film reviews dataset, which contains 1000
positively and 1000 negatively labelled reviews.
Pang and Lee conveniently labelled the folds that
they used when they ran their experiments. Using
these same folds, we obtain an average accuracy
of 86.85%, which is comparable to Pang and Lee’s
86.4% score for subjectivity extraction.

Table 1 shows the performance of SVM with
BM25 weighting on our Reuters evaluation set
versus several baselines. All baselines are iden-
tical except for the term weighting schemes used,
and whether stop words were removed. As can be
observed, SVM-BM25 has the highest sentiment
classification accuracy: 80.164% on average over
the 10 folds. This compares favourably with pre-
vious reports of 70.3% average accuracy over 10
folds on financial news documents (Koppel and
Shtrimberg, 2004). We will nevertheless adhere
to normalized term presence for now, in order to
stay close to Pang and Lee’s (Pang and Lee, 2004)
implementation.

4 Task-based Evaluation

In our second evaluation protocol, we evaluate the
accuracy of the sentiment analyzer by embedding
the analyzer inside a simple trading strategy, and
then trading with it.

Our trading strategy is simple: going long when
the classifier reports positive sentiment in a news
article about a company, and short when the classi-
fier reports negative sentiment. In section 4.1, we
use the discrete polarity returned by the classifier
to decide whether go long/abstain/short a stock. In
section 4.2 we instead use the raw SVM score that
reports the distance of the current document from
the classifier’s decision boundary.

In section 4.3, we hold the trading strategy con-
stant, and instead vary the document representa-
tion features in the underlying sentiment analyzer.
Here, we measure both market return and classifier
accuracy to determine whether they agree.

In all three experiments, we compare the per-
position returns of trading strategies with the fol-
lowing four standards, where the number of days
for which a position is held remains constant:

1. The momentum strategy computes the price

122



of the stock h days ago, where h is the hold-
ing period. Then, it goes long for h days if
the previous price is lower than the current
price. It goes short otherwise.

2. The S&P strategy simply goes long on the
S&P 500 for the holding period. This strat-
egy completely ignores the stock in question
and the news about it.

3. The oracle S&P strategy computes the value
of the S&P 500 index h days into the future.
If the future value is greater than the current
day’s value, then it goes long on the S&P 500
index. Otherwise, it goes short.

4. The oracle strategy computes the value of the
stock h days into the future. If the future
value is greater than the current day’s value,
then it goes long on the stock. Otherwise, it
goes short.

The oracle and oracle S&P strategies are included
as toplines to determine how close the experimen-
tal strategies come to ones with perfect knowledge
of the future. “Market-trained” is the same as “ex-
perimental” at test time, but trains the sentiment
analyzer on the market return of the stock in ques-
tion for h days following a training article’s publi-
cation, rather than the article’s annotation.

4.1 Experiment One: Utilizing Sentiment
Labels in the Trading Strategy

Given a news document for a publicly traded com-
pany, the trading agent first computes the senti-
ment class of the document. If the sentiment is
positive, the agent goes long on the stock on the
date the news is released. If the sentiment is neg-
ative, it goes short. All trades are made based on
the adjusted closing price on this date. We evalu-
ate the performance of this strategy using four dif-
ferent holding periods: 30, 5, 3, and 1 day(s).

The returns and Sharpe ratios are presented in
Table 2 for the four different holding periods and
the five different trading strategies. The Sharpe
ratio can be viewed as a return to risk ratio. A
high Sharpe ratio indicates good return for rela-
tively low risk. The Sharpe ratio is calculated as
follows:

S =
E[Ra −Rb]√
var(Ra −Rb)

,

where Ra is the return of a single asset and Rb is
the return of a risk-free asset, such as a 10-year
U.S. Treasury note.

Table 2: Returns and Sharpe ratios for the Experi-
mental, baseline and topline trading strategies over
30, 5, 3, and 1 day(s) holding periods.

The returns from this experimental trading sys-
tem are fairly low, although they do beat the base-
lines. A one-way ANOVA test between the ex-
perimental strategy, momentum strategy, and S&P
strategy using the percent returns from the indi-
vidual trades yields p values of 0.06493, 0.08162,
0.1792, and 0.4164, respectively, thus failing to
reject the null hypothesis that the returns are not
significantly higher. Furthermore, the means and
medians of all three trading strategies are approx-
imately the same and centred around 0. The stan-
dard deviations of the experimental strategy and
the momentum strategy are nearly identical, dif-
fering only in the thousandths digit. The standard
deviations for the S&P strategy differ from the
other two strategies due to the fact that the strat-
egy buys and sells the entire S&P 500 index and
not the individual stocks described in the news ar-
ticles. There is, in fact, no convincing evidence
that discrete sentiment class leads to an improved
trading strategy from this or any other study with

which we are familiar, based on the details that
they publish. One may note, however, that the re-
turns from the experimental strategy have slightly
higher Sharpe ratios than either of the baselines.

One may also note that using a sentiment ana-
lyzer mostly beats training directly on market data,
which to an extent vindicates the use of sentiment
annotation as a separate component.

Figure 1 shows the market capitalizations of
the companies for each individual trade plotted
against the percent return for the 1 day holding pe-
riod. The correlation between the two variables is
not significant. The graphs for the other holding
periods are similar.

Figure 2 shows the percent change in share
value plotted against the raw SVM score for the
different holding periods. We can see a weak cor-
relation between the two. For the 30 days, 5 days,
3 days, and 1 day holding periods, the correlations
are 0.017, 0.16, 0.16, and 0.16, respectively. The
line of best fit is shown.

This prompts us to conduct our next experiment.

4.2 Experiment Two: Utilizing SVM scores
in Trading Strategy

4.2.1 Variable Single Threshold
Previously, we would label a document as positive
(negative) if the score is above (below) 0, because
0 is the decision boundary. However, 0 might not
be the best threshold for providing high returns.
To examine this hypothesis, we took the evaluation
dataset, i.e. the dataset with news articles dated on
or after March 10, 2005, and divided it into two
folds where each fold has an equal number of doc-

uments with positive and negative sentiment. We
used the first fold to determine an optimal thresh-
old value θ and trade using the data from the sec-
ond fold and that threshold. For every news article,
if the SVM score for that article is above (below)
θ, then we go long (short) on the appropriate stock
on the day the article was released. A separate
theta was determined for each holding period. We
varied θ from −1 to 1 in increments of 0.1.

Using this method, we were able to obtain much
higher returns. In order of 30, 5, 3, and 1 day hold-
ing periods, the returns were 0.057%, 1.107%,
1.238%, and 0.745%. This is a large improvement
over the previous returns, as they are average per-
position figures.1

4.2.2 Safety Zones
For every news item classified, SVM outputs a
score. For a binary SVM with a linear kernel func-
tion f , given some feature vector x, f(x) can be
viewed as the signed distance of x from the de-
cision boundary (Boser et al., 1992). It is then
possibly justified to interpret raw SVM scores as
degrees to which an article is positive or negative.

As in the previous section, we separate the eval-
uation set into the same two folds, only now we
use two thresholds, θ > ζ. We will go long when
the SVM score is above θ, abstain when the SVM
score is between θ and ζ, and go short when the
SVM score is below ζ. This is a strict generaliza-
tion of the above experiment, in which ζ = θ.

For convenience, we will assume in this section
that ζ = −θ, leaving us again with one parameter
to estimate. We again vary θ from 0 to 1 in in-
crements of 0.1. Figure 3 shows the returns as a
function of θ for each holding period on the devel-
opment dataset. If we increased the upper bound
on θ to be greater than 1, then there would be too
few trading examples (less than 10) to reliably cal-
culate the Sharpe ratio. Using this method with
θ = 1, we were able to obtain even higher returns:
3.843%, 1.851%, 1.691, and 2.251% for the 30,
5, 3, and 1 day holding periods, versus 0.057%,
1.107%, 1.238%, and 0.745% in the second task-
based experiment.

4.3 Experiment Three: Feature Selection
Let us now hold the trading strategy fixed (at the
final one, with safety zones) and turn to the un-
derlying sentiment analyzer. With a good trading

1Training directly on market data, by comparison, yields
-0.258%, -0.282%, -0.036% and -0.388%, respectively.

strategy in place, it is clearly possible to vary some
aspect of the sentiment analyzer in order to deter-
mine its best setting in this context. Is classifier ac-
curacy a suitable proxy for this? Indeed, we may
hope that classifier accuracy will be more portable
to other possible tasks, but then it must at least
correlate well with task-based performance.

We tried another feature representation for doc-
uments. In addition to evaluating those attempted
earlier, we now hypothesize that the passive voice
may be useful to emphasize in our representations,
as the existential passive can be used to evade re-
sponsibility. So we add to the BM25 weighted
vector the counts of word tokens ending in “n” or
“d” as well as the total count of every conjugated
form of the copular verb: “be”, “is”, “am”, “are”,
“were”, “was”, and “been”. These three features
are superficial indicators of the passive voice.

Table 3 presents the returns obtained from
these 6 feature representations. The feature set
with BM25-weighted term frequencies plus the
number of copulars and tokens ending in “n”,
“d” (bm25 freq d n copular) yields higher returns
than any other representation attempted on the 5,
3, and 1 day holding periods, and the second-
highest on the 30 days holding period, But it has
the worst classification accuracy by far: a full 18
percentage points below term presence. This is a
very compelling illustration of how misleading an
intrinsic evaluation can be. Other agreement mea-
sures likewise point in the opposite direction.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we examined the application of senti-
ment analysis in stock trading strategies. We built
a binary sentiment classifier that achieves high ac-
curacy when tested on movie data and financial
news data from Reuters. In three task-based ex-
periments, we evaluated the usefulness of senti-
ment analysis in simple trading strategies. Al-

though high annual returns can be achieved by
simply utilizing sentiment labels in a trading strat-
egy, they can be improved by incorporating the
output of the SVM’s decision function. We have
observed that classification accuracy alone is not
always an accurate predictor of task-based perfor-
mance. This calls into question the benefit of using
intrinsic sentiment classification accuracy, partic-
ularly when the relative cost of a task-based eval-
uation may be comparably low. We have also de-
termined that training on human-annotated senti-
ment does in fact perform better than training on
market returns themselves. So sentiment analysis
is an important component, but it must be tuned
against task data.

As for future work, we plan to explore other
ways of deriving sentiment labels for supervised
training. It would be interesting to infer the senti-
ment of published news from stock price fluctua-
tions instead of the reverse. Given that many fac-
tors that affect stock price fluctuations and further
considering the drift that is present in stock prices
as a result of bad published news (Chan, 2003),
this mode of inference is not simple and requires
careful consideration and design.

Furthermore, we would like to study how senti-
ment is defined in the financial world. In particu-
lar, we want to examine the relationship between
the precise definition of news sentiment and trad-
ing strategy returns. This study has used a rather
general definition of news sentiment. We are in-
terested in exploring if there is a more precise def-
inition that can improve trading performance.

Our current price data only includes adjusted
opening and closing prices. Most of our news data
contain only the date of the article, not the specific
time. It is possible that a much shorter-term trad-
ing strategy than we can currently test would be
even more successful.
