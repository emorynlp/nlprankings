Abstract

For languages with complex morpholo-
gies, limited resources and tools, and/or
lack of standard grammars, developing an-
notated resources can be a challenging
task. Annotated resources developed un-
der time/money constraints for such lan-
guages tend to tradeoff depth of represen-
tation with degree of noise. We present
two methods for automatic correction and
extension of morphological annotations,
and demonstrate their success on three di-
vergent Egyptian Arabic corpora.

1 Introduction

Annotated corpora are essential for most research
in natural language processing (NLP). For exam-
ple, the development of treebanks, such as the
Penn Treebank and the Penn Arabic Treebank,
has been essential in pushing research on part-
of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing of English
and Arabic (Marcus et al., 1993; Maamouri et al.,
2004). The creation of such resources tends to be
quite expensive and time consuming: guidelines
need to be developed, annotators hired, trained,
and regularly evaluated for quality control. For
languages with complex morphologies, limited re-
sources and tools, and/or lack of standard gram-
mars, such as any of the Dialectal Arabic (DA)
varieties, developing annotated resources can be a
challenging task. As a result, annotated resources
developed under time/money constraints for such
languages tend to tradeoff depth of representation
with degree of noise. In the extremes, we find rich
morphological representations that may be noisy
and inconsistent or simple by highly consistent
and reliable annotations that have limited usabil-
ity. Furthermore, such resources are often devel-
oped by different research groups leading to many

inconstancies that make pooling these resources
not a very easy task.

In this paper, we describe two general tech-
niques to address the limitations of the two types
of annotations: corrections of rich noisy annota-
tions and extensions of clean but shallow ones.
We present our work on Egyptian Arabic, an im-
portant Arabic dialect with limited resources, and
rich and ambiguous morphology. Resulting from
this effort is the largest Egyptian Arabic corpus
annotated in one common representation by pool-
ing resources from three very different sources:
a non-final, pre-release version of the ARZ1 cor-
pora from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)
(Maamouri et al., 2012g), the LDC’s CallHome
Egypt transcripts (Gadalla et al., 1997) and CMU’s
Egyptian Arabic corpus (CMUEAC) (Mohamed et
al., 2012).

Although the paper focuses on Arabic, the ba-
sic problem is relevant to other languages, espe-
cially spontaneously written colloquial language
forms such as those used in social media. The
general solutions we propose are language inde-
pendent given availability of specific language re-
sources.

Next we discuss some related work and rel-
evant linguistic facts (Sections 2 and 3, respec-
tively). Section 4 presents our annotation cor-
rection technique; and Section 5 presents out an-
notation extension technique. Finally, Section 6
presents some statistics on the Egyptian Arabic
corpus annotated in one unified representation re-
sulting from our correction and extension work.

2 Related Work

Much work has been done on automatic spelling
correction. Both supervised and unsupervised ap-
proaches have been used employing a variety of
tools, resources, and heuristics, e.g., morpholog-
ical analyzers, language models, annotated data
and edit-distance measures, respectively (Kukich,
1992; Oflazer, 1996; Shaalan et al., 2003; Hassan
et al., 2008; Kolak and Resnik, 2002; Magdy and
Darwish, 2006). Our work is different from these
approaches in that it extends beyond spelling of
word forms to deeper annotations. However, we
use some of these techniques to correct not just
the words, but also malformed POS tags.

A number of efforts exist on treebank en-
richment for many languages including Arabic
(Palmer et al., 2008; Hovy et al., 2006; Alkuh-
lani and Habash, 2011; Alkuhlani et al., 2013).
Our morphological extension effort is similar to
Alkuhlani et al. (2013)’s work except that they
start with tokenizations, reduced POS tags and de-
pendency trees and extend them to full morpho-
logical information.

There has been a lot of work on Arabic POS tag-
ging and morphological disambiguation (Habash
and Rambow, 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Hajič et
al., 2005; Habash, 2010; Habash et al., 2013).
The work by Habash et al. (2013) uses one of the
resources we improve on in this paper. In their
work, they simply attempt to “synchronize” un-
known/malformed annotations with the morpho-
logical analyzer they use, thus forcing a reading on
the word to make the unknown/malformed annota-
tion usable. In our work, we address the cleaning
issue directly. We intend to make these automatic
corrections and extensions available in the future
so that they can be used in future disambiguation
tools.

Maamouri et al. (2009) described a set of man-
ual and automatic techniques used to improve on
the quality of the Penn Arabic Treebank. Their
work is most similar to ours except in the follow-
ing aspects: we work only on morphology and for
dialectal Arabic, whereas their work is primarily
on syntax and standard Arabic. Furthermore, the
challenge of malformed tags is not a major prob-
lem for them, while it is a core problem for us.
Furthermore, we work with data that has partial
annotations that we extend, while their work was
for very rich syntax/morphology annotations.

3 Linguistic Facts

The Arabic language is a collection of variants,
most prominent amongst which is Modern Stan-
dard Arabic (MSA), the official language of the
media and education. The other variants, the Ara-
bic dialects, are the day-to-day native vernaculars
spoken in the Arab World. While MSA is the of-
ficial language, it is not the native language of any
modern day Arabic speakers. Their differences
from MSA are comparable to the differences be-
tween Romance languages and Latin.2

Egyptian Arabic poses many challenges for
NLP. Arabic in general is a morphologically com-
plex language which includes rich inflectional
morphology, expressed both templatically and af-
fixationally, and several classes of attachable cl-
itics. For example, the Egyptian Arabic word
AëñJ.

�
JºJ
ëð wi+ha+yi-ktib-uw+hA

3 ‘and they will
write it’ has two proclitics (+ð wi+ ‘and’ and + è
ha+ ‘will’), one prefix -ø



yi- ‘3rd person’, one

suffix ð- -uw ‘masculine plural’ and one pronom-
inal enclitic Aë+ +hA ‘it/her’. The word is consid-
ered an inflected form of the lemma katab ‘write
[lit. he wrote]’. An important challenge for NLP
work on dialectal Arabic in general is the lack of
an orthographic standard. Egyptian Arabic writ-
ers are often inconsistent even in their own writ-
ing (Habash et al., 2012a), e.g., the future particle
h Ha appears as a separate word or as a proclitic

+h/+ë Ha+/ha+, reflecting different pronuncia-
tions. Arabic orthography in general drops dia-
critical marks that mark short vowels and gemi-
nation. However in analyses, we want these dia-
critics to be indicated. Moreover, some letters in
Arabic (in general) are often spelled inconsistently
which leads to an increase in both sparsity (multi-
ple forms of the same word) and ambiguity (same
form corresponding to multiple words), e.g., vari-
ants of Hamzated Alif,


@ Â or @


Ǎ, are often writ-

ten without their Hamza (Z ’): @ A; and the Alif-
Maqsura (or dotless Ya) ø ý and the regular dotted
Ya ø



y are often used interchangeably in word fi-

nal position (El Kholy and Habash, 2010). For the

2Habash and Rambow (2006) reported that a state-of-the-
art MSA morphological analyzer has only 60% coverage of
Levantine Arabic verb forms.

3Arabic orthographic transliteration is presented in the
Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter scheme (Habash et al., 2007):

purposes of normalizing the representations used
in computational models, we follow the work of
Habash et al. (2012a) who devised a conventional
orthography for dialectal Arabic (CODA) for use
in computational processing of Arabic dialects..

An analysis of an Egyptian word for our work
consists of a surface form that may not be in
CODA (henceforth, RAW), a fully diacritized
CODA form (henceforth, DIAC), a morpheme
split form (henceforth, MORPH), which may
slightly differ from the allomorphic DIAC surface
forms, a POS tag for each morpheme and stem,
and a lemma (henceforth LEM). For instance,
the Egyptian Arabic example used above has the
following analysis:

RAW whyktbuwhA
DIAC wiHayiktibuwhA
MORPH wi+Ha+yi+ktib+uwA+hA
POS CONJ+FUT_PART+IV3P+IV

+IVSUFF_SUBJ:3P+IVSUFF_DO:3FS
LEM katab

The morphological analyzers we use in the pa-
per, CALIMA (Habash et al., 2012b) and SAMA
(Graff et al., 2009), both generate the different lev-
els of representation discussed above.

4 Automatic Morphological Correction

In this section, we present the effort on auto-
matic morphological correction of rich noisy an-
notations. We next describe the data set we work
with and the problems it has. This is followed by
a discussion of our approach and results including
an error analysis.

4.1 Data
We use a non-final, pre-release version of six man-
ually annotated Egyptian Arabic corpora devel-
oped by the LDC, and labeled as “ARZ”, parts one
through six. The published versions of these cor-
pora (Maamouri et al., 2012a-f) do not include the
annotation errors discussed in this paper. Rather,
in the official releases of the data from the LDC,
such problematic cases with an unknown POS tag
sequence (as in the example at the end of Sec-
tion 4.2) were caught and given a NO_FUNC POS
tag instead, in order to allow syntactic annotation
of the data to proceed, and in order to meet data
publication deadlines. The combined corpus con-
sists of about 274K words. The annotations are
very detailed contextually selected morphological
analyses that include for each RAW word its LEM,
POS, MORPH and DIAC as described earlier. The

LDC used the CALIMA4 Egyptian Arabic mor-
phological analyzer (Habash et al., 2012b) to pro-
vide the annotators with sets of analyses to se-
lect from.5 CALIMA’s non-lexical morphologi-
cal coverage (i.e. model of affixes and stem POS
combinations) is almost complete; and its lexical
entries are of high precision. However, CALIMA
lacks some lexical items, i.e., its lexical recall is
not perfect – Habash et al. (2012b) report coverage
of 84% for basic CALIMA and 92% for CALIMA
extended with SAMA (Graff et al., 2009) (hence-
forth, CALIMA+SAMA or simply the analyzer).6

Many missing entries are a result of spelling vari-
ants that are not modeled in CALIMA. In cases
when CALIMA fails to provide analyses or the
annotators disagree with all the provided analy-
ses, the annotators enter the information manually
or copy and modify CALIMA provided analyses,
which sometimes introduces errors.

For the purpose of this work, we consider
all analyses in the corpus that are in the CAL-
IMA+SAMA morphological analyzer to be cor-
rect. We will not attempt to modify them. Al-
most 30% of the corpus analyses are not in the
analyzer, i.e. analyzer out-of-vocabulary (OOV).
We discuss next the general patterns of these anal-
yses. We refer to the original corpus analyses as
the “Baseline” analyses.

4.2 Patterns of OOV Analyses in Baseline
About 3.3% of all OOV analyses (and 1% of all
corpus words) are tagged as TYPOs.7 We do not
address these cases in this paper.

Over half of the POS OOVs (56%) in the
pre-release data involve a different category of
a nominal (NOUN/NOUN_PROP/ADJ). This is
a well known issue even in MSA. The rest
of the cases involve incorrect feature combina-
tions such as giving the unaccusative verb

Analyzer

5SAMA, the Standard Arabic Morphological Analyzer
(Graff et al., 2009), was used to provide the annotators with
analyses for the MSA tokens.

6In our work, we distinguish between morphological anal-
ysis, which refers to producing the various readings of a word
out of context, and morphological tagging (or disambigua-
tion), which identifies the appropriate analysis in context.

7The rate of TYPO words in the ARZ data is almost 18
times the rate in the MSA PATB data sets.

8The inflected verb Aitnaf∼ið is the passive voice of the
verb with the lemma naf∼að or the active voice of the verb
with the lemma Aitnaf∼ið.



POS DEM_PRON instead of DEM_PRON_FS.
Or the imperative verb @ñ 	ªË @ AilguwA ‘cancel [you
plural]’ the POS CV+CVSUFF_SUBJ:2MS (for
‘you masculine singular’) instead of the correct
CV+CVSUFF_SUBJ:2MP. A tiny percentage of
all POS tags in the corpus (2%) include case-
related variation (e.g. CONJ vs Conj); these add
to type sparsity, but are trivial to handle.

Among LEMs and DIACs, there is consider-
able variation in the Arabic spelling, particularly
involving the spelling of Alif/Hamza forms, the
Egyptian long vowels /e:/ and /o:/ and often re-
quiring adjustment to conform to CODA guide-
lines.9 The following are some examples. Specific
CODA cases include spelling èY» kidah ‘as such’
as @Y» kdA or spelling ø



ñ

�
¯ qawiy [pronounced

/awi/] ‘very’ as ø



ð@ Awy. The preposition éJ

	
¯ fiyh

‘in it’ is incorrectly spelled as fiyuh (allomorphic
form is incorrect). The word �I�
K. bayt ‘house’ is
spelled biyt (long vowel spelling error). And fi-
nally the interjection


B lÂ ‘no!’ is spelled as (the

implausible form) ZÈ la’.
Among LEMs, over 63% of the errors is due

to inconsistency in assigning lemmas of punctu-
ation and digit, a trivial challenge. 29% of the
cases are spelling errors such as those discussed
above. The remaining 10% are due to not follow-
ing the specific format guidelines of lemmas (e.g.,
must be singular, uncliticized, and with a sense id
number). Among DIACs, almost all of the mis-
matches are non-CODA-compliant spelling varia-
tions. One third is Alif/Hamza forms, and another
quarter is long vowel spelling. One eighth involves
diacritic choice.

Combinations of these error types occur,
of course. One extreme case is the pro-
gressive particle prefix bi, which should be
tagged as bi/PROG_PART, but appears addi-
tionally as b/PROG_PART, ba/PROG_PART,
bi/PART_PROG, bi/PRO_PART, and
bi/FUT_PART.

in this example. First, the POS tag is both in-
ternally inconsistent and is inconsistent with the

MORPH choice. The POS has a singular subject
prefix (IV3MS) and a plural subject suffix (IV-
SUFF_SUBJ:P); and the plural subject suffix is
written using the morpheme (+uh), which corre-
sponds to a direct object enclitic. The two mor-
phemes, +uh and +uwA, are homophonous, which
is the most likely cause for this error. Second, the
future marker (Ha+) is written in a non-CODA-
compliant way (ha+) in the analysis. And finally,
the lemma is malformed, containing multiple ex-
tra sense id digits. It is important to point out
that there are multiple ways to correct the anal-
ysis. For example, it can be Ha+yi+Âaj∼il+uh
FUT_PART+IV3MS+IV+IVSUFF_DO:3MS ‘he
will postpone it’.10

4.3 Approach
Our target is to provide correct morphological
analyses for the OOV annotations in the pre-
release version of the ARZ corpus. Since not
all of the OOV annotations are wrong in prin-
ciple, we do not force map them all to CAL-
IMA+SAMA in-vocabulary variants, especially
for open class categories, where we know CAL-
IMA+SAMA may be deficient. As such, our gen-
eral solution focuses on correcting closed classes
(some stems and all of the affixes) by mapping
them to in-vocabulary variants. We also use a set
of language-specific preprocessing corrections for
common orthographic variations (for all open and
closed classes). An important tool we use through-
out to rank choices and break ties is modified Lev-
enshtein edit distance.11

Next, we present the four steps of our correction
process: annotation preprocessing, morpheme-
POS correction, lemma correction and surface
DIAC generation.

Annotation Preprocessing When first reading
the pre-release annotations, we perform a prepro-
cessing step that includes a set of deterministic

10Since our approach currently considers words out of con-
text, such a correction is not preferred because it requires
more character edits (see Figure 2). We acknowledge this
to be a limitation and plan to address it in the future.

11The Levenshtein edit distance is defined as the minimum
number of single-character edits (insertion, deletion and sub-
stitution) required to change one string into the other. For
Arabic words and morphemes, we modify the cost of sub-
stitutions involving two phonologically or orthographically
similar letters to count as half edits. We acquire the list of
such letter substitutions from Eskander et al. (2013), who re-
port them as the most frequent source of errors in Egyptian
Arabic orthography. We map all diacritic-only morphemes
to empty morphemes in both ways at a cost of half edit also.
For POS tag edit distance, we use the standard definition of
Levenshtein edit distance. Edit cost is an area where a lot of
tuning could be done and we plan to explore it in the future.

corrections for common non-CODA-compliant or-
thographic variations and errors, and POS tagging
typos. The corrections apply to the POS tags, lem-
mas, morphemes and surface forms. Examples of
these corrections include the following: reorder-
ing diacritics, e.g., saji∼l→ saj∼il; removing du-
plicate diacritics, e.g., saj∼iil→ saj∼il; adjusting
Alif-Hamza forms to match the diacritics that fol-
low them, e.g., ǍaSl→ ÂaSl; and POS tag capital-
ization, e.g., Fut_Part→ FUT_PART.

Morpheme-POS Correction For morpheme
correction purposes, we define an abstract rep-
resentation that combines all the closed-class
morphemes and POS tags. For open-class
stems, we simply use the POS tag. For exam-
ple, the abstract morpheme representation for
the correct version of the word in Figure 1 is
Ha/FUT_PART+yi/IV3P+IV+uwA/IVSUFF_SUBJ:P.
We will refer to this representation as the inflec-
tional morph-tag (IMT).

We build two models for this task. First, we
build an IMT language model from the CAL-
IMA+SAMA databases. This models all possible
inflections in the analyzer without the open class
stems. This model includes 304K sequences. Sec-
ond, we construct a map from all the seen IMTs
in the ARZ corpus to all the in-vocabulary IMTs
in the IMT language model. The mapping in-
cludes a cost that is based on the edit distance dis-
cussed earlier. Figure 2 shows the top mappings
for the IMTs in our example. Both models are im-
plemented as finite state machines using the ATT
FSM toolkit (Mohri et al., 1998).

The input, possibly incorrect, IMT is con-
verted into an FSM that is then composed
with the mapping transducer and the language
model automaton to generate a cost-ranked list
of mappings. The output for our example is
listed in Figure 3. We then replace the input
POS and MORPH with the top ranked correction:
Ha/FUT_PART+yi/IV3MS+IV+uh/IVSUFF_SUBJ:P
at a cost of 4.0. The open class stem is not modi-
fied.

Lemma Correction We generate a map that in-
cludes all the possible lemmas for every possi-
ble stem morpheme in CALIMA+SAMA. For a
given ARZ word analysis, if the stem morpheme
is in CALIMA+SAMA, then we pick the lemma
from its corresponding lemma set. When there is
more than one possible lemma, we pick the lemma
that is closest to the provided pre-release ARZ
lemma, based on their string edit distance as de-
fined earlier. If the stem morpheme is not in CAL-
IMA+SAMA (e.g., open class), then we keep the
ARZ lemma as it is.

In our example, the stem morpheme Âaj∼il/IV
is paired in CALIMA+SAMA with the lemma
Âaj∼il_1. Accordingly, Âaj∼il_1 replaces the in-



put pre-release ARZ lemma.

Surface DIAC Generation After correcting the
morphemes and POS tags in the input word,
we use them to generate a new surface DIAC
form. For all the closed-class morphemes and
in-vocabulary open-class stems, we use CAL-
IMA+SAMA to identify all the MORPH+POS to
DIAC mappings. For open-class stems that are
OOVs, we use their corresponding DIAC form in
the input word.12 This may lead to many possible
sequences. We rank them by their edit distance
(defined above) to the surface DIAC of the input
word.

In our example, this process is rather trivial:
every morpheme is paired with only one surface
DIAC in the morphological analyzer. The surface
DIACs corresponding to Ha/FUT_PART, yi/IV3P,
Âaj∼il/IV and uwA/IVSUFF_SUBJ:P are Ha, yi,
Âaj∼il and uwA, respectively. The final combined
surface is HayiÂaj∼iluwA.

A more interesting example is the word A 	JJ
Ê«
ςalay+nA ‘upon us’ which has the analysis
ςalaý/PREP+nA/PRON_1P. The MORPH stem
ςalaý has two DIAC forms: ςalaý and ςalay. The
second form is only used when an enclitic is
present. It is selected in this example because it
has a smaller edit distance to the full word input
DIAC form than the surface stem ςalaý. In the
future, we plan to use more sophisticated genera-
tion and detokenization techniques (El Kholy and
Habash, 2010).

4.4 Results and Error Analysis
Results We conducted a manual evaluation for
1,000 words from the internal, pre-release ARZ
after applying the automatic correction process.
This set is a blind test set, i.e., not used as part
of the development. The results are listed in Ta-
ble 1 for the lemmas, POS tags, diacritized mor-
phemes and diacritized surface forms, in addition
to the complete morphological analyses (token-
based), where the correction output is compared
to the pre-release ARZ annotations (the baseline).

The results are listed for different subsets of
the data. The first row lists the results consider-
ing the complete 1,000 words, where all the in-
vocabulary words are considered correct. This is
only intended to give an overall estimate of the
correctness of the set. The second row lists the re-
sults for CALIMA+SAMA OOV words only. The

mine the exact boundary of the surface DIAC stem by mini-
mizing the edit distance between the prefixing/suffixing mor-
phemes and the full input surface DIAC form.

third row is the same as the second, but exclud-
ing punctuations, digits and typos. Focusing on
the last row, we see that we achieve between 58%
and 24% error reduction on different features, and
reach almost 40% error reduction on all features
combined.

Error Analysis For POS, 99.7% of all the cor-
rect cases in the Baseline were not changed. Only
one case was changed and it was caused by an er-
ror in the input MORPH splits. Of the erroneous
cases in the Baseline, 40% were not changed.
Among the attempted changes, 71% successfully
fixed the baseline problem. Almost all of the failed
changes are due to implausible null pronouns in
the Baseline that were not handled in the cur-
rent implementation, which only considered cor-
rect null pronouns. We plan to address these in
the future. Among the errors that were not ad-
dressed, the most common case involves nominal
form (41%) followed by hard features to resolve
and open class passive-voice inconsistency (each
27%).

Regarding lemmas, 93.9% of all correct base-
line lemmas remained correct. In the rest, over-
correction attempts resulting from matching the
OOV lemma to the wrong in-vocabulary lemma
backfired. Around 13.9% of the erroneous base-
line lemmas were not modified and 1.5% were
modified incorrectly. The rest, 84.6%, were suc-
cessfully fixed. Almost all of the system errors
resulting from changes involve over correction by
mapping to incorrect INV lemma forms.

Finally, as for diacritized forms, 96.9% of the
correct baseline DIACs remained correct; the rest
fell victim to over-correction. Among incorrect
baseline cases, 43% remained unchanged; and
45% were fixed; 4% were over-corrected and 8%
only partially corrected. Remaining DIAC errors
are mostly in open classes where the analyzer re-

In this section, we present the general technique
we use to extend shallow annotations. We discuss
the data sets, the approach and evaluation results
next.

5.1 Data
We conduct our experiments on two differ-
ent Egyptian Arabic corpora: the CALLHOME
Egypt (CHE) corpus (Gadalla et al., 1997) and
Carnegie Mellon University Egyptian Arabic cor-
pus (CMUEAC) (Mohamed et al., 2012).

Table 1: Accuracy of the automatic morphological correction of internal, pre-release ARZ data.

CHE The CHE corpus contains 140 telephone
conversation transcripts of about 179K words.
Each word is represented by its phonological form
and undiacritized Arabic script orthography. The
orthography used is quite similar to the CODA
standard we use. Being a transcript corpus, it is
quite clean and free of spelling variations. We use
a technique described in more detail in Habash et
al. (2012b) to combine the phonological form and
undiacritized Arabic script into diacritized Arabic
script, i.e. DIAC. For example, the undiacritized
word é 	JJ
« ςynh ‘his eye’ is combined with its pro-
nunciation /ςe:nu/ producing the diacritized form
ςaynuh.

CMUEAC The CMUEAC corpus includes
about 23K words that are only annotated for
morph splits. The corpus text includes sponta-
neously written Egyptian Arabic text collected off
the web. To use the same example as above, the
word é 	JJ
« ςynh ‘his eye’ is segmented as ςyn+h in-
dicating that there is a base word plus an enclitic.

5.2 Approach
Our approach to morphological extension is to au-
tomatically annotate the corpus using a very rich
morphological tagger, and then use the limited
manual annotations to adjust the morphological
choice. We use a morphological tagger, MADA-
ARZ (Morphological Analysis and Disambigua-
tion for Egyptian Arabic) (Habash et al., 2013).
MADA-ARZ produces, for each input word, a
contextually ranked list of analyses specifying all
the morphological interpretations of that word as
provided by the CALIMA+SAMA morphological
analyzer.

CHE In the case of CHE, we select the first
choice from the ranked list of analyses whose
DIAC matches the diacritized word in CHE. For
example, for the word é 	JJ
« ςynh MADA-ARZ
generates 45 different morphological analyses
with different lemmas, POS, orthographies and

diacritics: ςayn+uh ‘his eye’, ςay∼in+a~ ‘sam-
ple’ and ςay∼in+uh ‘he appointed him’. The
diacritized word ςayn+uh allows us to select the
following full analysis:

RAW Eynh
DIAC Eaynuh
MORPH Eayn+uh
POS NOUN+POSS_PRON_3MS
LEM Eayn_1

Although this example may not require the full
power of a tagger, but just the out-of-context an-
alyzer, other cases involving POS ambiguity un-
realized through diacritization necessitate the use
of a tagger, e.g., the word I.

�
KA¿ kAtib can be

an ADJ meaning ‘writing’ or a NOUN meaning
‘writer/author’.

CMUEAC In the case of CMUEAC, we se-
lect the first choice from the ranked list of anal-
yses whose undiacritized MORPH splits match the
word tokenization. In the case of the word é 	JJ
«
ςyn+h, the tokenization cannot distinguish be-
tween the noun reading ςayn+uh ‘his eye’ and
the verbal reading ςay∼in+uh ‘he appointed him’.
MADA-ARZ effectively selects in such cases.
We expect the performance on CMUEAC to
be worse than CHE given the difference in the
amount of information between the two corpora.

5.3 Results and Error Analysis
We evaluate the accuracy of the morphological
extension process on both CHE and CMUEAC
using two 300 word samples that were manu-
ally enriched. Table 2 presents the accuracies of
the assigned LEMs, POS tags, DIAC forms and
MORPHs, in addition to the complete morpholog-
ical analysis. All results are token-based.

CHE CHE analyses have high accuracies rang-
ing between 95.2% and 97.2% for the different
analysis features, with the complete analysis hav-
ing an accuracy of 92.8%.



Metric CHE CMUEAC
LEM 97.2 82.0
POS 95.2 79.6
MORPH 96.8 77.6
DIAC 97.2 78.4
POS+MORPH 92.8 74.0
All 92.8 72.0

Table 2: Accuracy of automatic morphological ex-
tension of CHE and CMUEAC.

28% of the errors are due to wrong verbal fea-
tures (person, number and gender) for forms that
are not distinguishable in DIAC, e.g., �I�.

�
J» katabt

‘I/you wrote’ and I.
�
Jº

�
K tiktib ‘you write/she

writes’. One fifth of the errors is due to gold di-
acritization errors in the CHE corpus. while 11%
of the errors are because of failure in assigining the
correct diacritization. The rest of the errors are be-
cause of failure in assigning the correct POS tags
for nouns, particles and verbs with percentages of
22%, 11% and 6%, respectively.

CMUEAC CMUEAC analyses have much
lower accuracies compared to CHE, ranging be-
tween 77.6% and 82.0% for different features,
with the complete analysis accuracy at 72.0%. The
CMUEAC is much harder to extend for two rea-
sons: the text, being naturally occurring, con-
tains a lot of orthographic noise; and tokeniza-
tion information is not sufficient to disambiguate
many analyses. For CMUEAC, a quarter of the
errors is due to gold tokenization errors in the
original CMUEAC corpus. Another quarter of
the errors results from MADA-ARZ assigning an
MSA analysis instead of an Egyptian Arabic anal-
ysis.13 Failure to assign the correct POS tags for
particles, verbs and nouns represents 14%, 10%
and 7% of the errors, respectively. Other errors
are because of wrong verbal features (13%) and
wrong diacritization (6%).

As expected, relatively richer annotations (i.e.,
diacritics) are easier to extend to full morpholog-
ical information that relatively poorer annotations
(i.e., tokenization). Of course, the tradeoff is still
there as tokenizations are much easier and cheaper
to annotate. We plan to explore the question of
what would be an optimal set of poor annotations
that can help us extend to the full morphology at
high accuracy in the future.

13MADA-ARZ is trained on a combination of MSA and
Egyptian Arabic text and as such may select an MSA analysis
in cases that are ambiguous.

6 Egyptian Corpus

After applying morphological corrections to pre-
release ARZ and morphological extensions to
CHE and CMUEAC, we have now three big cor-
pora that are automatically adjusted to include
the same rich morphological information, that is:
lemma, POS tag, diacritized morphemes, and dia-
critized surface. We combine the three resources
together in one morphologically rich corpus that
contains about 46K sentences and 447K words,
representing 61K unique lemmas. We intend to
make these automatic corrections and extensions
available in the future to provide extensive sup-
port for Egyptian Arabic processing for different
purposes.

7 Conclusion and Future Work

We presented two methods for automatic correc-
tion and extension of morphological annotations
and demonstrated their success on three different
Egyptian Arabic corpora, which now have annota-
tions that are automatically adjusted to include the
same rich morphological information although at
different degrees of quality that correspond to the
amount of initial information.

In the future, we plan to study how to optimize
the amount of basic information to annotate man-
ually in order to maximize the benefit of auto-
matic extensions. We also plan to provide feed-
back to the annotation process to reduce the per-
centage of errors generated by the annotators, per-
haps through a tighter integration of the correc-
tion/extension techniques with the annotation pro-
cess. We also plan on using the cleaned up corpus
to extend the existing analyzer for Egyptian Ara-
bic.
