Multi-Word Expressions as Discourse Relation Markers (DRMs)

1 Invited Talk Abstract

Usually, by Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs) we mean expressions whose structure and meaning can-
not be derived from their component words as they occur independently. In this talk I will discuss a
different kind of multi-word expressions that behave as discourse relation markers (DRMs), yet do not
seem to belong to well-defined syntactic classes. The apparent open-endedness of these expressions is
a challenge for their automatic identification.1
