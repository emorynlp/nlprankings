Abstract 

This study explores the use of function 
words for authorship attribution in modern 
Chinese (C-FWAA). This study consists of 
three tasks: (1) examine the C-FWAA 
effectiveness in three genres: novel, essay, 
and blog; (2) compare the strength of 
function words as both genre and 
authorship indicators, and explore  the 
genre interference on C-FWAA; (3) 
examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive to 
the time periods when the texts were 
written. 

1 Introduction 
Function words are an important feature set for 
Authorship Attribution (hereafter “AA”) because 
they are considered topic-independent or context-
free, and that they are largely used in an 
unconscious manner (Holmes, 1994; Stamatatos, 
2009; Koppel et al., 2009). The Federalist Papers 
(Mostellar and Wallace, 1964) may be the most 
famous example of AA in English. Mostellar and 
Wallace (1964) conducted a detailed study of 
searching and testing function words to distinguish 
Hamilton and Madison as the authors of the 
disputed Federalist Papers.  

Although Function Word based Authorship 
Attribution (hereafter “FWAA”) has been 
successful in many studies (Stamatatos, 2009), 
Juola (2008) argued that FWAA are mainly 
applied in English texts, and it may not be 
appropriate for other highly inflected languages, 
like Finnish and Turkish. This may not be the case 
in that it is the content words, not the function 
words, that are inflected in those languages. 
However, function words are indeed rarely used 

for AA in non-English texts. It was left out in the 
comprehensive authorship analysis of The Quiet 
Don (in Russian) by Kjetsaa et al. (1984). The 
literature review for this study found several 
examples of FWAA in Modern Greek (Mikros and 
Argiri, 2003) and Arabic (Abbasi and Chen, 2005). 
Overall, the effectiveness of FWAA has not been 
tested on many languages. 

Some studies on FWAA also reported 
negative results. Holmes (1994), in his 
comprehensive survey on authorship attribution, 
cited doubts given by (Damerau, 1975) and 
(Oakman, 1980),  and called for further 
investigation on the stability of function word use 
within an author’s work and between works by the 
same author.  

Another problem for FWAA is to explain 
exactly what authorial characteristics are captured 
by function words, since function words may also 
characterize other textual properties like genre, 
author gender, and even topic, although function 
words are generally considered topic-independent 
or context-free (Stamatatos, 2009; Herring and 
Paolillo, 2006; Clement and Sharp 2003; Mikros 
and Argiri, 2007).  

Clement and Sharp (2003) found that function 
words worked as well as content words in 
identifying document topics. Their further 
investigation showed that author and topic are not 
arbitrarily orthogonal to each other. Using the 
significance level of two-way ANOVA test as 
measure, Mikros and Argiri (2007) found that 
some function words in Modern Greek can 
distinguish both topic and author, providing further 
evidence for possible topic-author correlation 
based on function word dimensions. 

Function words are also used as indicators for 
author gender (Argamon et al., 2002; Koppel et al., 
2003) and text genre (Biber, 1993). Koppel et al. 
(2003) found gender preference on certain personal 

45



pronouns and prepositions. Herring and Paolillo 
(2006) repeated Argamon and Koppel’s 
experiment by mixing genre and gender in the data 
set, and discovered that the same gender indicators 
actually captured genre characteristics. 

In summary, related work has shown that 
function words may contribute to distinguishing 
topic, authorship, author gender, and genre. A 
question soon emerges: which dimension do 
function words characterize the most saliently? In 
other words, given a document set of mixed author, 
topic, and genre, would they interfere with each 
other in classification tasks? Answer to this 
question would help guide experiment design for 
AA tasks, and explain the real authorial 
characteristics captured by function words.  

This paper aims to study the use of function 
words for Chinese authorship attribution (C-
FWAA), since FWAA has not been well-studied in 
Chinese. Existing studies of C-FWAA are limited 
to the analysis of famous authorship dispute cases 
like whether Gao E or Cao Xueqin wrote the last 
40 chapters of the Dream of the Red Chamber, and 
no consensus was reached among these C-FWAA 
studies (Zeng and Zhu, 2006). Therefore no 
baseline was available yet for general-purpose C-
FWAA studies. 

This study consists of three tasks. First, 
examine the effectiveness of C-FWAA in three 
genres of creative writing: novel, essay, and blog. 
Second, compare the strength of function words as 
both genre and authorship indicators, and explore 
the genre interference on C-FWAA. Third, 
examine whether C-FWAA is sensitive to the time 
periods when the texts were written.  

The third task is proposed for a unique reason 
that the influence of ancient Chinese (文言文) on 
modern Chinese (白话文 ) may affect function 
word use. For example, “also” corresponds to “亦” 
in ancient Chinese, and “也” in modern Chinese. 
“的” (“’s” or “of”), “地” (“-ly”), and “得” (“so”) 
are only used in modern Chinese. The government 
of Republic of China (RoC, 1912-1949) and the 
government of People’s Republic of China (PRC, 
1949- ) both made changes to the Chinese 
language. Hence the hypothesis is that Chinese 
function word use may also reflect the time period 
of literary works.  

2 Experiment set up 

2.1 Constructing Chinese function word list  
Various function word lists have been used in AA 
tasks in English, and the selection process usually 
follows arbitrary criteria (Stamatatos, 2009). To 
construct the Chinese function word list, this study 
chose 300 most frequent characters from Jun Da’s 
Modern Chinese Character Frequency List (Du, 
2005), removing the characters that contain solid 
meaning, e.g. “来” (“to come”), and removing all 
personal pronouns, e.g. “我” (“myself”) in that 
they have been known as genre/register indicators 
(Biber, 1993). This screening process resulted in 
35 function words (see Table 1). Detailed English 
translation can be found in (Du, 2005).  

Every text document was then converted to a 
vector of 35 dimensions, each corresponding to 
one function word. The value for each dimension 
is the corresponding function word’s number of 
occurrences per thousand words.

2.2 EM clustering algorithm  
This study chose EM clustering algorithm as the 
main method to evaluate the effectiveness of C-
FWAA. Most AA studies use supervised learning 
methods in that AA is a natural text categorization 
problem. However, training data may not be 
available in many AA tasks, and unsupervised 
learning methods are particularly useful in such 
cases. In addition, this study aims to examine the 
clusters emerging from the data and explain 
whether they represent authors, genres, or time 
periods.  

46



This study uses Weka’s Simple EM 
algorithm for all experiments. This algorithm first 
runs k-Means 10 times with different random 
seeds, and then chooses the partition with minimal 
squared error to start the expectation maximization 
iteration. Weka calculates the clustering accuracy 
as follows: after clustering the data, Weka 
determines the majority class in each cluster and 
prints a confusion matrix showing how many 
errors there would be if the clusters were used 
instead of the true class (Witten et al., 2011). 

2.3 Selecting writers and their works 
To exclude gender’s affect, all writers chosen in 
this study are males. Parallel analysis for female 
writers will be conducted in future work. 

Representative writers from three different time 
periods were selected to examine the relationship 
between time period and function word use. The 
first time period (TP1) is the 1930-40s, when 
modern Chinese replaced ancient Chinese to be the 
main form of writing in China, and before the PRC 
was founded. The second time period (TP2) is the 
1980-90s, after the Cultural Revolution was over. 
The third time period (TP3) is the 2000s, when the 
publishing business has been strongly affected by 
the free-market economy. Three representative 
writers were chosen for each time period. The time 
period from the foundation of PRC (1949) to the 
end of the Cultural Revolution was excluded from 
this study because during that time most literary 
works were written under strong political 
guidelines. Tables 2 and 3 listed the representative 
writers and their selected works. Two long novels 
are separated into chapters in order to test whether 
C-FWAA is able to assign all chapters in a book to 
one cluster. Common English translations of the 
titles are found through Google Search. Chinese 
Pin Yin was provided for hard-to-translate titles. 

All writers have to meet the requirements that 
their works cross at least two genres: fiction (novel) 
and non-fiction (essay). The TP3 (2000s) writers 
should have well-maintained blogs as well. 
Therefore this study will examine C-FWAA 
effectiveness in three genres: novel, essay, and 
blog. 

All electronic copies of the selected works were 
downloaded from online literature repositories 
such as YiFan Public Library1 and TianYa Book2.

3 Experiment and result  

3.1 Test the effectiveness of EM algorithm for 
FWAA 

The first experiment was to test the effectiveness 
of the EM algorithm for FWAA. The famous 
Federalist Papers data set was used as the test case. 
The Federalist Papers experiment was repeated 
using the function words provided in (Mostellar 
and Wallace, 1964). The original Ferderalist 
Papers and their author identifications were 
downloaded from the Library of Congress website4. 
Function words were extracted using a Perl script 
and the word frequencies (per thousand words) 
were calculated. The 85 essays consist of 51 by 
Hamilton, 15 by Madison, 3 jointly by Hamilton

and Madison, 5 by Jay, and 11 with disputed 
authorship. Mosteller and Wallace (1964) 
supported the opinion that Madison wrote all 11 
disputed essays, which is also the mainstream 
opinion among historians. 

In the first round of experiment, Jay’s five 
essays and the three jointly-written ones were 
excluded, making the task easier. The cluster 
number was set to two. EM returned results similar 
to that in (Mostellar and Wallace, 1964) by 
assigning all disputed papers to Madison (Table 4). 
However it did make several mistakes by assigning 
3 Hamilton’s essays to Madison and one 
Madison’s essay to Hamilton, resulting in an 
overall accuracy of (66-4)/66=94% in the not-
disputed subset. 

 
 C0 (Hamilton) C1 (Madison) 
Hamilton 48 3 
Madison 1 14 
Disputed 0 11 

 
Table 4: Hamilton vs. Madison (clustering 

errors in bold) 
 
In the second round Jay’s five essays were 

added to the test data. The cluster number was then 
changed to three. The EM algorithm successfully 
attributed the essays to their real authors with only 
one error (assigning one Madison’s essay to Jay, 
see the confusion matrix in Table 5). It also 
assigned all disputed essays to Madison. The 3-
author AA result in Table 4 seems even better than 
the 2-author AA result, but the difference is small. 

 
 C 0 C1 C 2 
Hamilton 51 0 0 
Madison 0 14 1 
Jay 0 0 5 
Disputed 0 11 0 

  
Table 5: Hamilton vs. Madison vs. Jay 
 
In the third round the three jointly-written 

essays were added to the test data. These jointly-
written essays may resemble either Hamilton or 
Madison, which would result in 3 clusters still, or 
they may exhibit a unique style and thus form a 
new cluster. The test result shows that these three 
jointly-authored essays did confuse the algorithm 

no matter if the cluster number is set to three or 
four. When setting the cluster number to three 
(Table 6), all three joint essays were assigned to 
C2, which also attracted 11 Hamilton’s, 2 
Madison’s, 2 Jay’s, and 1 disputed essays. 
Increasing the cluster number to 4 does not reduce 
the confusion: Hamilton still dominated Cluster 0 
with 40 out of 51 essays in it; C1 is still dominated 
by Madison (13 out of 15) and the disputed essays 
(9 out 11). Jay’s essays were split into C1 and C2. 
This result actually shows that function words are 
highly sensitive to noise like the jointly-written 
essays.

3.2 Chinese FWAA with genre and time 
period controlled  

This section describes the experiments and results 
for task 1: evaluating the effectiveness of C-
FWAA using EM and the 35 Chinese function 
words as features. Controlling the time period and 
genre, the same experiment was repeated for each 
genre and each TP.  

In the first round, the authors within each TP 
were paired up in the novel genre to distinguish 
them, which is expected to be easier than 
distinguishing multiple authors. The results in 
Table 7 show that the authors of TP1 and TP2 
novels are perfectly distinguishable, but those in 
TP3 are not.  

Compared to the writers of TP1 and TP2, 
writers in TP3 face a new market-driven economy. 
Writing-for-profit becomes acceptable and even 
necessary for many writers. TP3 writers like Han 
Han (HH) and Guo JingMing (GJM) obtained huge 
financial success from the publication market. 
Both of them also received doubts regarding the 
authenticity of their works.  

Guo Jingming was found to plagiarize in his 
book Meng Li Hua Luo Zhi Duo Shao, which was 
also not assigned to his main cluster by C-FWAA. 
Guo JingMing founded a writing studio and hired 

48



employees to publish and market his books. He 
publicly admits the existence of “group writing” 
practice in his studio because his name is used 
more as a brand than as an author. 

C-FWAA also encountered difficulty in 
distinguishing Han Han and Shi Kang’s novels. 
This finding is consistent with the fact that Han 
Han publicly acknowledged that his Xiang Shao 
Nian La Fei Chi mimicked Shi Kang’s style. Since 
the beginning of 2012, a huge debate surged in 
Chinese social media over whether Han Han’s 
books and blogs were ghost-penned by his father 
and others. In this striking “crowd-sourcing 
Shelock Holmes” movement, numerous doubts 
were raised based on netizens’ amateur content 
analysis on contradicting statements in Han Han’s 
public videos and different book versions. A 
separate study is undergoing to analyze the stylistic 
similarity between Han Han and the candidate 
pens.  

As described in Section 3.1, FWAA is highly 
sensitive to noise like joint authorship. This may 
explain the low performance of C-FWAA in TP3 
when plagiarism, group writing, and ghostwriting 
are involved.  

After C-FWAA on the novel genre, the same 
experiment was then repeated on the other two 
genres: essay and blog. The results in Table 7 show 
an average accuracy .87 for essays and .83 for 
blogs. Overall, this round of experiment 
demonstrates that C-FWAA is effective in 
distinguishing two authors in all genres and time 
periods.

In the second round C-FWAA was tested on the 
task of distinguishing three authors, also starting 
from the novel genre and TP1. In the 3-cluster 
result (Table 8), C0 is devoted to SCW’s novel 边
城 (Border Town), a masterpiece in Chinese 
literature, C1 captured all other SCW novels, and 
WZQ and QZS remain in C2 together. WZQ and 
QZS were further separated after increasing the 
cluster number to four (with only two errors, 
highlighted in Table 8, of assigning QZS’s two 
works God’s Dream and the Foreword of Fortress 
Besieged to SCW). Two long novels that are 
separated into chapters are also successfully 
assigned into same clusters except for the 
Foreword of Fortress Besieged.  

The 3-author experiment was then repeated on 
TP2 and obtained 100% accurate results.   

The 3-author AA result for TP3 is similar to its 
2-author result: HH and SK remain in one cluster. 
When increasing the cluster number to 4, GJM still 
dominated C0 and C1, but now HH and SK were 
separated into C2 and C3 respectively. 

The C-FWAA accuracy was then calculated by 
choosing the better result from 3-cluster and 4-
cluster experiments (Table 8). Overall, C-FWAA is 
able to distinguish three authors in the novel genre 
effectively.

Table 10: 3-author C-FWAA on Chinese blogs 
 
Comparing the C-FWAA accuracy on three 

genres, we can see that function words are quite 
effective in distinguish writers in all three genres. 
It is the most effective in novels, then essays, and 
blogs are the hardest. One possible explanation is 
that novels are the longest, essays are shorter, and 
blogs are the shortest. Hence novels provide the 
largest amount of data for precise measure of 
authorial characteristics. Further examination is 
needed to test this hypothesis. Another possible 
explanation is that blogs pose less constraint on the 
writers with regard to the writing format, and thus 
writers may write in much freer and more informal 
style. Overall, C-FWAA reached over 80% 
accuracy in distinguishing two or three authors in 
all three genres. This concludes the task #1. 

3.3 Function words as genre indicators with 
author and time period controlled 

This section reports a series of experiments that 
aim to evaluate the effectiveness of function words 
as genre indicators and the genre interference on 
C-FWAA. The first round of experiment examines 
whether the function words can distinguish novels 
from essays in each TP. The cluster number was 
set to two and the clustering result was compared 
against the genre labels. The error analysis also 
reveals which genre is less cohesive (failing to 
hold all of its instances in one cluster).

cohesive?

SK .66 Essay (2->novel) 

 avg .77  
 
Table 11: function words as genre indicator (novel vs. 
essay) 
 

The results in Table 11 show that the average 
accuracy (over 9 authors) is .77 to distinguish an 
author’s novels and essays, demonstrating that 
function words are also strong genre indicators. 
For some authors QZS, WS, and WXB, their 
novels and essays are highly separable based on 
function word use. Interestingly, for all writers, 
their novels hold together perfectly except for GJM, 
but the essays often spread across two clusters. 
Again, the explanation may still be that novels are 
longer than essays, and thus provide more precise 
style estimation. If so, novels and essays may not 
be a fair comparison. However, the lengths of 
essays and blogs are similar. Therefore, the above 
experiment was repeated to distinguish essays and 
blogs from same authors. The results in Table 12 
show that this task is not easier. The average 
accuracy is .71, which is a little worse than .77 in 
distinguishing novels and essays. Once again, one 
genre, this time it is the essay, that hold together 
very well, and blogs spread across clusters.

Combining the results in Section 3.2 and this 
section, we can see that function words are 
indicators of both authorship and genre, and the C-
FWAA performance is affected by genre: it is the 
easiest for novel, then essay, and hardest for blogs.

SK .78 5/14   5/31 
Avg .71 .12 .36

(essay vs. blog) 

3.4 Which one do function words 
characterize more saliently, genre or 
authorship? 

In the experiments reported in this section TP was 
still controlled, but in each TP the three authors 
and two genres are mixed together. The experiment 
was repeated for each TP. Each experiment 
consists of two steps. First, the cluster number was 
set to two, and the clustering result was compared 
against the genre labels. Second, the cluster 
number was set to three, and the result was 
compared against the author labels. If genre plays 
stronger impact on function word use, we should 
see high accuracy in the 2-cluster result, and if 
authorship is more salient, the 3-cluster result 
should be better. The results show that for all three 
TPs, the author-genre mix decreased the 
performance of authorship clustering (column #3 
“AA in mixed genres” vs. column #4 “AA in 
novel” and column #5 “AA in essay”), indicating 
clear genre interference to authorship attribution. 
In comparison, the genre clustering in mixed 
authors (column #1) was worse than genre 
clustering in single author (column #6) in TP1 only. 
In TP2 and TP3 genre clustering in mixed-authors 
yielded higher accuracy than that in single-author, 
showing that mixing authors may increase or 
decrease genre identification performance. 

To better understand the interference between 
authorship and genre, the 3-cluster result for each 
TP was visualized in Figures 1-3. The clusters in 
TP1 (Figure 1) include authorship cluster C0 
(bottom row: SCW), genre cluster C2 (top: essay), 
and mixed cluster C1 (middle: WZQ, QZS, novels, 
and essays), demonstrating competing influence of 

authorship and genre on function words. The 
clusters in TP2 (Figure 2) are more genre-oriented, 
with C0 dominated by novels and C1 and C2 by 
essays. The clusters in TP3 (Figure 3) are also as 
mixed as in TP1, but more authorship-oriented, 
with C0 dominated by Shi Kang, C1 by Guo 
JingMing, and C2 by Han Han. In summary, 
function words characterize authors more saliently 
in TP1 and TP3, and genres more saliently in TP2. 
Therefore, we conclude for task #2 that the level of 
genre interference on authorship attribution is not 
arbitrary but is actually dependent on individual 
data set.

3.5 Is C-FWAA dependent on time period? 
The task #3 is to examine whether C-FWAA is 

dependent on time period. The hypothesis is that 
writers of different times may use the function 
words differently because of the drastic change in 
Mandarin Chinese throughout the 20th century. 
When mixing the novels written in TP1, TP2, and 
TP3, the algorithm may be more sensitive to the 
time period than individual authorship. If the 
hypothesis is true, we should see the clustering 
result aligns with the time period, not authorship or 
genre. This time the cluster number is set to -1, 
which allows EM to use cross validation to 
automatically determine the optimal number of 
clusters (Smyth, 1996; McGregor et al., 2004). 

EM returns 4 clusters: C0 is dominated by QZS 
(1940s), C1 by WZQ, WS, and JPW (1980-90s), 
C2 by SCW (1930s) and WXB (1980-90s), C3 by 
GJM (2000s). Therefore no obvious relationship is 
observed between the clusters and the time periods. 
Further, all TP1 and TP2 writers share one thing in 
common – their works stay in one cluster, but TP3 
writers’ works spread across multiple clusters: 
GJM 2, SK 3, and HH 4. This result is consistent 
with two facts that Han Han publicly 
acknowledged that (1) his Xiang Shao Nian La Fei 
Chi mimicked Shi Kang’s style, and (2) his San 
Chong Men mimicked Qian ZhongShu’s Wei 
Cheng.

Repeating the experiment on essays resulted in 
only two clusters. Most writers’ essays remain in 
one cluster with few exceptions (e.g. SCW, QZS, 
WXB and JPW in C0, and WZQ, WS and GJM in 
C1), while HH and SK’s essays spread across the 
two clusters. The clusters do not seem to relate to 
the time periods either. What do these two clusters 
mean then? An examination of the cluster 
assignment of HH’s essays reveals that his essay 
books Du, Jiu Zhe Yang Piao Lai Piao Qu, and Ke 
Ai De Hong Shui Meng Shou belong to C1, all 
written in casual and conversational style, and the 
more formal essays like Qiu Yi, Shu Dian, Bei 
Zhong Kui Ren, and Yi Qi Chen Mo belong to C1. 
Interestingly, most essays in C1 are doubted to be 
penned by his father. This result suggests that the 
clustering result actually captured two sub-genres 
in essays. However, further analysis is needed to 
test this hypothesis. In summary, no solid 
relationship was found between time period and 
Chinese function word use.

4 Conclusion and limitations 
This study made three contributions. First, it 
examined the effectiveness of using function words 
for Chinese authorship attribution (C-FWAA) in 
three different genres: novel, essay, and blog. 
Overall C-FWAA is able to distinguish three 
authors in each genre with various level of success. 
C-FWAA is the most effective in distinguishing 
authors of novels (averaged accuracy 90%), 
followed by essay (85%), and blog is the hardest 
(68%). Second, this study confirmed that Chinese 
function words are strong indicators of both genre 
and authorship. When the data set mixed authors 
and genres, these two factors may interfere with 
each other, and in such cases it depends on the data 
set which factor do function words characterize 
more saliently. Third, this study examined the 
hypothesized relationship between time period and 

52



Chinese function word use in novels and essays 
between 1930s and 2000s, but did not find 
evidence to support this hypothesis.  

This study has several limitations that need to 
be improved in future work. First, the data set is 
small and not quite balanced. More authors and 
works will be added in the future. Second, the 
random seed for EM is set to the default value 100 
in Weka. However, EM clustering result may vary 
to some extent with different random seeds. More 
rigorous design is needed for robust performance 
comparison. One design is to run each clustering 
experiment multiple times, each time with a 
different random seed. The clustering accuracy 
will be averaged over all runs. This new design 
will allow for performance comparison based on 
paired-sample t-test significance. Third, the 
Cultural Revolution time period is excluded from 
this study due to strong political influence on 
writers. One reviewer pointed out that this time 
period should be valuable for examining the 
relationship between authorship, genre, and time 
period. Relevant data will be collected in future 
study.
