Abstract

We consider the problem of NER in Arabic
Wikipedia, a semisupervised domain adap-
tation setting for which we have no labeled
training data in the target domain. To fa-
cilitate evaluation, we obtain annotations
for articles in four topical groups, allow-
ing annotators to identify domain-specific
entity types in addition to standard cate-
gories. Standard supervised learning on
newswire text leads to poor target-domain
recall. We train a sequence model and show
that a simple modification to the online
learner—a loss function encouraging it to
“arrogantly” favor recall over precision—
substantially improves recall and F1. We
then adapt our model with self-training
on unlabeled target-domain data; enforc-
ing the same recall-oriented bias in the self-
training stage yields marginal gains.1

1 Introduction

This paper considers named entity recognition
(NER) in text that is different from most past re-
search on NER. Specifically, we consider Arabic
Wikipedia articles with diverse topics beyond the
commonly-used news domain. These data chal-
lenge past approaches in two ways:

First, Arabic is a morphologically rich lan-
guage (Habash, 2010). Named entities are ref-
erenced using complex syntactic constructions
(cf. English NEs, which are primarily sequences
of proper nouns). The Arabic script suppresses
most vowels, increasing lexical ambiguity, and
lacks capitalization, a key clue for English NER.

Second, much research has focused on the use
of news text for system building and evaluation.
Wikipedia articles are not news, belonging instead
to a wide range of domains that are not clearly

delineated. One hallmark of this divergence be-
tween Wikipedia and the news domain is a dif-
ference in the distributions of named entities. In-
deed, the classic named entity types (person, or-
ganization, location) may not be the most apt for
articles in other domains (e.g., scientific or social
topics). On the other hand, Wikipedia is a large
dataset, inviting semisupervised approaches.

In this paper, we describe advances on the prob-
lem of NER in Arabic Wikipedia. The techniques
are general and make use of well-understood
building blocks. Our contributions are:

• A small corpus of articles annotated in a new
scheme that provides more freedom for annota-
tors to adapt NE analysis to new domains;
• An “arrogant” learning approach designed to

boost recall in supervised training as well as
self-training; and
• An empirical evaluation of this technique as ap-

plied to a well-established discriminative NER
model and feature set.

Experiments show consistent gains on the chal-
lenging problem of identifying named entities in
Arabic Wikipedia text.

2 Arabic Wikipedia NE Annotation

Most of the effort in NER has been fo-
cused around a small set of domains and
general-purpose entity classes relevant to those
domains—especially the categories PER(SON),
ORG(ANIZATION), and LOC(ATION) (POL),
which are highly prominent in news text. Ara-
bic is no exception: the publicly available NER
corpora—ACE (Walker et al., 2006), ANER (Be-
najiba et al., 2008), and OntoNotes (Hovy et al.,
2006)—all are in the news domain.2 However,

2OntoNotes contains news-related text. ACE includes
some text from blogs. In addition to the POL classes, both
corpora include additional NE classes such as facility, event,
product, vehicle, etc. These entities are infrequent and may
not be comprehensive enough to cover the larger set of pos-

appropriate entity classes will vary widely by do-
main; occurrence rates for entity classes are quite
different in news text vs. Wikipedia, for instance
(Balasuriya et al., 2009). This is abundantly
clear in technical and scientific discourse, where
much of the terminology is domain-specific, but it
holds elsewhere. Non-POL entities in the history
domain, for instance, include important events
(wars, famines) and cultural movements (roman-
ticism). Ignoring such domain-critical entities
likely limits the usefulness of the NE analysis.

Recognizing this limitation, some work on
NER has sought to codify more robust invento-
ries of general-purpose entity types (Sekine et al.,
2002; Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005; Grouin
et al., 2011) or to enumerate domain-specific
types (Settles, 2004; Yao et al., 2003). Coarse,
general-purpose categories have also been used
for semantic tagging of nouns and verbs (Cia-
ramita and Johnson, 2003). Yet as the number
of classes or domains grows, rigorously docu-
menting and organizing the classes—even for a
single language—requires intensive effort. Ide-
ally, an NER system would refine the traditional
classes (Hovy et al., 2011) or identify new entity
classes when they arise in new domains, adapting
to new data. For this reason, we believe it is valu-
able to consider NER systems that identify (but
do not necessarily label) entity mentions, and also
to consider annotation schemes that allow annota-
tors more freedom in defining entity classes.

Our aim in creating an annotated dataset is to
provide a testbed for evaluation of new NER mod-
els. We will use these data as development and

sible NEs (Sekine et al., 2002). Nezda et al. (2006) anno-
tated and evaluated an Arabic NE corpus with an extended
set of 18 classes (including temporal and numeric entities);
this corpus has not been released publicly.

testing examples, but not as training data. In §4
we will discuss our semisupervised approach to
learning, which leverages ACE and ANER data
as an annotated training corpus.

2.1 Annotation Strategy

We conducted a small annotation project on Ara-
bic Wikipedia articles. Two college-educated na-
tive Arabic speakers annotated about 3,000 sen-
tences from 31 articles. We identified four top-
ical areas of interest—history, technology, sci-
ence, and sports—and browsed these topics un-
til we had found 31 articles that we deemed sat-
isfactory on the basis of length (at least 1,000
words), cross-lingual linkages (associated articles
in English, German, and Chinese3), and subjec-
tive judgments of quality. The list of these arti-
cles along with sample NEs are presented in ta-
ble 1. These articles were then preprocessed to
extract main article text (eliminating tables, lists,
info-boxes, captions, etc.) for annotation.

Our approach follows ACE guidelines (LDC,
2005) in identifying NE boundaries and choos-
ing POL tags. In addition to this traditional form
of annotation, annotators were encouraged to ar-
ticulate one to three salient, article-specific en-
tity categories per article. For example, names
of particles (e.g., proton) are highly salient in the
Atom article. Annotators were asked to read the
entire article first, and then to decide which non-
traditional classes of entities would be important
in the context of article. In some cases, annotators
reported using heuristics (such as being proper

3These three languages have the most articles on
Wikipedia. Associated articles here are those that have been
manually hyperlinked from the Arabic page as cross-lingual
correspondences. They are not translations, but if the associ-
ations are accurate, these articles should be topically similar
to the Arabic page that links to them.

nouns or having an English translation which is
conventionally capitalized) to help guide their de-
termination of non-canonical entities and entity
classes. Annotators produced written descriptions
of their classes, including example instances.

This scheme was chosen for its flexibility: in
contrast to a scenario with a fixed ontology, anno-
tators required minimal training beyond the POL
conventions, and did not have to worry about
delineating custom categories precisely enough
that they would extend straightforwardly to other
topics or domains. Of course, we expect inter-
annotator variability to be greater for these open-
ended classification criteria.

2.2 Annotation Quality Evaluation

During annotation, two articles (Prussia and Am-
man) were reserved for training annotators on
the task. Once they were accustomed to anno-
tation, both independently annotated a third ar-
ticle. We used this 4,750-word article (Gulf War,

agreement. Table 2 provides scores for token-
level agreement measures and entity-level F1 be-
tween the two annotated versions of the article.4

These measures indicate strong agreement for
locating and categorizing NEs both at the token
and chunk levels. Closer examination of agree-
ment scores shows that PER and MIS classes have
the lowest rates of agreement. That the mis-
cellaneous class, used for infrequent or article-
specific NEs, receives poor agreement is unsur-
prising. The low agreement on the PER class
seems to be due to the use of titles and descriptive
terms in personal names. Despite explicit guide-
lines to exclude the titles, annotators disagreed on
the inclusion of descriptors that disambiguate the
NE (e.g., the father in H.

�
B@

�
ñK. h. Qk. : George

Bush, the father).
4The position and boundary measures ignore the distinc-

tions between the POLM classes. To avoid artificial inflation
of the token and token position agreement rates, we exclude
the 81% of tokens tagged by both annotators as not belong-
ing to an entity.

one annotator suggested the category. Annotators were

rather, category matches between annotators were de-
termined by post hoc analysis. NAME ROMAN indi-
cates an NE rendered in Roman characters.

2.3 Validating Category Intuitions

To investigate the variability between annotators
with respect to custom category intuitions, we
asked our two annotators to independently read
10 of the articles in the data (scattered across our
four focus domains) and suggest up to 3 custom
categories for each. We assigned short names to
these suggestions, seen in table 3. In 13 cases,
both annotators suggested a category for an article
that was essentially the same (•); three such cat-
egories spanned multiple articles. In three cases
a category was suggested by only one annotator
(◦).5 Thus, we see that our annotators were gen-
erally, but not entirely, consistent with each other
in their creation of custom categories. Further, al-
most all of our article-specific categories corre-
spond to classes in the extended NE taxonomy of
(Sekine et al., 2002), which speaks to the reason-
ableness of both sets of categories—and by exten-
sion, our open-ended annotation process.

Our annotation of named entities outside of the
traditional POL classes creates a useful resource
for entity detection and recognition in new do-
mains. Even the ability to detect non-canonical
types of NEs should help applications such as QA
and MT (Toral et al., 2005; Babych and Hart-
ley, 2003). Possible avenues for future work
include annotating and projecting non-canonical

tors was assigned to each article. Custom categories only
suggested by the other annotator were ignored.

NEs from English articles to their Arabic coun-
terparts (Hassan et al., 2007), automatically clus-
tering non-canonical types of entities into article-
specific or cross-article classes (cf. Frietag, 2004),
or using non-canonical classes to improve the
(author-specified) article categories in Wikipedia.

Hereafter, we merge all article-specific cate-
gories with the generic MIS category. The pro-
portion of entity mentions that are tagged as MIS,
while varying to a large extent by document, is
a major indication of the gulf between the news
data (<10%) and the Wikipedia data (53% for the
development set, 37% for the test set).

Below, we aim to develop entity detection mod-
els that generalize beyond the traditional POL en-
tities. We do not address here the challenges of
automatically classifying entities or inferring non-
canonical groupings.

3 Data

Table 4 summarizes the various corpora used in
this work.6 Our NE-annotated Wikipedia sub-
corpus, described above, consists of several Ara-
bic Wikipedia articles from four focus domains.7

We do not use these for supervised training data;
they serve only as development and test data. A
larger set of Arabic Wikipedia articles, selected
on the basis of quality heuristics, serves as unla-
beled data for semisupervised learning.

Our out-of-domain labeled NE data is drawn
from the ANER (Benajiba et al., 2007) and
ACE-2005 (Walker et al., 2006) newswire cor-
pora. Entity types in this data are POL cate-
gories (PER, ORG, LOC) and MIS. Portions of the
ACE corpus were held out as development and
test data; the remainder is used in training.

4 Models

Our starting point for statistical NER is a feature-
based linear model over sequences, trained using
the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002).8

In addition to lexical and morphological9 fea-

(http://ar.wikipedia.org) on 8/29/2009 and pre-
processed the articles to extract main body text and metadata
using the mwlib package for Python (PediaPress, 2010).

tron and its connection to empirical risk minimization can
be found in the supplementary document.

tures known to work well for Arabic NER (Be-
najiba et al., 2008; Abdul-Hamid and Darwish,
2010), we incorporate some additional features
enabled by Wikipedia. We do not employ a
gazetteer, as the construction of a broad-domain
gazetteer is a significant undertaking orthogo-
nal to the challenges of a new text domain like
Wikipedia.10 A descriptive list of our features is
available in the supplementary document.

We use a first-order structured perceptron; none
of our features consider more than a pair of con-
secutive BIO labels at a time. The model enforces
the constraint that NE sequences must begin with
B (so the bigram 〈O, I〉 is disallowed).

Training this model on ACE and ANER data
achieves performance comparable to the state of
the art (F1-measure11 above 69%), but fares much
worse on our Wikipedia test set (F1-measure
around 47%); details are given in §5.

4.1 Recall-Oriented Perceptron

By augmenting the perceptron’s online update
with a cost function term, we can incorporate a
task-dependent notion of error into the objective,
as with structured SVMs (Taskar et al., 2004;
Tsochantaridis et al., 2005). Let c(y,y′) denote
a measure of error when y is the correct label se-
quence but y′ is predicted. For observed sequence
x and feature weights (model parameters) w, the
structured hinge loss is `hinge(x,y,w) =

max
y′

(
w>g(x,y′) + c(y,y′)

)
−w>g(x,y)

(1)
The maximization problem inside the parentheses
is known as cost-augmented decoding. If c fac-

10A gazetteer ought to yield further improvements in line
with previous findings in NER (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).

11Though optimizing NER systems for F1 has been called
into question (Manning, 2006), no alternative metric has
achieved widespread acceptance in the community.

165



tors similarly to the feature function g(x,y), then
we can increase penalties for y that have more
local mistakes. This raises the learner’s aware-
ness about how it will be evaluated. Incorporat-
ing cost-augmented decoding into the perceptron
leads to this decoding step:

ŷ ← arg max
y′

(
w>g(x,y′) + c(y,y′)

)
, (2)

which amounts to performing stochastic subgradi-
ent ascent on an objective function with the Eq. 1
loss (Ratliff et al., 2006).

In this framework, cost functions can be for-
mulated to distinguish between different types of
errors made during training. For a tag sequence
y = 〈y1, y2, . . . , yM 〉, Gimpel and Smith (2010b)
define word-local cost functions that differently
penalize precision errors (i.e., yi = O ∧ ŷi 6= O
for the ith word), recall errors (yi 6= O∧ ŷi = O),
and entity class/position errors (other cases where
yi 6= ŷi). As will be shown below, a key problem
in cross-domain NER is poor recall, so we will
penalize recall errors more severely:

c(y,y′) =
M∑
i=1


0 if yi = y′i
β if yi 6= O ∧ y′i = O
1 otherwise

(3)

for a penalty parameter β > 1. We call our learner
the “recall-oriented” perceptron (ROP).

We note that Minkov et al. (2006) similarly ex-
plored the recall vs. precision tradeoff in NER.
Their technique was to directly tune the weight
of a single feature—the feature marking O (non-
entity tokens); a lower weight for this feature will
incur a greater penalty for predicting O. Below
we demonstrate that our method, which is less
coarse, is more successful in our setting.12

In our experiments we will show that injecting
“arrogance” into the learner via the recall-oriented
loss function substantially improves recall, espe-
cially for non-POL entities (§5.3).

4.2 Self-Training and Semisupervised
Learning

As we will show experimentally, the differences
between news text and Wikipedia text call for do-
main adaptation. In the case of Arabic Wikipedia,

12The distinction between the techniques is that our cost
function adjusts the whole model in order to perform better
at recall on the training data.

Input: labeled data 〈〈x(n),y(n)〉〉Nn=1; unlabeled
data 〈x̄(j)〉Jj=1; supervised learner L;
number of iterations T ′

Output: w
w← L(〈〈x(n),y(n)〉〉Nn=1)
for t = 1 to T ′ do

for j = 1 to J do
ŷ(j) ← arg maxy w>g(x̄(j),y)

w← L(〈〈x(n),y(n)〉〉Nn=1 ∪ 〈〈x̄(j), ŷ(j)〉〉Jj=1)
Algorithm 1: Self-training.

there is no available labeled training data. Yet
the available unlabeled data is vast, so we turn to
semisupervised learning.

Here we adapt self-training, a simple tech-
nique that leverages a supervised learner (like the
perceptron) to perform semisupervised learning
(Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea, 2004; McClosky
et al., 2006). In our version, a model is trained
on the labeled data, then used to label the un-
labeled target data. We iterate between training
on the hypothetically-labeled target data plus the
original labeled set, and relabeling the target data;
see Algorithm 1. Before self-training, we remove
sentences hypothesized not to contain any named
entity mentions, which we found avoids further
encouragement of the model toward low recall.

5 Experiments

We investigate two questions in the context of
NER for Arabic Wikipedia:

• Loss function: Does integrating a cost func-
tion into our learning algorithm, as we have
done in the recall-oriented perceptron (§4.1),
improve recall and overall performance on
Wikipedia data?
• Semisupervised learning for domain adap-

tation: Can our models benefit from large
amounts of unlabeled Wikipedia data, in addi-
tion to the (out-of-domain) labeled data? We
experiment with a self-training phase following
the fully supervised learning phase.

We report experiments for the possible combi-
nations of the above ideas. These are summarized
in table 5. Note that the recall-oriented percep-
tron can be used for the supervised learning phase,
for the self-training phase, or both. This leaves us
with the following combinations:

• reg/none (baseline): regular supervised learner.
• ROP/none: recall-oriented supervised learner.

166



Figure 1: Tuning the recall-oriented cost parame-
ter for different learning settings. We optimized
for development set F1, choosing penalty β = 200
for recall-oriented supervised learning (in the plot,
ROP/*—this is regardless of whether a stage of
self-training will follow); β = 100 for recall-
oriented self-training following recall-oriented su-
pervised learning (ROP/ROP); and β = 3200 for
recall-oriented self-training following regular super-
vised learning (reg/ROP).

• reg/reg: standard self-training setup.
• ROP/reg: recall-oriented supervised learner, fol-

lowed by standard self-training.
• reg/ROP: regular supervised model as the initial la-

beler for recall-oriented self-training.
• ROP/ROP (the “double ROP” condition): recall-

oriented supervised model as the initial labeler for
recall-oriented self-training. Note that the two
ROPs can use different cost parameters.

For evaluating our models we consider the
named entity detection task, i.e., recognizing
which spans of words constitute entities. This
is measured by per-entity precision, recall, and
F1.13 To measure statistical significance of differ-
ences between models we use Gimpel and Smith’s
(2010) implementation of the paired bootstrap re-
sampler of (Koehn, 2004), taking 10,000 samples
for each comparison.

5.1 Baseline
Our baseline is the perceptron, trained on the
POL entity boundaries in the ACE+ANER cor-
pus (reg/none).14 Development data was used to
select the number of iterations (10). We per-
formed 3-fold cross-validation on the ACE data
and found wide variance in the in-domain entity
detection performance of this model:

P R F1
fold 1 70.43 63.08 66.55
fold 2 87.48 81.13 84.18
fold 3 65.09 51.13 57.27
average 74.33 65.11 69.33

(Fold 1 corresponds to the ACE test set described
in table 4.) We also trained the model to perform
POL detection and classification, achieving nearly
identical results in the 3-way cross-validation of
ACE data. From these data we conclude that our

13Only entity spans that exactly match the gold spans are
counted as correct. We calculated these scores with the
conlleval.pl script from the CoNLL 2003 shared task.

14In keeping with prior work, we ignore non-POL cate-
gories for the ACE evaluation.

baseline is on par with the state of the art for Ara-
bic NER on ACE news text (Abdul-Hamid and
Darwish, 2010).15

Here is the performance of the baseline entity
detection model on our 20-article test set:16

P R F1
technology 60.42 20.26 30.35
science 64.96 25.73 36.86
history 63.09 35.58 45.50
sports 71.66 59.94 65.28
overall 66.30 35.91 46.59

Unsurprisingly, performance on Wikipedia data
varies widely across article domains and is much
lower than in-domain performance. Precision
scores fall between 60% and 72% for all domains,
but recall in most cases is far worse. Miscella-
neous class recall, in particular, suffers badly (un-
der 10%)—which partially accounts for the poor
recall in science and technology articles (they
have by far the highest proportion of MIS entities).

5.2 Self-Training

Following Clark et al. (2003), we applied self-
training as described in Algorithm 1, with the
perceptron as the supervised learner. Our unla-
beled data consists of 397 Arabic Wikipedia ar-
ticles (1 million words) selected at random from
all articles exceeding a simple length threshold
(1,000 words); see table 4. We used only one iter-
ation (T ′ = 1), as experiments on development
data showed no benefit from additional rounds.
Several rounds of self-training hurt performance,

15Abdul-Hamid and Darwish report as their best result a
macroaveraged F1-score of 76. As they do not specify which
data they used for their held-out test set, we cannot perform
a direct comparison. However, our feature set is nearly a
superset of their best feature set, and their result lies well
within the range of results seen in our cross-validation folds.

16Our Wikipedia evaluations use models trained on
POLM entity boundaries in ACE. Per-domain and overall
scores are microaverages across articles.

an effect attested in earlier research (Curran et al.,
2007) and sometimes known as “semantic drift.”

Results are shown in table 5. We find that stan-
dard self-training (the middle column) has very
little impact on performance.17 Why is this the
case? We venture that poor baseline recall and the
domain variability within Wikipedia are to blame.

5.3 Recall-Oriented Learning
The recall-oriented bias can be introduced in ei-
ther or both of the stages of our semisupervised
learning framework: in the supervised learn-
ing phase, modifying the objective of our base-
line (§5.1); and within the self-training algorithm
(§5.2).18 As noted in §4.1, the aim of this ap-
proach is to discourage recall errors (false nega-
tives), which are the chief difficulty for the news
text–trained model in the new domain. We se-
lected the value of the false positive penalty for
cost-augmented decoding, β, using the develop-
ment data (figure 1).

The results in table 5 demonstrate improve-
ments due to the recall-oriented bias in both
stages of learning.19 When used in the super-

17In neither case does regular self-training produce a sig-
nificantly different F1 score than no self-training.

18Standard Viterbi decoding was used to label the data
within the self-training algorithm; note that cost-augmented
decoding only makes sense in learning, not as a prediction
technique, since it deliberately introduces errors relative to a
correct output that must be provided.

19In terms of F1, the worst of the 3 models with the ROP
supervised learner significantly outperforms the best model
with the regular supervised learner (p < 0.005). The im-

vised phase (bottom left cell), the recall gains
are substantial—nearly 9% over the baseline. In-
tegrating this bias within self-training (last col-
umn of the table) produces a more modest im-
provement (less than 3%) relative to the base-
line. In both cases, the improvements to recall
more than compensate for the amount of degra-
dation to precision. This trend is robust: wher-
ever the recall-oriented perceptron is added, we
observe improvements in both recall and F1. Per-
haps surprisingly, these gains are somewhat addi-
tive: using the ROP in both learning phases gives
a small (though not always significant) gain over
alternatives (standard supervised perceptron, no
self-training, or self-training with a standard per-
ceptron). In fact, when the standard supervised
learner is used, recall-oriented self-training suc-
ceeds despite the ineffectiveness of standard self-
training.

Performance breakdowns by (gold) class, fig-
ure 2, and domain, figure 3, further attest to the
robustness of the overall results. The most dra-
matic gains are in miscellaneous class recall—
each form of the recall bias produces an improve-
ment, and using this bias in both the supervised
and self-training phases is clearly most success-
ful for miscellaneous entities. Correspondingly,
the technology and science domains (in which this
class dominates—83% and 61% of mentions, ver-

provements due to self-training are marginal, however: ROP
self-training produces a significant gain only following reg-
ular supervised learning (p < 0.05).

sus 6% and 12% for history and sports, respec-
tively) receive the biggest boost. Still, the gaps
between domains are not entirely removed.

Most improvements relate to the reduction of
false negatives, which fall into three groups:
(a) entities occurring infrequently or partially
in the labeled training data (e.g. uranium);
(b) domain-specific entities sharing lexical or con-
textual features with the POL entities (e.g. Linux,
titanium); and (c) words with Latin characters,
common in the science and technology domains.
(a) and (b) are mostly transliterations into Arabic.

An alternative—and simpler—approach to
controlling the precision-recall tradeoff is the
Minkov et al. (2006) strategy of tuning a single
feature weight subsequent to learning (see §4.1
above). We performed an oracle experiment to
determine how this compares to recall-oriented
learning in our setting. An oracle trained with
the method of Minkov et al. outperforms the three
models in table 5 that use the regular perceptron
for the supervised phase of learning, but under-
performs the supervised ROP conditions.20

Overall, we find that incorporating the recall-
oriented bias in learning is fruitful for adapting to
Wikipedia because the gains in recall outpace the
damage to precision.

6 Discussion

To our knowledge, this work is the first sugges-
tion that substantively modifying the supervised
learning criterion in a resource-rich domain can
reap benefits in subsequent semisupervised appli-
cation in a new domain. Past work has looked

20Tuning the O feature weight to optimize for F1 on our
test set, we found that oracle precision would be 66.2, recall
would be 39.0, and F1 would be 49.1. The F1 score of our
best model is nearly 3 points higher than the Minkov et al.–
style oracle, and over 4 points higher than the non-oracle
version where the development set is used for tuning.

at regularization (Chelba and Acero, 2006) and
feature design (Daumé III, 2007); we alter the
loss function. Not surprisingly, the double-ROP
approach harms performance on the original do-
main (on ACE data, we achieve 55.41% F1, far
below the standard perceptron). Yet we observe
that models can be prepared for adaptation even
before a learner is exposed a new domain, sacri-
ficing performance in the original domain.

The recall-oriented bias is not merely encour-
aging the learner to identify entities already seen
in training. As recall increases, so does the num-
ber of new entity types recovered by the model:
of the 2,070 NE types in the test data that were
never seen in training, only 450 were ever found
by the baseline, versus 588 in the reg/ROP condi-
tion, 632 in the ROP/none condition, and 717 in
the double-ROP condition.

We note finally that our method is a simple
extension to the standard structured perceptron;
cost-augmented inference is often no more ex-
pensive than traditional inference, and the algo-
rithmic change is equivalent to adding one addi-
tional feature. Our recall-oriented cost function
is parameterized by a single value, β; recall is
highly sensitive to the choice of this value (fig-
ure 1 shows how we tuned it on development
data), and thus we anticipate that, in general, such
tuning will be essential to leveraging the benefits
of arrogance.

7 Related Work

Our approach draws on insights from work in
the areas of NER, domain adaptation, NLP with
Wikipedia, and semisupervised learning. As all
are broad areas of research, we highlight only the
most relevant contributions here.

Research in Arabic NER has been focused on
compiling and optimizing the gazetteers and fea-

169



ture sets for standard sequential modeling algo-
rithms (Benajiba et al., 2008; Farber et al., 2008;
Shaalan and Raza, 2008; Abdul-Hamid and Dar-
wish, 2010). We make use of features identi-
fied in this prior work to construct a strong base-
line system. We are unaware of any Arabic NER
work that has addressed diverse text domains like
Wikipedia. Both the English and Arabic ver-
sions of Wikipedia have been used, however, as
resources in service of traditional NER (Kazama
and Torisawa, 2007; Benajiba et al., 2008). Attia
et al. (2010) heuristically induce a mapping be-
tween Arabic Wikipedia and Arabic WordNet to
construct Arabic NE gazetteers.

Balasuriya et al. (2009) highlight the substan-
tial divergence between entities appearing in En-
glish Wikipedia versus traditional corpora, and
the effects of this divergence on NER perfor-
mance. There is evidence that models trained
on Wikipedia data generalize and perform well
on corpora with narrower domains. Nothman
et al. (2009) and Balasuriya et al. (2009) show
that NER models trained on both automatically
and manually annotated Wikipedia corpora per-
form reasonably well on news corpora. The re-
verse scenario does not hold for models trained
on news text, a result we also observe in Arabic
NER. Other work has gone beyond the entity de-
tection problem: Florian et al. (2004) addition-
ally predict within-document entity coreference
for Arabic, Chinese, and English ACE text, while
Cucerzan (2007) aims to resolve every mention
detected in English Wikipedia pages to a canoni-
cal article devoted to the entity in question.

The domain and topic diversity of NEs has been
studied in the framework of domain adaptation
research. A group of these methods use self-
training and select the most informative features
and training instances to adapt a source domain
learner to the new target domain. Wu et al. (2009)
bootstrap the NER leaner with a subset of unla-
beled instances that bridge the source and target
domains. Jiang and Zhai (2006) and Daumé III
(2007) make use of some labeled target-domain
data to tune or augment the features of the source
model towards the target domain. Here, in con-
trast, we use labeled target-domain data only for
tuning and evaluation. Another important dis-
tinction is that domain variation in this prior
work is restricted to topically-related corpora (e.g.
newswire vs. broadcast news), whereas in our

work, major topical differences distinguish the
training and test corpora—and consequently, their
salient NE classes. In these respects our NER
setting is closer to that of Florian et al. (2010),
who recognize English entities in noisy text, (Sur-
deanu et al., 2011), which concerns information
extraction in a topically distinct target domain,
and (Dalton et al., 2011), which addresses English
NER in noisy and topically divergent text.

Self-training (Clark et al., 2003; Mihalcea,
2004; McClosky et al., 2006) is widely used
in NLP and has inspired related techniques that
learn from automatically labeled data (Liang et
al., 2008; Petrov et al., 2010). Our self-training
procedure differs from some others in that we use
all of the automatically labeled examples, rather
than filtering them based on a confidence score.

Cost functions have been used in non-
structured classification settings to penalize cer-
tain types of errors more than others (Chan and
Stolfo, 1998; Domingos, 1999; Kiddon and Brun,
2011). The goal of optimizing our structured NER
model for recall is quite similar to the scenario ex-
plored by Minkov et al. (2006), as noted above.

8 Conclusion

We explored the problem of learning an NER
model suited to domains for which no labeled
training data are available. A loss function to en-
courage recall over precision during supervised
discriminative learning substantially improves re-
call and overall entity detection performance, es-
pecially when combined with a semisupervised
learning regimen incorporating the same bias.
We have also developed a small corpus of Ara-
bic Wikipedia articles via a flexible entity an-
notation scheme spanning four topical domains
(publicly available at http://www.ark.cs.
cmu.edu/AQMAR).
