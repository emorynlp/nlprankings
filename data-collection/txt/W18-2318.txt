Abstract 

A search that is targeted at finding a spe-

cific document in databases is called a 

Single Citation search. Single citation 

searches are particularly important for 

scholarly databases, such as PubMed®, 

because users are frequently searching for 

a specific publication. In this work we de-

scribe SingleCite, a single citation match-

ing system designed to facilitate user’s 

search for a specific document. We report 

on the progress that has been achieved to-

wards building that functionality.  

1 Introduction 

PubMed, a search engine that works on MED-

LINE®, processes on average 3 million queries a 

day and is recognized as a primary tool for schol-

ars in the biomedical field (Falagas, Pitsouni, 

Malietzis, & Pappas, 2008; Lu, 2011; Wildgaard 

& Lund, 2016). Given the significance of Pub-

Med, improving query understanding offers tre-

mendous opportunities for providing better search 

results. In this work we present SingleCite, a sin-

gle citational matching tool designed with the goal 

to improve current single citation searching func-

tionality in PubMed. 

PubMed queries are generally being classified 

as informational or navigational. Informational 

queries, also known as topical searches, such as 

colon cancer, or familial Mediterranean fever, are 

intended to satisfy information needs on a search 

topic. They tend to retrieve many documents, the 

information need is typically not satisfied with 

just one result, and the user does not know in ad-

vance which document will be the most useful. 

Navigational queries, also called known-item 

queries (Ogilvie & Callan, 2003), such as Kat-

anaev AND Cell 2005, 120(1):111-22, are in-

tended to retrieve a specific publication. Pro-

cessing navigational queries requires techniques 

rather different from those used for information 

searches, and includes access to structured cita-

tion data, syntactic parsers, and intelligent 

metadata (volume, issue, page, date fields) 

parsers. Parsing and managing citations is a criti-

cal task of digital libraries and has been studied 

extensively (Anzaroot & McCallum, 2013; Kim, 

Le, & Thoma, 2008; Zhang, Cao, & Yu, 2011). 

Addressing navigational queries is particularly 

important for scholarly citation databases, includ-

ing PubMed, where navigational searches consti-

tute about half of all queries (Islamaj, Murray, 

Névéol, & Lu, 2009; Yeganova, Kim, Comeau, 

Wilbur, & Lu, 2018), unlike general search do-

main where they represent a significantly smaller 

portion (Jansen, Booth, & Spink, 2007). Moreo-

ver, because of specificity of the expected re-

sponse, retrieving the correct document is of great 

importance.  

Users that have a specific document in mind, 

frequently enter a query they believe uniquely 

identifies that document. A specific document 

may be accessed in various ways. Author name(s) 

queries and title queries are two most frequent 

navigational search patterns (Yeganova et al., 

2018). Other search patterns include combina-

tions of author(s), year, key words, journal, vol-

ume, issue, page and date fields. Not all naviga-

tional queries lead to retrieving a single citation. 

Author name queries may retrieve several PMIDs 

written by the same person. Similarly, title queries 

targeted at retrieving a document with a particular 

title, may be interpreted as key words and retrieve 

multiple matching documents. Our single citation 

matching tool is not intended to handle such que-

ries. It is designed for queries that provide enough 

information to establish a high probability match 

between a query and a single correct document. 

When such a document is found, PubMed redi-

rects a user directly to that document, instead of a 

summary page which generally contains many re-

trieved results.

Here we present SingleCite, a single citation 

matching algorithm designed to retrieve a high 

probability match for a navigational query target-

ing a unique document. The algorithm establishes 

a query-document mapping by building a regres-

sion function to predict the probability of a re-

trieved document being the target based on three 

variables: the score of the highest scoring re-

trieved document, the difference in score between 

the two top retrieved documents, and the fraction 

of a query matched by the candidate citation. We 

demonstrate the advantage of our method by com-

paring it with the currently existing single citation 

matching scheme in PubMed and manually anno-

tating a random sample of 1,000 queries on which 

the two methods disagreed. We also apply Single-

Cite on 1 million zero-hit PubMed queries and re-

cover a single citation match for 3.3% of them. 

2 Methods  

To create the mapping between a query and a can-

didate PubMed document we propose an algo-

rithm that predicts the probability of a retrieved 

document being the target given a query. We pro-

pose three variables to measure the success of 

match between a query and a PubMed record: the 

log odds score of the top scoring pmid, the differ-

ence between log odds scores of the two top scor-

ing pmids, and the fraction of alpha-numeric 

query characters that match the record. In the next 

subsection we address the details of how we com-

pute the log odds score between a query and a 

PubMed record. Then we describe how we build 

the regression function that takes as input the three 

variables and predicts the probability of a re-

trieved document being the target. In this work we 

also propose techniques to create artificial que-

ries, where each query is created from a known 

document. This query set is essential for training 

the regression functions in the absence of manu-

ally annotated data. 

2.1   Computing the query-document score  

We represent PubMed documents by their biblio-

graphic data including article title, author 

name(s), journal title, volume, issue, page, and 

date as features. Features from abstracts are not 

used as they are generally not as specific and less 

likely to be the source of a user’s query terminol-

ogy for a single citation. The seven fields of inter-

est will be referred to as citation fields. We index 

the elements of citation fields by including all 

non-stop word single tokens and capitalized stop 

words, that are then lower cased. We also index 

all token pairs with the following exceptions: do 

not include first name or initials alone, do not in-

clude the last page of a page range alone, do not 

include the issue, except as paired with the vol-

ume. 

The features are then weighted with the IDF 

weights approximating naïve Bayesian weights, 

and the resultant weighted features are added up 

for each element of a document matching the 

query. Using these IDF weights we compute the 

log odds score that the matching document is what 

the user was seeking.  

To produce log odds scoring that is as close to 

the truth as possible we make some modifications 

to the weighting. The first problem is that IDF 

weighting is used for both word pairs and single 

words. To correct for this dependency, we modify 

the IDF weights of pairs as follows: 

𝑚𝑜𝑑𝐼𝐷𝐹(𝑤1,𝑤2) = 𝐼𝐷𝐹(𝑤1,𝑤2) − 𝐼𝐷𝐹𝑤1 

We also adjust the IDF weights to correct for 

the unevenness in the amount of dependency 

within fields in the bibliographic record. The un-

evenness is caused by terms in some fields being 

more independent then in others. For example, the 

terms in the author, page, volume, issue and date 

fields tend to be independent of each other. On the 

other hand, in fields such as article titles and jour-

nal titles terms are more dependent. Intuitively, it 

is significantly more difficult to predict author 

first name given the last name, or to predict issue 

given the volume, then to predict a word follow-

ing another word in a title. 

 

Figure 1: Query annotation based on clicked arti-

cle. 

We use a machine annotated training set to op-

timize the weight modification. The machine an-

notated queries are created from NCBI PubMed 

logs by sampling navigational queries that are fol-

lowed by a user clicked document. Given a query 

Query: “Strategies for assessing and fostering 

hope Penrod.J.& Morse.J.M” 

Clicked Article: “Penrod, J., & Morse, J. M. 

(1997). Strategies for assessing and fostering 

hope: The Hope Assessment.” 

Derived Query Parse: Strategies for as-

sessing and fostering hope [Title] Penrod.J. 

[Author] & Morse.J.M [Author].

and a clicked pmid, we interpret the parts of the 

query by mapping them to citation fields of the 

clicked document (title, author, journal, volume, 

issue, page and date). This approach allows us to 

obtain an unlimited amount of citation query–

pmid pairs. Figure 1 presents an example of such 

annotation. Using the machine annotated queries 

as a training set we now modify the IDF weights 

to improve the matching between the query ele-

ments and PubMed citation. To correct for the de-

pendencies within the title fields, we upweight the 

IDF weights for terms coming from all the re-

maining fields by the factor of 1.4. The factor of 

1.4 is empirically determined using a grid search.  

Given a query, we can now score all PubMed 

records and retrieve top ten ranks. As users fre-

quently submit queries with misspelled words 

(Behnert & Lewandowski, 2017) we have incor-

porated spell checking limited to a single edit cor-

rection per term into our processing. This is im-

plemented by retrieving the top ten scoring rec-

ords based on the original query and then applying 

spelling correction to the query one term at a time. 

This may increase the match score between the 

query and a record. If we have increased the dif-

ference between the top score and the next best 

score, the revised query is accepted as the pre-

ferred result. Otherwise the original scores are re-

tained.  

Now that we can compute the scores between a 

query and candidate pmids, the next step is how 

to interpret and combine the scores. To address 

that question we build regression functions to map 

the log odds scores and the fraction of the query 

matched, to the probability the top scoring docu-

ment being the target. Since the training of a re-

gression function requires labeled query-pmid 

pairs, we propose methods for producing artificial 

queries.  

2.2 Artificial Queries 

We propose techniques for creating an artificial 

dataset of annotated citation queries modelled 

upon user’s actual queries. Simulating test collec-

tions for evaluating retrieval quality has been ex-

plored in the literature (Azzopardi & de Rijke, 

2006; Azzopardi, de Rijke, & Balog, 2007) as it 

offers a viable alternative to manually annotating 

queries. Constructing simulated known-item que-

ries present a particularly well-defined task; the 

retrieval goal is the document from which a query 

is constructed.  

We have already shown how to get an unlim-

ited supply of query-document pairs. From each 

such pair, we can take the annotated query as a 

model describing the fields from which the query 

is composed and the length of each such piece. We 

then randomly sample a PubMed document. Us-

ing the pattern of the annotated query, we generate 

a synthetic query from the reference PubMed doc-

ument mimicking the structure of the annotated 

query. For example, if the annotated query con-

tains an author name, we extract an author name 

from the document that is closest in length to the 

author name element in the model query. The 

same technique holds for all the fields found in the 

model query. A second technique randomly se-

lects a PubMed document, creates its citation as a 

text string, and then randomly splits it into two 

strings. Each of these strings then simulates a cut-

and-paste query. 

The advantage of such queries is that we know 

the target document the query is intended to re-

trieve. However, we have no guarantee the query 

will retrieve the document on which it is based. 

Using these two techniques, we created a set of 

one million queries.  

2.3 Training the Regression Functions using 
Artificial Queries 

Based on the synthetic queries which have known 

target documents in PubMed, the goal is to build 

a regression model for estimating the relationship 

between the three dependent variables and the 

predictor. Predictor in this model is label of a 

query document pair, 1 if the document is identi-

fied correctly, and 0 otherwise. For each query we 

carry out retrieval using our system and record the 

top scoring documents from PubMed; x and y rep-

resent values determined by the retrieval as 

x = score1; y = (score1-score2) ⁄ score1.   

To be kept, a score had to be greater than a cer-

tain lower bound and we only record at most 

scores for the top three documents. The first stage 

of our computation is to estimate the probability 

𝑝(𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑀𝑒𝑑|𝑥, 𝑦), where t represents the tar-
get document of the query. We construct the first 

regression function which estimates that probabil-

ity given 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑦. The second stage of the com-
putation is to estimate 𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡 ∈
𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑀𝑒𝑑), the probability that the document at 
rank 1 is the target document. Again, we use all 

the artificial queries and their retrieved documents 

as long as at least two scores were above the 



154

 
 
 

 

threshold to directly estimate 

𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑀). This is obtained by a 
straightforward application of the two-dimen-

sional isotonic regression algorithm (Spouge, 

Wan, & Wilbur, 2003). Consequently, we can 

combine this probability with the previously esti-

mated 𝑝(𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑢𝑏𝑀𝑒𝑑|𝑥, 𝑦) and obtain: 

𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦) = 
𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑀)𝑝(𝑡 ∈ 𝑃𝑀|𝑥, 𝑦). 

Given retrieval results from our system for a 

query, 𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦) provides an estimate of 
how likely the user was looking for document 𝑑1.  

The final step in the model constructs a third re-

gression by taking as input 𝑝(𝑑1 = 𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦) and the 
query fraction matched. We hypothesize that if the 

query is a sufficiently good match to a PubMed rec-

ord and there is a reasonable gap to the next best 

score, the top scoring record may be of interest 

even if not exactly what the user was seeking. We 

conjecture this to depend on the quality of match 

and how much of the query is involved in the 

match. The difficulty however is that we do not 

have a way to simulate this problem with known 

answers. Instead, we compare our system output to 

the output of a legacy system (known to have high 

precision) possessed and currently used by NCBI 

to processes single citation queries. A total of 

343,731 unique queries were collected from Pub-

Med logs on October 12, 2016. These were the que-

ries that triggered the single citation matching sys-

tem in PubMed. The existing system produced a 

presumed high-quality answer for 58,375 queries. 

SingleCite produced probabilistic output of varia-

ble quality for 232,256 of these queries. For the 

51,472 queries where the existing and the new sys-

tem both made predictions, we counted predictions 

as correct when the two systems agreed on the re-

trieved pmid (45,713) and incorrect otherwise 

(5,759). Using this data, we build the regression 

function that combines the probability of top scor-

ing document being the target obtained from previ-

ous step and the fraction of the query matched for 

the 51,472 queries. We empirically chose a thresh-

old of 0.98 and accept predictions from the third 

regression function that are above or at that value. 

3 Evaluation 

We ran SingleCite on the 343,731 query set men-

tioned above, and predicted high probability an-

swers on 26,892 queries (with the 0.98 threshold) 

where the legacy system made no predictions. To 

evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm, we ran-

domly sampled 500 queries from the set where we 

alone made predictions and examined the quality 

of the answers. We found 7 answers clearly wrong 

and 5 probably wrong but potentially useful. 

Wrong answers were mostly seen with the shorter 

queries. These results are consistent with a 98% 

accuracy level. We further randomly sampled 200 

queries from the set of 11,688 queries where the 

legacy system alone made the prediction. There 

we found 22% of answers clearly wrong and 8% 

probably wrong, but potentially useful. The re-

maining 70% of queries produced a single citation 

match that we thought was correct. On close ex-

amination of queries missed by SingleCite, we 

identified a few opportunities for improvement, 

including enriching the index with journal name 

abbreviations (currently index contains only full 

journal names), and better handling of hyphenated 

last names (for example, query containing Shiloh 

did not retrieve the target document containing 

Shiloh-Malawsky as an author).  

As a second experiment, we ran SingleCite on 

one million queries randomly sampled from que-

ries submitted to PubMed in 2017 that produced 

no results using the legacy system. We found a 

single citation match for 3.34% of them. 

4 Conclusion 

Here we present our preliminary work on the sin-

gle citation matching tool aimed to facilitate 

user’s search for a specific document in PubMed. 

The method depends on good feature engineering 

combined with novel approaches for adjusting 

feature weights when combining elements from 

different fields. We also describe how we create 

one million synthetic queries, each along with the 

PMID of the document used as the source. Single-

Cite shows promising results compared to the ex-

isting system for finding single citations. The tool 

can also be used as part of NLP pipeline for iden-

tifying citations in text, abstract or full text, and 

mapping them to corresponding PMIDs. The tool 

can further be useful for citation management sys-

tems and portfolio analysis.
