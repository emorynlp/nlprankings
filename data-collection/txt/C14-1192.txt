Abstract

Translation retrieval aims to find the most likely translation among a set of target-language strings
for a given source-language string. Previous studies consider the single-best translation as a query
for information retrieval, which may result in translation error propagation. To alleviate this
problem, we propose to use the query lattice, which is a compact representation of exponentially
many queries containing translation alternatives. We verified the effectiveness of query lattice
through experiments, where our method explores a much larger search space (from 1 query to
1.24 × 1062 queries), runs much faster (from 0.75 to 0.13 second per sentence), and retrieves
more accurately (from 83.76% to 93.16% in precision) than the standard method based on the
query single-best. In addition, we show that query lattice significantly outperforms the method
of (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) on the task of parallel sentence mining from comparable corpora.

1 Introduction

Translation retrieval aims to search for the most probable translation candidate from a set of target-
language strings for a given source-language string. Early translation retrieval methods were widely
used in example-based and memory-based translation systems (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Nirenburg et al.,
1993; Baldwin and Tanaka, 2000; Baldwin, 2001). Often, the document set is a list of translation records
that are pairs of source-language and target-language strings. Given an input source string, the retrieval
system returns a translation record of maximum similarity to the input on the source side. Although these
methods prove to be effective in example-based and memory-based translation systems, they heavily rely
on parallel corpora that are limited both in size and domain.

More recently, Liu et al. (2012) have proposed a new translation retrieval architecture that depends
only on monolingual corpora. Given an input source string, their system retrieves translation candidates
from a set of target-language sentences. This can be done by combining machine translation (MT) and
information retrieval (IR): machine translation is used to transform the input source string to a coarse
translation, which serves as a query to retrieve the most probable translation in the monolingual corpus.
Therefore, it is possible for translation retrieval to have access to a huge volume of monolingual corpora
that are readily available on the Web.

However, the MT + IR pipeline suffers from the translation error propagation problem. Liu et al.
(2012) use 1-best translations, which are inevitably erroneous due to the ambiguity and structural di-
vergence of natural languages, as queries to the IR module. As a result, translation mistakes will be

propagated to the retrieval process. This situation aggravates when high-accuracy MT systems are not
available for resource-scarce languages.

In this work, we propose to use query lattice in translation retrieval to alleviate the translation error
propagation problem. A query lattice is a compact representation of exponentially many queries. We
design a retrieval algorithm that takes the query lattice as input to search for the most probable translation
candidate from a set of target-language sentences. As compared with Liu et al. (2012), our approach
explores a much larger search space (from 1 query to 1.24× 1062 queries), runs much faster (from 0.75
second per sentence to 0.13), and retrieves more accurately (from 83.76% to 93.16%). We also evaluate
our approach on extracting parallel sentences from comparable corpora. Experiments show that our
translation retrieval system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art parallel corpus mining system.

2 Related Work

Our work is inspired by three research topics: retrieving translation candidates from parallel corpus,
using lattice to compactly represent exponentially many alternatives, and using lattice as query in infor-
mation retrieval.

1. Translation Retrieval using Parallel Corpus. The idea of retrieving translation candidates from
existing texts originated in example-based and memory-based translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990;
Nirenburg et al., 1993; Baldwin and Tanaka, 2000; Baldwin, 2001). As these early efforts use
a parallel corpus (e.g., translation records that are pairs of source-language and target-language
strings), they focus on calculating the similarity between two source-language strings. In contrast,
we evaluate the translational equivalence of a given source string and a target string in a large
monolingual corpus.

2. Lattice in Machine Translation. Lattices have been widely used in machine translation: consider-
ing Chinese word segmentation alternatives (Xu et al., 2005), speech recognition candidates (Mat-
soukas et al., 2007), SCFG (Dyer et al., 2008) and so on in the decoding process, minimum bayes
risk decoding (Tromble et al., 2008), minimum error rate training (Macherey et al., 2008), system
combination (Feng et al., 2009), just to name a few. In this work, we are interested in how to use a
lattice that encodes exponentially many translation candidates as a single query to retrieve similar
target sentences via an information retrieval system.

3. Query Lattice in Information Retrieval. The use of lattices in information retrieval dates back to
Moore (1958). Most current lattice-based IR systems often treat lattices as conceptional hierarchies
or thesauri in formal concept analysis (Priss, 2000; Cheung and Vogel, 2005). In spoken document
retrieval, however, lattices are used as a compact representation of multiple speech recognition
transcripts to estimate the expected counts of words in each document (Saraclar and Sproat, 2004;
Zhou et al., 2006; Chia et al., 2010). Our work is significantly different from previous work that
uses the bag-of-words model because translation retrieval must take structure and dependencies in
text into account to ensure translational equivalence.

3 Query Lattice for Translation Retrieval

3.1 Translation Retrieval

Let f be a source-language string, E be a set of target-language strings, the problem is how to find the
most probable translation ê from E. Note that E is a monolingual corpus rather than a parallel corpus.
Therefore, string matching on the source side (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Nirenburg et al., 1993; Baldwin
and Tanaka, 2000; Baldwin, 2001) does not apply here.

We use P (e|f) to denote the probability that a target-language sentence e is the translation of a source-
language sentence f . As suggested by Liu et al. (2012), it can be decomposed into two sub-models by

2032



introducing a coarse translation q as a hidden variable:

P (e|f) =
∑

q∈Q(f)
P (q, e|f) (1)

=
∑

q∈Q(f)
P (q|f)× P (e|q, f) (2)

where P (q|f) is a translation sub-model, P (e|q, f) is a retrieval sub-model, and Q(f) is the set of all
possible translations of the sentence f . Note that q actually serves as a query to the retrieval sub-model.

To take advantage of various translation and retrieval information sources, we use a log-linear model
(Och and Ney, 2002) to define the conditional probability of a query q and a target sentence e conditioned
on a source sentence f parameterized by a real-valued vector θ:

P (q, e|f ; θ) = exp(θ · h(q, e, f))∑
q′∈Q(f)

∑
e′∈E exp(θ · h(q′, e′, f))

(3)

where h(·) is a vector of feature functions and θ is the corresponding feature weight vector.
Accordingly, the decision rule for the latent variable model is given by

ê = arg max
e∈E

{ ∑
q∈Q(f)

exp(θ · h(q, e, f))
}

(4)

As there are exponentially many queries, it is efficient to approximate the summation over all possible
queries by using maximization instead:

ê ≈ arg max
e∈E

{
max

q∈Q(f)
{
θ · h(q, e, f)}} (5)

Unfortunately, the search space is still prohibitively large since we need to enumerate all possible
queries. Liu et al. (2012) split Eq. (5) into two steps. In the first step, a translation module runs to
produce the 1-best translation q̂ of the input string f as a query:

q̂ ≈ arg max
q∈Q(f)

{
θt · ht(q, e, f)

}
(6)

where ht(·) is a vector of translation features and θt is the corresponding feature weight vector. In the
second step, a monolingual retrieval module takes the 1-best translation q̂ as a query to search for the
target string ê with the highest score:

ê ≈ arg max
e∈E

{
θr · hr(q̂, e, f)

}
(7)

where hr(·) is a vector of retrieval features and θr is the corresponding feature weight vector.
Due to the ambiguity of translation, however, state-of-the-art MT systems are still far from producing

high-quality translations, especially for distantly-related languages. As a result, the 1-best translations
are usually erroneous and potentially introduce retrieval mistakes.

A natural solution is to use n-best lists as queries:

ê ≈ arg max
e∈E

{
max

q∈N(f)
{
θ · h(q, e, f)}} (8)

where N(f) ⊂ T(f) is the n-best translations of the input source sentence f .

Figure 1: Two kinds of query lattices: (a) search graph that is generated after phrase-based decoding and
(b) translation option graph that is generated before decoding. Translation option graph is more compact
and encodes more translation candidates.

Although using n-best lists apparently improves the retrieval accuracy over using 1-best lists, there
are two disadvantages. First, the decision rule in Eq. (8) requires to enumerate all the n translations and
retrieve for n times. In other words, the time complexity increases linearly. Second, an n-best list only
accounts for a tiny fraction of the exponential search space of translation. To make things worse, there
are usually very few variations in n-best translations because of spurious ambiguity - a situation where
multiple derivations give similar or even identical translations.

Therefore, we need to find a more elegant way to enable the retrieval module to explore exponentially
many queries without sacrificing efficiency.

3.2 Query Lattice

We propose to use query lattice to compactly represent exponentially many queries. For example, given
a source sentence “bushi yu shalong juxing huitan”, we can use the search graph produced by a phrase-
based translation system (Koehn et al., 2007) as a lattice to encode exponentially many derivations.

Figure 1(a) shows a search graph for the example source sentence. Each edge is labeled with an
English phrase as well as the corresponding translation feature value vector. Node 0 denotes the starting
node. Node 7 and node 8 are two ending nodes. Each path from the starting node to an ending node
denotes a query. Paths that reach the same node in the lattice correspond to recombined hypotheses
that have equivalent feature histories (e.g., coverage, last generated target words, the end of last covered
source phrase, etc) in phrase-based decoding.

However, there are two problems with using search graph as query lattice. First, it is computationally
expensive to run a phrase-based system to generate search graphs. The time complexity for phrase-based
decoding with beam search is O(n2b) (Koehn et al., 2007), where n is the length of source string and b is
the beam width. Moreover, the memory requirement is usually very high due to language models. As a
result, translation is often two orders of magnitude slower than retrieval. Second, a search graph has too
many “duplicate” edges due to different reordering, which increase the time complexity of retrieval (see
Section 3.3). For example, in Figure 1(a), the English phrase “Sharon” occurs two times due to different
reordering.

Alternatively, we propose to use translation option graph as query lattice. In a phrase-based trans-
lation system, translation options that are phrase pairs matching a substring in the input source string
are collected before decoding. These translation options form a query lattice with monotonic reorder-
ing. Figure 1(b) shows an example translation option graph, in which nodes are sorted according to the
positions of source words. Each edge is labeled with an English phrase as well as the corresponding
translation feature value vector.

We believe that translation option graph has three advantages over search graph:

1. Improved efficiency in translation. Translation option graph requires no decoding.

2. Improved efficiency in retrieval. Translation option graph has no duplicate edges.

10: score(v)← s . Update the Viterbi score
11: end if
12: end for
13: end for
14: end procedure

3. Enlarged search space. Translation option graph represents the entire search space of monotonic
decoding while search graph prunes many translation candidates.

In Figure 1, the search graph has 9 nodes, 10 edges, 4 paths, and 3 distinct translations. In contrast,
the translation option graph has 6 nodes, 9 edges, 10 paths, and 10 distinct translations. Therefore,
translation option graph is more compact and encodes more translation candidates.

Although translation option graph ignores language model and lexcialized reordering models, which
prove to be critical information sources in machine translation, we find that it achieves comparable or
even better retrieval accuracy than search graph (Section 4). This confirms the finding of Liu et al. (2012)
that language model and lexicalized reordering models only have modest effects on translation retrieval.

3.3 Retrieval with Query Lattice
Given a target corpus E and a query lattice L(f) ⊂ Q(f), our goal is to find the target sentence ê with
the highest score θ · h(q, e, f):

ê ≈ arg max
e∈E

{
max

q∈L(f)

{
θ · h(q, e, f)

}}
(9)

Due to the exponentially large search space, we use a coarse-to-fine algorithm to search for the target
sentence with the highest score, as shown in Algorithm 1. We use an example to illustrate the basic idea.
Given an input source sentence “bushi yu shalong juxing le huitan”, our system first generates a query
lattice like Figure 1(a). It is non-trivial to directly feed the query lattice to a retrieval system. Instead, we
would like to first collect all distinct words in the lattice: {“Bush”, “and” , “Sharon”, “held”, “a”, “talk”,
“talks”, “with”}. This set serves as a coarse single query and the retrieval system returns a list of target
sentences that contain these words:

Table 1: The datasets for the retrieval evaluation. The training set is used to train the phrase-based
translation model and language model for Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). The development set is used
to optimize feature weights using the minimum-error-rate algorithm (Och, 2003). A development set
consists of a query set and a document set. The test set is used to evaluate the retrieval accuracy. To
examine the effect of domains on retrieval performance, we used two development and test sets: in-
domain and out-domain.

President Bush gave a talk at a meeting
Bush held a meeting with Sharon
Sharon and Bush attended a meeting held at London

Note that as a retrieval system usually ignores the structural dependencies in text, the retrieved sentences
(scored by retrieval features) are relevant but not necessarily translations of the input. Therefore, we
can match each retrieved sentence against the query lattice to find a path with the highest score using
additional translation features. For example, the Viterbi path for “Bush held a meeting with Sharon” in
Figure 1(a) is “Bush held talks with Sharon”. The translation features of matched arcs in the path are
collected to compute the overall score according to Eq. (9). Finally, the algorithm returns a sorted list:

Bush held a meeting with Sharon
President Bush gave a talk at a meeting
Sharon and Bush attended a meeting held at London

More formally, the input of Algorithm 1 are a query lattice L(f), a target corpus E, and a parameter
k (line 1). The function GETWORDS simply collects all the distinct words appearing in the lattice (line
2), which are used for constructing a coarse boolean query Q. Then, the function RETRIEVE runs to
retrieve the top-k target sentences Ek in the target corpus E only using standard IR features according
to the query Q (line 3). These first two steps eliminate most unlikely candidates and return a coarse set
of target sentence candidates efficiently. 1 Then, a procedure FINDPATH(L(f), e) runs to search for the
translation with the highest score for each candidate (lines 4-6). Finally, the algorithm returns the sorted
list of target sentences (lines 7-9).

Algorithm 2 shows the procedure FINDPATH(L(f), e), which searches for the path with higher score
using a Viterbi-style algorithm. The function COMPUTESCORE scores an edge according to the Eq. (9)
which linearly combines the translation and retrieval features.

Generally, the lattice-based retrieval algorithm has a time complexity of O(k|E|), where |E| is the
number of edges in the lattice.

4 Experiments

In this section, we try to answer two questions:

1. Does using query lattices improve translation retrieval accuracy over using n-best lists?

2. How does translation retrieval benefit other end-to-end NLP tasks such as machine translation?
1In our experiments, we set the parameter k to 500 as a larger value of k does not give significant improvements but introduce

more noises.

Accordingly, we evaluated our system in two tasks: translation retrieval (Section 4.1) and parallel
corpus mining (Section 4.2).

4.1 Evaluation on Translation Retrieval
4.1.1 Experimental Setup
In this section, we evaluate the accuracy of translation retrieval: given a query set (i.e., source sentences),
our system returns a sorted list of target sentences. The evaluation metrics include precision@n and
recall.

The datasets for the retrieval evaluation are summarized in Table 1. The training set, which is used to
train the phrase-based translation model and language model for the-state-of-the-art phrase-based system
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), contains 1.21M Chinese-English sentences with 32.0M Chinese words and
35.2M English words. We used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 4-gram language model on
the English side of the training corpus. The development set, which is used to optimize feature weights
using the minimum-error-rate algorithm (Och, 2003), consists of query set and a document set. We
sampled 5K parallel sentences randomly, in which 5K Chinese sentences are used as queries and half
of their parallelled English sentences(2.5K) mixed with other English sentences(2.3M) as the retrieval
document set. As a result, we can compute precision and recall in a noisy setting. The test set is used
to compute retrieval evaluation metrics. To examine the effect of domains on retrieval performance, we
used two data sets: in-domain and out-domain. The in-domain development and test sets are close to
the training set while the out-domain data sets are not.

We compare three variants of translation retrieval: 1-best list, n-best list, and lattice. For query lattice,
we further distinguish between search graph and translation option graph. They are generated by Moses
with the default setting.

We use both translation and retrieval features in the experiments. The translation features include
phrase translation probabilities, phrase penalty, distance-based and lexicalized reordering models, lan-
guage models, and word penalty. Besides the conventional IR features such as term frequency and
inverse document frequency, we use five additional featured derived from BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002):
the n-gram matching precisions between query and retrieved target sentence (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and brevity
penalty. These features impose structural constraints on retrieval and ensure translation closeness of re-
trieved target sentences. The minimum-error-rate algorithm supports a variety of loss functions. The loss
function we used in our experiment is 1−P@n. Note that using translation option graph as query lattice
does not include language models and distance-based lexicalized reordering models as features.

4.1.2 Evaluation Results
Table 2 shows the results on the in-domain test set. The “# candidates” column gives the number of
translation candidates explored by the retrieval module for each source sentence on average. The lattices,
either generated by search graph or by translation options, contain exponentially many candidates. We
find that using lattices dramatically improves the precisions over using 1-best and n-best lists. All the
improvements over 1-best and n-best lists are significant statistically. The 1-best, n-best, and the search
graph lattice share with the same translation time: 5,640 seconds for translating 5,000 queries. Note
that the translation time is zero for the translation option graph because it does not need phrase-based
decoding. For retrieval, the time cost for the n-best list method generally increases linearly. As the search
graph lattice contains many edges, the retrieval time increases by an order of magnitude as compared
with 100-best list. An interesting finding is that using translation options as a lattice contains more
candidates and consumes much less time for retrieval than using search graph as a lattice. One possible
reason is that a search graph generated by Moses usually contains many redundant edges. For example,
Figure 1 is actually a search graph and many phrases occurs multiple times in the lattice (e.g., “and”
and “Sharon”). In contrast, a lattice built by translation options hardly has any redundant edges but
still represents exponentially many possible translations. We can also see that the lattice constructed by
search graph considering language model can benefit the precision much, especially when n is little. But
this advantage decreases with n increasing and the time consumed by translation options as lattice is
much less than the search graph as lattice. Besides, the margin between them is not too large so we can

abandon some little precision for obtain the large time reducing. Therefore, using translation options as
lattices seems to be both effective and efficient.

Table 3 shows the results on the out-of-domain test set. While the precisions for all methods drop, the
margins between lattice-based retrieval and n-best list retrieval increase, suggesting that lattice-based
methods are more robust when dealing with noisy datasets.

Figures 2 and 3 show the Precision-Recall curves on the in-domain and out-of-domain test sets. As
the query set is derived from parallel sentences, recall can be computed in our experiments. The curves
show that using lattices clearly outperforms using 1-best and n-best lists. The margins are larger on the
out-of-domain test set.

4.2 Evaluation on Parallel Corpus Mining

In this section, we evaluate translation retrieval on the parallel corpus mining task: extracting a parallel
corpus from a comparable corpus.

4.2.1 Experimental Setup
The comparable corpus for extracting parallel sentences contains news articles published by Xinhua
News Agency from 1995 to 2010. Table 4 shows the detailed statistics. There are 1.2M Chinese and
1.7M English articles.

We re-implemented the method as described in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) as the baseline system.

Table 5: Comparison of BLEU scores using parallel corpora extracted by the baseline and our system.
Given a comparable corpus (see Table 4), both systems extract parallel corpora that are used for training
phrase-base models (Koehn et al., 2007). The baseline system is a re-implementation of the method
described in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005). Our system uses translation option graph as query lattice.
Our system significantly outperforms the baseline for various sizes.

It assigned a score to each sentence pair using a classifier. Our system used translation option graph as
query lattices due to its simplicity and effectiveness. For each source sentence in the comparable corpus,
our system retrieved the top target sentence together with a score.

To evaluate the quality of extracted parallel corpus, we trained phrase-based models on it and ran
Moses on NIST datasets. The development set is the NIST 2005 test set and the test set is the NIST 2006
test set. The final evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU-4.

4.2.2 Evaluation Results

Table 5 shows the comparison of BLEU scores using parallel corpora extracted by the baseline and our
system. We find that our system significantly outperforms the baseline for various parallel corpus sizes.
This finding suggests that using lattice to compactly represent exponentially many alternatives does help
to alleviate the translation error propagation problem and identify parallel sentences of high translational
equivalence.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we propose to use query lattice to address the translation error propagation problem in
translation retrieval. Two kinds of query lattices are used in our experiments: search graph and translation
option graph. We show that translation option graph is more compact and represents a much larger
search space. Our experiments on Chinese-English datasets show that using query lattices significantly
outperforms using n-best lists in the retrieval task. Moreover, we show that translation retrieval is capable
of extracting high-quality parallel corpora from a comparable corpus. In the future, we plan to apply
our approach to retrieving translation candidates directly from the Web, which can be seen as a huge
monolingual corpus.
