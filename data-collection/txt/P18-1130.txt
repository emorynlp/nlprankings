Abstract

We introduce a novel architecture for de-
pendency parsing: stack-pointer networks
(STACKPTR). Combining pointer net-
works (Vinyals et al., 2015) with an in-
ternal stack, the proposed model first
reads and encodes the whole sentence,
then builds the dependency tree top-down
(from root-to-leaf) in a depth-first fashion.
The stack tracks the status of the depth-
first search and the pointer networks se-
lect one child for the word at the top of
the stack at each step. The STACKPTR
parser benefits from the information of the
whole sentence and all previously derived
subtree structures, and removes the left-
to-right restriction in classical transition-
based parsers. Yet, the number of steps for
building any (including non-projective)
parse tree is linear in the length of the sen-
tence just as other transition-based parsers,
yielding an efficient decoding algorithm
with O(n2) time complexity. We evalu-
ate our model on 29 treebanks spanning 20
languages and different dependency anno-
tation schemas, and achieve state-of-the-
art performance on 21 of them.

1 Introduction

Dependency parsing, which predicts the existence
and type of linguistic dependency relations be-
tween words, is a first step towards deep language
understanding. Its importance is widely recog-
nized in the natural language processing (NLP)
community, with it benefiting a wide range of
NLP applications, such as coreference resolu-
tion (Ng, 2010; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Ma et al.,

∗Work done while at Carnegie Mellon University.

2016), sentiment analysis (Tai et al., 2015), ma-
chine translation (Bastings et al., 2017), informa-
tion extraction (Nguyen et al., 2009; Angeli et al.,
2015; Peng et al., 2017), word sense disambigua-
tion (Fauceglia et al., 2015), and low-resource lan-
guages processing (McDonald et al., 2013; Ma and
Xia, 2014). There are two dominant approaches to
dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006;
Nivre et al., 2007): local and greedy transition-
based algorithms (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003;
Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Zhang and Nivre, 2011;
Chen and Manning, 2014), and the globally opti-
mized graph-based algorithms (Eisner, 1996; Mc-
Donald et al., 2005a,b; Koo and Collins, 2010).

Transition-based dependency parsers read
words sequentially (commonly from left-to-right)
and build dependency trees incrementally by
making series of multiple choice decisions. The
advantage of this formalism is that the number of
operations required to build any projective parse
tree is linear with respect to the length of the sen-
tence. The challenge, however, is that the decision
made at each step is based on local information,
leading to error propagation and worse perfor-
mance compared to graph-based parsers on root
and long dependencies (McDonald and Nivre,
2011). Previous studies have explored solutions
to address this challenge. Stack LSTMs (Dyer
et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015, 2016) are
capable of learning representations of the parser
state that are sensitive to the complete contents of
the parser’s state. Andor et al. (2016) proposed a
globally normalized transition model to replace
the locally normalized classifier. However, the
parsing accuracy is still behind state-of-the-art
graph-based parsers (Dozat and Manning, 2017).

Graph-based dependency parsers, on the other
hand, learn scoring functions for parse trees and
perform exhaustive search over all possible trees
for a sentence to find the globally highest scoring

tree. Incorporating this global search algorithm
with distributed representations learned from neu-
ral networks, neural graph-based parsers (Kiper-
wasser and Goldberg, 2016; Wang and Chang,
2016; Kuncoro et al., 2016; Dozat and Manning,
2017) have achieved the state-of-the-art accura-
cies on a number of treebanks in different lan-
guages. Nevertheless, these models, while accu-
rate, are usually slow (e.g. decoding is O(n3)
time complexity for first-order models (McDonald
et al., 2005a,b) and higher polynomials for higher-
order models (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Koo
and Collins, 2010; Ma and Zhao, 2012b,a)).

In this paper, we propose a novel neural net-
work architecture for dependency parsing, stack-
pointer networks (STACKPTR). STACKPTR is
a transition-based architecture, with the corre-
sponding asymptotic efficiency, but still main-
tains a global view of the sentence that proves es-
sential for achieving competitive accuracy. Our
STACKPTR parser has a pointer network (Vinyals
et al., 2015) as its backbone, and is equipped
with an internal stack to maintain the order of
head words in tree structures. The STACKPTR
parser performs parsing in an incremental, top-
down, depth-first fashion; at each step, it gener-
ates an arc by assigning a child for the head word
at the top of the internal stack. This architecture
makes it possible to capture information from the
whole sentence and all the previously derived sub-
trees, while maintaining a number of parsing steps
linear in the sentence length.

We evaluate our parser on 29 treebanks across
20 languages and different dependency annotation
schemas, and achieve state-of-the-art performance
on 21 of them. The contributions of this work are
summarized as follows:

(i) We propose a neural network architecture for
dependency parsing that is simple, effective,
and efficient.

(ii) Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets
over 20 languages show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 21
different treebanks1.

(iii) Comprehensive error analysis is conducted
to compare the proposed method to a strong
graph-based baseline using biaffine atten-
tion (Dozat and Manning, 2017).

2 Background

We first briefly describe the task of dependency
parsing, setup the notation, and review Pointer
Networks (Vinyals et al., 2015).

2.1 Dependency Parsing and Notations
Dependency trees represent syntactic relationships
between words in the sentences through labeled
directed edges between head words and their de-
pendents. Figure 1 (a) shows a dependency tree
for the sentence, “But there were no buyers”.

In this paper, we will use the following notation:
Input: x = {w1, . . . , wn} represents a generic

sentence, where wi is the ith word.
Output: y = {p1, p2, · · · , pk} represents a

generic (possibly non-projective) dependency tree,
where each path pi = $, wi,1, wi,2, · · · , wi,li is a
sequence of words from the root to a leaf. “$” is
an universal virtual root that is added to each tree.

Stack: σ denotes a stack configuration, which
is a sequence of words. We use σ|w to represent
a stack configuration that pushes word w into the
stack σ.

Children: ch(wi) denotes the list of all the chil-
dren (modifiers) of word wi.

2.2 Pointer Networks
Pointer Networks (PTR-NET) (Vinyals et al.,
2015) are a variety of neural network capable of
learning the conditional probability of an output
sequence with elements that are discrete tokens
corresponding to positions in an input sequence.
This model cannot be trivially expressed by stan-
dard sequence-to-sequence networks (Sutskever
et al., 2014) due to the variable number of input
positions in each sentence. PTR-NET solves the
problem by using attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015;
Luong et al., 2015) as a pointer to select a member
of the input sequence as the output.

Formally, the words of the sentence x are fed
one-by-one into the encoder (a multiple-layer bi-
directional RNN), producing a sequence of en-
coder hidden states si. At each time step t, the
decoder (a uni-directional RNN) receives the input
from last step and outputs decoder hidden state ht.
The attention vector at is calculated as follows:

eti = score(ht, si)
at = softmax (et)

(1)

where score(·, ·) is the attention scoring function,
which has several variations such as dot-product,

concatenation, and biaffine (Luong et al., 2015).
PTR-NET regards the attention vector at as a prob-
ability distribution over the source words, i.e. it
uses ati as pointers to select the input elements.

3 Stack-Pointer Networks

3.1 Overview

Similarly to PTR-NET, STACKPTR first reads the
whole sentence and encodes each word into the
encoder hidden state si. The internal stack σ is
always initialized with the root symbol $. At each
time step t, the decoder receives the input vector
corresponding to the top element of the stack σ
(the head wordwp where p is the word index), gen-
erates the hidden state ht, and computes the atten-
tion vector at using Eq. (1). The parser chooses a
specific position c according to the attention scores
in at to generate a new dependency arc (wh, wc)
by selecting wc as a child of wh. Then the parser
pushes wc onto the stack, i.e. σ → σ|wc, and goes
to the next step. At one step if the parser points wh
to itself, i.e. c = h, it indicates that all children
of the head word wh have already been selected.
Then the parser goes to the next step by popping
wh out of σ.

At test time, in order to guarantee a valid de-
pendency tree containing all the words in the in-
put sentences exactly once, the decoder maintains
a list of “available” words. At each decoding step,
the parser selects a child for the current head word,

and removes the child from the list of available
words to make sure that it cannot be selected as a
child of other head words.

For head words with multiple children, it is pos-
sible that there is more than one valid selection
for each time step. In order to define a determin-
istic decoding process to make sure that there is
only one ground-truth choice at each step (which
is necessary for simple maximum likelihood esti-
mation), a predefined order for each ch(wi) needs
to be introduced. The predefined order of chil-
dren can have different alternatives, such as left-
to-right or inside-out2. In this paper, we adopt
the inside-out order3 since it enables us to utilize
second-order sibling information, which has been
proven beneficial for parsing performance (Mc-
Donald and Pereira, 2006; Koo and Collins, 2010)
(see § 3.4 for details). Figure 1 (b) depicts the ar-
chitecture of STACKPTR and the decoding proce-
dure for the example sentence in Figure 1 (a).

3.2 Encoder

The encoder of our parsing model is based on the
bi-directional LSTM-CNN architecture (BLSTM-
CNNs) (Chiu and Nichols, 2016; Ma and Hovy,
2016) where CNNs encode character-level infor-
mation of a word into its character-level repre-

2Order the children by the distances to the head word on
the left side, then the right side.

3We also tried left-to-right order which obtained worse
parsing accuracy than inside-out.

sentation and BLSTM models context informa-
tion of each word. Formally, for each word, the
CNN, with character embeddings as inputs, en-
codes the character-level representation. Then the
character-level representation vector is concate-
nated with the word embedding vector to feed into
the BLSTM network. To enrich word-level infor-
mation, we also use POS embeddings. Finally, the
encoder outputs a sequence of hidden states si.

3.3 Decoder

The decoder for our parser is a uni-directional
LSTM. Different from previous work (Bahdanau
et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015) which uses word
embeddings of the previous word as the input to
the decoder, our decoder receives the encoder hid-
den state vector (si) of the top element in the stack
σ (see Figure 1 (b)). Compared to word embed-
dings, the encoder hidden states contain more con-
textual information, benefiting both the training
and decoding procedures. The decoder produces a
sequence of decoder hidden states hi, one for each
decoding step.

3.4 Higher-order Information

As mentioned before, our parser is capable of uti-
lizing higher-order information. In this paper, we
incorporate two kinds of higher-order structures
— grandparent and sibling. A sibling structure
is a head word with two successive modifiers, and
a grandparent structure is a pair of dependencies
connected head-to-tail:

To utilize higher-order information, the de-

coder’s input at each step is the sum of the encoder
hidden states of three words:

βt = sh + sg + ss

where βt is the input vector of decoder at time
t and h, g, s are the indices of the head word
and its grandparent and sibling, respectively. Fig-
ure 1 (b) illustrates the details. Here we use the
element-wise sum operation instead of concatena-
tion because it does not increase the dimension of
the input vector βt, thus introducing no additional
model parameters.

3.5 Biaffine Attention Mechanism
For attention score function (Eq. (1)), we adopt the
biaffine attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015;
Dozat and Manning, 2017):

eti = h
T
t Wsi +U

Tht +V
T si + b

where W,U,V, b are parameters, denoting the
weight matrix of the bi-linear term, the two weight
vectors of the linear terms, and the bias vector.

As discussed in Dozat and Manning (2017), ap-
plying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to the out-
put vectors of the BLSTM before the score func-
tion can both reduce the dimensionality and over-
fitting of the model. We follow this work by using
a one-layer perceptron to si and hi with elu (Clev-
ert et al., 2015) as its activation function.

Similarly, the dependency label classifier also
uses a biaffine function to score each label, given
the head word vector ht and child vector si as in-
puts. Again, we use MLPs to transform ht and si
before feeding them into the classifier.

3.6 Training Objectives
The STACKPTR parser is trained to optimize the
probability of the dependency trees given sen-
tences: Pθ(y|x), which can be factorized as:

Pθ(y|x) =
k∏
i=1

Pθ(pi|p<i,x)

=
k∏
i=1

li∏
j=1

Pθ(ci,j |ci,<j , p<i,x),
(2)

where θ represents model parameters. p<i denotes
the preceding paths that have already been gener-
ated. ci,j represents the jth word in pi and ci,<j
denotes all the proceeding words on the path pi.
Thus, the STACKPTR parser is an autoregressive
model, like sequence-to-sequence models, but it
factors the distribution according to a top-down
tree structure as opposed to a left-to-right chain.
We define Pθ(ci,j |ci,<j , p<i,x) = at, where atten-
tion vector at (of dimension n) is used as the dis-
tribution over the indices of words in a sentence.

Arc Prediction Our parser is trained by optimiz-
ing the conditional likelihood in Eq (2), which is
implemented as the cross-entropy loss.

Label Prediction We train a separated multi-
class classifier in parallel to predict the depen-
dency labels. Following Dozat and Manning
(2017), the classifier takes the information of the



1407

head word and its child as features. The label clas-
sifier is trained simultaneously with the parser by
optimizing the sum of their objectives.

3.7 Discussion

Time Complexity. The number of decoding
steps to build a parse tree for a sentence of length
n is 2n−1, linear in n. Together with the attention
mechanism (at each step, we need to compute the
attention vector at, whose runtime is O(n)), the
time complexity of decoding algorithm is O(n2),
which is more efficient than graph-based parsers
that have O(n3) or worse complexity when using
dynamic programming or maximum spanning tree
(MST) decoding algorithms.

Top-down Parsing. When humans comprehend
a natural language sentence, they arguably do it
in an incremental, left-to-right manner. How-
ever, when humans consciously annotate a sen-
tence with syntactic structure, they rarely ever pro-
cess in fixed left-to-right order. Rather, they start
by reading the whole sentence, then seeking the
main predicates, jumping back-and-forth over the
sentence and recursively proceeding to the sub-
tree structures governed by certain head words.
Our parser follows a similar kind of annotation
process: starting from reading the whole sentence,
and processing in a top-down manner by finding
the main predicates first and only then search for
sub-trees governed by them. When making latter
decisions, the parser has access to the entire struc-
ture built in earlier steps.

3.8 Implementation Details

Pre-trained Word Embeddings. For all the
parsing models in different languages, we initial-
ize word vectors with pretrained word embed-
dings. For Chinese, Dutch, English, German and
Spanish, we use the structured-skipgram (Ling
et al., 2015) embeddings. For other languages we
use Polyglot embeddings (Al-Rfou et al., 2013).

Optimization. Parameter optimization is per-
formed with the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2014) with β1 = β2 = 0.9. We choose an ini-
tial learning rate of η0 = 0.001. The learning
rate η is annealed by multiplying a fixed decay
rate ρ = 0.75 when parsing performance stops in-
creasing on validation sets. To reduce the effects
of “gradient exploding”, we use gradient clipping
of 5.0 (Pascanu et al., 2013).

Dropout Training. To mitigate overfitting, we
apply dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014; Ma et al.,
2017). For BLSTM, we use recurrent dropout (Gal
and Ghahramani, 2016) with a drop rate of 0.33
between hidden states and 0.33 between layers.
Following Dozat and Manning (2017), we also use
embedding dropout with a rate of 0.33 on all word,
character, and POS embeddings.

Hyper-Parameters. Some parameters are cho-
sen from those reported in Dozat and Manning
(2017). We use the same hyper-parameters across
the models on different treebanks and languages,
due to time constraints. The details of the chosen
hyper-parameters for all experiments are summa-
rized in Appendix A.

4 Experiments

4.1 Setup

We evaluate our STACKPTR parser mainly on
three treebanks: the English Penn Treebank
(PTB version 3.0) (Marcus et al., 1993), the
Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB version 5.1) (Xue
et al., 2002), and the German CoNLL 2009 cor-
pus (Hajič et al., 2009). We use the same experi-
mental settings as Kuncoro et al. (2016).

To make a thorough empirical comparison with
previous studies, we also evaluate our system on
treebanks from CoNLL shared task and the Uni-
versal Dependency (UD) Treebanks4. For the
CoNLL Treebanks, we use the English treebank
from CoNLL-2008 shared task (Surdeanu et al.,
2008) and all 13 treebanks from CoNLL-2006
shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). The ex-
perimental settings are the same as Ma and Hovy
(2015). For UD Treebanks, we select 12 lan-
guages. The details of the treebanks and experi-
mental settings are in § 4.5 and Appendix B.

Evaluation Metrics Parsing performance is
measured with five metrics: unlabeled attachment
score (UAS), labeled attachment score (LAS), un-
labeled complete match (UCM), labeled complete
match (LCM), and root accuracy (RA). Following
previous work (Kuncoro et al., 2016; Dozat and
Manning, 2017), we report results excluding punc-
tuations for Chinese and English. For each experi-

Figure 2: Parsing performance of different variations of our model on the test sets for three languages,
together with baseline BIAF. For each of our STACKPTR models, we perform decoding with beam size
equal to 1 and 10. The improvements of decoding with beam size 10 over 1 are presented by stacked
bars with light colors.

Baseline For fair comparison of the parsing per-
formance, we re-implemented the graph-based
Deep Biaffine (BIAF) parser (Dozat and Manning,
2017), which achieved state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of languages. Our re-implementation
adds character-level information using the same
LSTM-CNN encoder as our model (§ 3.2) to the
original BIAF model, which boosts its perfor-
mance on all languages.

4.2 Main Results

We first conduct experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our neural architecture by compar-
ing with the strong baseline BIAF. We compare
the performance of four variations of our model
with different decoder inputs — Org, +gpar, +sib
and Full — where the Org model utilizes only the
encoder hidden states of head words, while the
+gpar and +sib models augments the original one
with grandparent and sibling information, respec-
tively. The Full model includes all the three infor-
mation as inputs.

Figure 2 illustrates the performance (five met-
rics) of different variations of our STACKPTR
parser together with the results of baseline BIAF
re-implemented by us, on the test sets of the three

languages. On UAS and LAS, the Full variation
of STACKPTR with decoding beam size 10 outper-
forms BIAF on Chinese, and obtains competitive
performance on English and German. An interest-
ing observation is that the Full model achieves the
best accuracy on English and Chinese, while per-
forms slightly worse than +sib on German. This
shows that the importance of higher-order infor-
mation varies in languages. On LCM and UCM,
STACKPTR significantly outperforms BIAF on all
languages, showing the superiority of our parser
on complete sentence parsing. The results of our
parser on RA are slightly worse than BIAF. More
details of results are provided in Appendix C.

4.3 Comparison with Previous Work

Table 1 illustrates the UAS and LAS of the
four versions of our model (with decoding beam
size 10) on the three treebanks, together with
previous top-performing systems for comparison.
Note that the results of STACKPTR and our re-
implementation of BIAF are the average of 5 rep-
etitions instead of a single run. Our Full model
significantly outperforms all the transition-based
parsers on all three languages, and achieves bet-
ter results than most graph-based parsers. Our

re-implementation of BIAF obtains better perfor-
mance than the original one in Dozat and Man-
ning (2017), demonstrating the effectiveness of the
character-level information. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both UAS and
LAS on Chinese, and best UAS on English.
On German, the performance is competitive with
BIAF, and significantly better than other models.

4.4 Error Analysis

In this section, we characterize the errors made by
BIAF and STACKPTR by presenting a number of
experiments that relate parsing errors to a set of
linguistic and structural properties. For simplicity,

we follow McDonald and Nivre (2011) and report
labeled parsing metrics (either accuracy, precision,
or recall) for all experiments.

4.4.1 Length and Graph Factors
Following McDonald and Nivre (2011), we ana-
lyze parsing errors related to structural factors.

Sentence Length. Figure 3 (a) shows the ac-
curacy of both parsing models relative to sen-
tence lengths. Consistent with the analysis in Mc-
Donald and Nivre (2011), STACKPTR tends to
perform better on shorter sentences, which make
fewer parsing decisions, significantly reducing the
chance of error propagation.

Dependency Length. Figure 3 (b) measures
the precision and recall relative to dependency
lengths. While the graph-based BIAF parser
still performs better for longer dependency arcs
and transition-based STACKPTR parser does bet-
ter for shorter ones, the gap between the two sys-
tems is marginal, much smaller than that shown

Table 3: UAS and LAS on 14 treebanks from CoNLL shared tasks, together with several state-of-the-art
parsers. Bi-Att is the bi-directional attention based parser (Cheng et al., 2016), and NeuroMST is the
neural MST parser (Ma and Hovy, 2017). “Best Published” includes the most accurate parsers in term of
UAS among Koo et al. (2010), Martins et al. (2011), Martins et al. (2013), Lei et al. (2014), Zhang et al.
(2014), Zhang and McDonald (2014), Pitler and McDonald (2015), and Cheng et al. (2016).

in McDonald and Nivre (2011). One possible
reason is that, unlike traditional transition-based
parsers that scan the sentence from left to right,
STACKPTR processes in a top-down manner, thus
sometimes unnecessarily creating shorter depen-
dency arcs first.

Root Distance. Figure 3 (c) plots the precision
and recall of each system for arcs of varying dis-
tance to the root. Different from the observation
in McDonald and Nivre (2011), STACKPTR does
not show an obvious advantage on the precision
for arcs further away from the root. Furthermore,
the STACKPTR parser does not have the tendency
to over-predict root modifiers reported in McDon-
ald and Nivre (2011). This behavior can be ex-
plained using the same reasoning as above: the
fact that arcs further away from the root are usu-
ally constructed early in the parsing algorithm of
traditional transition-based parsers is not true for
the STACKPTR parser.

4.4.2 Effect of POS Embedding
The only prerequisite information that our pars-
ing model relies on is POS tags. With the goal of
achieving an end-to-end parser, we explore the ef-
fect of POS tags on parsing performance. We run
experiments on PTB using our STACKPTR parser
with gold-standard and predicted POS tags, and
without tags, respectively. STACKPTR in these ex-
periments is the Full model with beam=10.

Table 2 gives results of the parsers with differ-
ent versions of POS tags on the test data of PTB.

The parser with gold-standard POS tags signifi-
cantly outperforms the other two parsers, show-
ing that dependency parsers can still benefit from
accurate POS information. The parser with pre-
dicted (imperfect) POS tags, however, performs
even slightly worse than the parser without us-
ing POS tags. It illustrates that an end-to-end
parser that doesn’t rely on POS information can
obtain competitive (or even better) performance
than parsers using imperfect predicted POS tags,
even if the POS tagger is relative high accuracy
(accuracy > 97% in this experiment on PTB).

4.5 Experiments on Other Treebanks

4.5.1 CoNLL Treebanks

Table 3 summarizes the parsing results of our
model on the test sets of 14 treebanks from the
CoNLL shared task, along with the state-of-the-
art baselines. Along with BIAF, we also list the
performance of the bi-directional attention based
Parser (Bi-Att) (Cheng et al., 2016) and the neural
MST parser (NeuroMST) (Ma and Hovy, 2017)
for comparison. Our parser achieves state-of-the-
art performance on both UAS and LAS on eight
languages — Arabic, Czech, English, German,
Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish. On
Bulgarian and Dutch, our parser obtains the best
UAS. On other languages, the performance of our
parser is competitive with BIAF, and significantly
better than others. The only exception is Japanese,
on which NeuroMST obtains the best scores.

Table 4: UAS and LAS on both the development and test datasets of 12 treebanks from UD Treebanks,
together with BIAF for comparison.

4.5.2 UD Treebanks
For UD Treebanks, we select 12 languages — Bul-
garian, Catalan, Czech, Dutch, English, French,
German, Italian, Norwegian, Romanian, Russian
and Spanish. For all the languages, we adopt the
standard training/dev/test splits, and use the uni-
versal POS tags (Petrov et al., 2012) provided in
each treebank. The statistics of these corpora are
provided in Appendix B.

Table 4 summarizes the results of the
STACKPTR parser, along with BIAF for compari-
son, on both the development and test datasets for
each language. First, both BIAF and STACKPTR
parsers achieve relatively high parsing accuracies
on all the 12 languages — all with UAS are higher
than 90%. On nine languages — Catalan, Czech,
Dutch, English, French, German, Norwegian,
Russian and Spanish — STACKPTR outperforms
BIAF for both UAS and LAS. On Bulgarian,
STACKPTR achieves slightly better UAS while
LAS is slightly worse than BIAF. On Italian
and Romanian, BIAF obtains marginally better
parsing performance than STACKPTR.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed STACKPTR, a
transition-based neural network architecture, for
dependency parsing. Combining pointer networks
with an internal stack to track the status of the
top-down, depth-first search in the decoding pro-
cedure, the STACKPTR parser is able to capture
information from the whole sentence and all the
previously derived subtrees, removing the left-
to-right restriction in classical transition-based
parsers, while maintaining linear parsing steps,
w.r.t the length of the sentences. Experimental re-

sults on 29 treebanks show the effectiveness of our
parser across 20 languages, by achieving state-of-
the-art performance on 21 corpora.

There are several potential directions for future
work. First, we intend to consider how to conduct
experiments to improve the analysis of parsing er-
rors qualitatively and quantitatively. Another in-
teresting direction is to further improve our model
by exploring reinforcement learning approaches to
learn an optimal order for the children of head
words, instead of using a predefined fixed order.
