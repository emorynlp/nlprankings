Abstract

We introduce two ways to detect entail-
ment using distributional semantic repre-
sentations of phrases. Our first experiment
shows that the entailment relation between
adjective-noun constructions and their head
nouns (big cat |= cat), once represented as
semantic vector pairs, generalizes to lexical
entailment among nouns (dog |= animal).
Our second experiment shows that a classi-
fier fed semantic vector pairs can similarly
generalize the entailment relation among
quantifier phrases (many dogs|=some dogs)
to entailment involving unseen quantifiers
(all cats|=several cats). Moreover, nominal
and quantifier phrase entailment appears to
be cued by different distributional corre-
lates, as predicted by the type-based view
of entailment in formal semantics.

1 Introduction

Distributional semantics (DS) approximates lin-
guistic meaning with vectors summarizing the
contexts where expressions occur. The success
of DS in lexical semantics has validated the hy-
pothesis that semantically similar expressions oc-
cur in similar contexts (Landauer and Dumais,
1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996; Sahlgren, 2006;
Schütze, 1997; Turney and Pantel, 2010). For-
mal semantics (FS) represents linguistic mean-
ings as symbolic formulas and assemble them via
composition rules. FS has successfully modeled
quantification and captured inferential relations
between phrases and between sentences (Mon-
tague, 1970; Thomason, 1974; Heim and Kratzer,
1998). The strengths of DS and FS have been
complementary to date: On one hand, DS has in-
duced large-scale semantic representations from
corpora, but it has been largely limited to the

lexical domain. On the other hand, FS has pro-
vided sophisticated models of sentence meaning,
but it has been largely limited to hand-coded mod-
els that do not scale up to real-life challenges by
learning from data.

Given these complementary strengths, we nat-
urally ask if DS and FS can address each other’s
limitations. Two recent strands of research are
bringing DS closer to meeting core FS chal-
lenges. One strand attempts to model compo-
sitionality with DS methods, representing both
primitive and composed linguistic expressions
as distributional vectors (Baroni and Zamparelli,
2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Gue-
vara, 2010; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010). The
other strand attempts to reformulate FS’s notion
of logical inference in terms that DS can cap-
ture (Erk, 2009; Geffet and Dagan, 2005; Kotler-
man et al., 2010; Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan,
2010). In keeping with the lexical emphasis of
DS, this strand has focused on inference at the
word level, or lexical entailment, that is, discover-
ing from distributional vectors of hyponyms (dog)
that they entail their hypernyms (animal).

This paper brings these two strands of research
together by demonstrating two ways in which the
distributional vectors of composite expressions
bear on inference. Here we focus on phrasal vec-
tors harvested directly from the corpus rather than
obtained compositionally. In a first experiment,
we exploit the entailment properties of a class
of composite expressions, namely adjective-noun
constructions (ANs), to harvest training data for
an entailment recognizer. The recognizer is then
successfully applied to detect lexical entailment.
In short, since almost all ANs entail the noun they
contain (red car entails car), the distributional
vectors of AN-N pairs can train a classifier to de-
tect noun pairs that stand in the same relation (dog

23



entails animal). With almost no manual effort,
we achieve performance nearly identical with the
state-of-the-art balAPinc measure that Kotlerman
et al. (2010) crafted, which detects feature inclu-
sion between the two nouns’ occurrence contexts.

Our second experiment goes beyond lexical in-
ference. We look at phrases built from a quanti-
fying determiner1 and a noun (QNs) and use their
distributional vectors to recognize entailment re-
lations of the form many dogs |= some dogs, be-
tween two QNs sharing the same noun. It turns
out that a classifier trained on a set of Q1N |=Q2N
pairs can recognize entailment in pairs with a new
quantifier configuration. For example, we can
train on many dogs |= some dogs then correctly
predict all cats|=several cats. Interestingly, on the
QN entailment task, neither our classifier trained
on AN-N pairs nor the balAPinc method beat
baseline methods. This suggests that our success-
ful QN classifiers tap into vector properties be-
yond such relations as feature inclusion that those
methods for nominal entailment rely upon.

Together, our experiments show that corpus-
harvested DS representations of composite ex-
pressions such as ANs and QNs contain suffi-
cient information to capture and generalize their
inference patterns. This result brings DS closer
to the central concerns of FS. In particular, the
QN study is the first to our knowledge to show
that DS vectors capture semantic properties not
only of content words, but of an important class of
function words (quantifying determiners) deeply
studied in FS but of little interest until now in DS.

Besides these theoretical implications, our re-
sults are of practical import. First, our AN study
presents a novel, practical method for detect-
ing lexical entailment that reaches state-of-the-
art performance with little or no manual interven-
tion. Lexical entailment is in turn fundamental
for constructing ontologies and other lexical re-
sources (Buitelaar and Cimiano, 2008). Second,
our QN study demonstrates that phrasal entail-
ment can be automatically detected and thus paves
the way to apply DS to advanced NLP tasks such
as recognizing textual entailment (Dagan et al.,
2009).

1In the sequel we will simply refer to a “quantifying de-
terminer” as a “quantifier”.

2 Background

2.1 Distributional semantics above the word
level

DS models such as LSA (Landauer and Dumais,
1997) and HAL (Lund and Burgess, 1996) ap-
proximate the meaning of a word by a vector that
summarizes its distribution in a corpus, for exam-
ple by counting co-occurrences of the word with
other words. Since semantically similar words
tend to share similar contexts, DS has been very
successful in tasks that require quantifying se-
mantic similarity among words, such as synonym
detection and concept clustering (Turney and Pan-
tel, 2010).

Recently, there has been a flurry of interest
in DS to model meaning composition: How can
we derive the DS representation of a composite
phrase from that of its constituents? Although the
general focus in the area is to perform algebraic
operations on word semantic vectors (Mitchell
and Lapata, 2010), some researchers have also di-
rectly examined the corpus contexts of phrases.
For example, Baldwin et al. (2003) studied vec-
tor extraction for phrases because they were inter-
ested in the decomposability of multiword expres-
sions. Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Gue-
vara (2010) look at corpus-harvested phrase vec-
tors to learn composition functions that should de-
rive such composite vectors automatically. Ba-
roni and Zamparelli, in particular, showed qual-
itatively that directly corpus-harvested vectors for
AN constructions are meaningful; for example,
the vector of young husband has nearest neigh-
bors small son, small daughter and mistress. Fol-
lowing up on this approach, we show here quanti-
tatively that corpus-harvested AN vectors are also
useful for detecting entailment. We find moreover
distributional vectors informative and useful not
only for phrases made of content words (such as
ANs) but also for phrases containing functional
elements, namely quantifying determiners.

2.2 Entailment from formal to distributional
semantics

Entailment in FS To characterize the condi-
tions under which a sentence is true, FS begins
with the lexical meanings of the words in the sen-
tence and builds up the meanings of larger and
larger phrases until it arrives at the meaning of the
whole sentence. The meanings throughout this

24



compositional process inhabit a variety of seman-
tic domains, depending on the syntactic category
of the expressions: typically, a sentence denotes a
truth value (true or false) or truth conditions,
a noun such as cat denotes a set of entities, and a
quantifier phrase (QP) such as all cats denotes a
set of sets of entities.

The entailment relation (|=) is a core notion of
logic: it holds between one or more sentences and
a sentence such that it cannot be that the former
(antecedent) are true and the latter (consequent)
is false. FS extends this notion from formal-logic
sentences to natural-language expressions. By as-
signing meanings to parts of a sentence, FS allows
defining entailment not only among sentences but
also among words and phrases. Each semantic
domain A has its own entailment relation |=A.
The entailment relation |=S among sentences is
the logical notion just described, whereas the en-
tailment relations |=N and |=QP among nouns
and quantifier phrases are the inclusion relations
among sets of entities and sets of sets of entities
respectively. Our results in Section 5 show that
DS needs to treat |=N and |=QP differently as well.

Empirical, corpus-based perspectives on en-
tailment Until recently, the corpus-based re-
search tradition has studied entailment mostly at
the word level, with applied goals such as clas-
sifying lexical relations and building taxonomic
WordNet-like resources automatically. The most
popular approach, first adopted by Hearst (1992),
extracts lexical relations from patterns in large
corpora. For instance, from the pattern N1 such
as N2 one learns that N2 |=N1 (from insects such
as beetles, derive beetles |= insects). Several stud-
ies have refined and extended this approach (Pan-
tel and Ravichandran, 2004; Snow et al., 2005;
Snow et al., 2006; Turney, 2008).

While empirically very successful, the pattern-
based method is mostly limited to single content
words (or frequent content-word phrases). We are
interested in entailment between phrases, where it
is not obvious how to use lexico-syntactic patterns
and cope with data sparsity. For instance, it seems
hard to find a pattern that frequently connects one
QP to another it entails, as in all beetles PATTERN
many beetles. Hence, we aim to find a more gen-
eral method and investigate whether DS vectors
(whether corpus-harvested or compositionally de-
rived) encode the information needed to account

for phrasal entailment in a way that can be cap-
tured and generalized to unseen phrase pairs.

Rather recently, the study of sentential entail-
ment has taken an empirical turn, thanks to the de-
velopment of benchmarks for entailment systems.
The FS definition of entailment has been modified
by taking common sense into account. Instead of
a relation from the truth of the consequent to the
truth of the antecedent in any circumstance, the
applied view looks at entailment in terms of plau-
sibility: φ |= ψ if a human who reads (and trusts)
φ would most likely infer that ψ is also true. En-
tailment systems have been compared under this
new perspective in various evaluation campaigns,
the best known being the Recognizing Textual En-
tailment (RTE) initiative (Dagan et al., 2009).

Most RTE systems are based on advanced NLP
components, machine learning techniques, and/or
syntactic transformations (Zanzotto et al., 2007;
Kouleykov and Magnini, 2005). A few systems
exploit deep FS analysis (Bos and Markert, 2006;
Chambers et al., 2007). In particular, the FS re-
sults about QP properties that affect entailment
have been exploited by Chambers et al, who com-
plement a core broad-coverage system with a Nat-
ural Logic module to trade lower recall for higher
precision. For instance, they exploit the mono-
tonicity properties of no that cause the follow-
ing reversal in entailment direction: some bee-
tles |= some insects but no insects |= no beetles.

To investigate entailment step by step, we ad-
dress here a much simpler and clearer type of
entailment than the more complex notion taken
up by the RTE community. While RTE is out-
side our present scope, we do focus on QP entail-
ment as Natural Logic does. However, our eval-
uation differs from Chambers et al.’s, since we
rely on general-purpose DS vectors as our only
resource, and we look at phrase pairs with differ-
ent quantifiers but the same noun. For instance,
we aim to predict that all beetles |= many beetles
but few beetles 6|=all beetles. QPs, of course, have
many well-known semantic properties besides en-
tailment; we leave their analysis to future study.

Entailment in DS Erk (2009) suggests that it
may not be possible to induce lexical entailment
directly from a vector space representation, but it
is possible to encode the relation in this space af-
ter it has been derived through other means. On
the other hand, recent studies (Geffet and Dagan,

25



2005; Kotlerman et al., 2010; Weeds et al., 2004)
have pursued the intuition that entailment is the
asymmetric ability of one term to “substitute” for
another. For example, baseball contexts are also
sport contexts but not vice versa, hence baseball
is “narrower” than sport and baseball |=sport. On
this view, entailment between vectors corresponds
to inclusion of contexts or features, and can be
captured by asymmetric measures of distribution
similarity. In particular, Kotlerman et al. (2010)
carefully crafted the balAPinc measure (see Sec-
tion 3.5 below). We adopt this measure because
it has been shown to outperform others in several
tasks that require lexical entailment information.

Like Kotlerman et al., we want to capture the
entailment relation between vectors of features.
However, we are interested in entailment not only
between words but also between phrases, and we
ask whether the DS view of entailment as fea-
ture inclusion, which captures entailment between
nouns, also captures entailment between QPs. To
this end, we complement balAPinc with a more
flexible supervised classifier.

3 Data and methods

3.1 Semantic space

We construct distributional semantic vectors from
the 2.83-billion-token concatenation of the British
National Corpus (http://www.natcorp.
ox.ac.uk/), WackyPedia and ukWaC (http:
//wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/). We tok-
enize and POS-tag this corpus, then lemmatize
it with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995) to merge sin-
gular and plural instances of words and phrases
(some dogs is mapped to some dog).

We process the corpus in two steps to compute
semantic vectors representing our phrases of in-
terest. We use phrases of interest as a general
term to refer to both multiword phrases and sin-
gle words, and more precisely to: those AN and
QN sequences that are in the data sets (see next
subsections), the adjectives, quantifiers and nouns
contained in those sequences, and the most fre-
quent (9.8K) nouns and (8.1K) adjectives in the
corpus. The first step is to count the content
words (more precisely, the most frequent 9.8K
nouns, 8.1K adjectives, and 9.6K verbs in the cor-
pus) that occur in the same sentence as phrases
of interest. In the second step, following standard
practice, the co-occurrence counts are converted

into pointwise mutual information (PMI) scores
(Church and Hanks, 1990). The result of this step
is a sparse matrix (with both positive and negative
entries) with 48K rows (one per phrase of interest)
and 27K columns (one per content word).

3.2 The AN |= N data set
To characterize entailment between nouns using
their semantic vectors, we need data exemplifying
which noun entails which. This section introduces
one cheap way to collect such a training data set
exploiting semantic vectors for composed expres-
sions, namely AN sequences. We rely on the lin-
guistic fact that ANs share a syntactic category
and semantic type with plain common nouns (big
cat shares syntactic category and semantic type
with cat). Furthermore, most adjectives are re-
strictive in the sense that, for every noun N, the
AN sequence entails the N alone (every big cat
is a cat). From a distributional point of view, the
vector for an N should by construction include the
information in the vector for an AN, given that the
contexts where the AN occurs are a subset of the
contexts where the N occurs (cat occurs in all the
contexts where big cat occurs). This ideal inclu-
sion suggests that the DS notion of lexical entail-
ment as feature inclusion (see Section 2.2 above)
should be reflected in the AN |= N pattern.

Because most ANs entail their head Ns, we can
create positive examples of AN |= N without any
manual inspection of the corpus: simply pair up
the semantic vectors of ANs and Ns. Furthermore,
because an AN usually does not entail another N,
we can create negative examples (AN1 6|= N2) just
by randomly permuting the Ns. Of course, such
unsupervised data would be slightly noisy, espe-
cially because some of the most frequent adjec-
tives are not restrictive.

To collect cleaner data and to be sure that we
are really examining the phenomenon of entail-
ment, we took a mere few moments of man-
ual effort to select the 256 restrictive adjectives
from the most frequent 300 adjectives in the cor-
pus. We then took the Cartesian product of these
256 adjectives with the 200 concrete nouns in the
BLESS data set (Baroni and Lenci, 2011). Those
nouns were chosen to avoid highly polysemous
words. From the Cartesian product, we obtain a
total of 1246 AN sequences, such as big cat, that
occur more than 100 times in the corpus. These
AN sequences encompass 190 of the 256 adjec-

26



tives and 128 of the 200 nouns.
The process results in 1246 positive instances

of AN |= N entailment, which we use as training
data. To create a comparable amount of negative
data, we randomly permuted the nouns in the pos-
itive instances to obtain pairs of AN1 6|= N2 (e.g.,
big cat 6|=dog). We manually double-checked that
all positive and negative examples are correctly
classified (2 of 1246 negative instances were re-
moved, leaving 1244 negative training examples).

3.3 The lexical entailment N1 |= N2 data set
For testing data, we first listed all WordNet nouns
in our corpus, then extracted hyponym-hypernym
chains linking the first synsets of these nouns. For
example, pope is found to entail leader because
WordNet contains the chain pope → spiritual
leader → leader. Eliminating the 20 hypernyms
with more than 180 hyponyms (mostly very ab-
stract nouns such as entity, object, and quality)
yields 9734 hyponym-hypernym pairs, encom-
passing 6402 nouns. Manually double-checking
these pairs leaves us with 1385 positive instances
of N1 |= N2 entailment.

We created the negative instances of again 1385
pairs by inverting 33% of the positive instances
(from pope|=leader to leader 6|=pope), and by ran-
domly shuffling the words across the positive in-
stances. We also manually double-checked these
pairs to make sure that they are not hyponym-
hypernym pairs.

3.4 The Q1N |= Q2N data set
We study 12 quantifiers: all, both, each, either,
every, few, many, most, much, no, several, some.
We took the Cartesian product of these quantifiers
with the 6402 WordNet nouns described in Sec-
tion 3.3. From this Cartesian product, we obtain
a total of 28926 QN sequences, such as every cat,
that occur at least 100 times in the corpus. These
are our QN phrases of interest to which the proce-
dure in Section 3.1 assigns a semantic vector.

Also, from the set of quantifier pairs (Q1,Q2)
where Q1 6= Q2, we identified 13 clear cases
where Q1 |=Q2 and 17 clear cases where Q1 6|=Q2.
These 30 cases are listed in the first column of
Table 1. For each of these 30 quantifier pairs
(Q1,Q2), we enumerate those WordNet nouns N
such that semantic vectors are available for both
Q1N and Q2N (that is, both sequences occur in
at least 100 times). Each such noun then gives

that each quantifier pair gives rise to in this way is

there, we have a total of 7537 positive instances

3.5 Classification methods

We consider two methods to classify candidate
pairs as entailing or non-entailing, the balAPinc
measure of Kotlerman et al. (2010) and a standard
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

27



balAPinc As discussed in Section 2.2, balAP-
inc is optimized to capture a relation of feature
inclusion between the narrower (entailing) and
broader (entailed) terms, while capturing other in-
tuitions about the relative relevance of features.
balAPinc averages two terms, APinc and LIN.
APinc is given by:

APinc(u |= v) =
∑|Fu|

r=1

(
P (r) · rel′(fr)

)
|Fu|

APinc is a version of the Average Precision
measure from Information Retrieval tailored to
lexical inclusion. Given vectors Fu and Fv rep-
resenting the dimensions with positive PMI val-
ues in the semantic vectors of the candidate pair
u |= v, the idea is that we want the features (that
is, vector dimensions) that have larger values in
Fu to also have large values in Fv (the opposite
does not matter because it is u that should be in-
cluded in v, not vice versa). The Fu features are
ranked according to their PMI value so that fr
is the feature in Fu with rank r, i.e., r-th high-
est PMI. Then the sum of the product of the two
terms P (r) and rel′(fr) across the features in Fu
is computed. The first term is the precision at r,
which is higher when highly ranked u features are
present in Fv as well. The relevance term rel′(fr)
is higher when the feature fr in Fu also appears
in Fv with a high rank. (See Kotlerman et al. for
how P (r) and rel′(fr) are computed.) The result-
ing score is normalized by dividing by the entail-
ing vector size |Fu| (in accordance with the idea
that having more v features should not hurt be-
cause the u features should be included in the v
features, not vice versa).

To balance the potentially excessive asymmetry
of APinc towards the features of the antecedent,
Kotlerman et al. average it with LIN, the widely
used symmetric measure of distributional similar-
ity proposed by Lin (1998):

LIN(u, v) =

∑
f∈Fu∩Fv [wu(f) + wv(f)]∑

f∈Fu wu(f) +
∑

f∈Fv wv(f)

LIN essentially measures feature vector overlap.
The positive PMI values wu(f) and wv(f) of a
feature f in Fu and Fv are summed across those
features that are positive in both vectors, normal-
izing by the cumulative positive PMI mass in both
vectors. Finally, balAPinc is the geometric aver-
age of APinc and LIN:

balAPinc(u|=v) =
√

APinc(u |= v) · LIN(u, v)

To adapt balAPinc to recognize entailment, we
must select a threshold t above which we classify
a pair as entailing. In the experiments below, we
explore two approaches. In balAPincupper, we op-
timize the threshold directly on the test data, by
setting t to maximize the F-measure on the test
set. This gives us an upper bound on how well bal-
APinc could perform on the test set (but note that
optimizing F does not necessarily translate into a
good accuracy performance, as clearly illustrated
by Table 3 below). In balAPincAN |= N, we use the
AN |= N data set as training data and pick the t
that maximizes F on this training set.

We use the balAPinc measure as a refer-
ence point because, on the evidence provided by
Kotlerman et al., it is the state of the art in various
tasks related to lexical entailment. We recognize
however that it is somewhat complex and specifi-
cally tuned to capturing the relation of feature in-
clusion. Consequently, we also experiment with
a more flexible classifier, which can detect other
systematic properties of vectors in an entailment
relation. We present this classifier next.

SVM Support vector machines are widely used
high-performance discriminative classifiers that
find the hyperplane providing the best separation
between negative and positive instances (Cristian-
ini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). Our SVM classifiers
are trained and tested using Weka 3 and LIBSVM
2.8 (Chang and Lin, 2011). We use the default
polynomial kernel ((u ·v/600)3) with � (tolerance
of termination criterion) set to 1.6. This value was
tuned on the AN |=N data set, which we never use
for testing. In the same initial tuning experiments
on the AN |=N data set, SVM outperformed deci-
sion trees, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors.

We feed each potential entailment pair to SVM
by concatenating the two vectors representing the
antecedent and consequent expressions.2 How-
ever, for efficiency and to mitigate data sparse-
ness, we reduce the dimensionality of the seman-
tic vectors to 300 columns using Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) before feeding them to the
classifier.3 Because the SVD-reduced semantic

2We have tried also to represent a pair by subtracting and
by dividing the two vectors. The concatenation operation
gave more successful results.

3To keep a manageable parameter space, we picked 300
columns without tuning. This is the best value reported in
many earlier studies, including classic LSA. Since SVD
sometimes improves the semantic space (Landauer and Du-

28



vectors occupy a 300-dimensional space, the en-
tailment pairs occupy a 600-dimensional space.

An SVM with a polynomial kernel takes into
account not only individual input features but also
their interactions (Manning et al., 2008, chapter
15). Thus, our classifier can capture not just prop-
erties of individual dimensions of the antecedent
and consequent pairs, but also properties of their
combinations (e.g., the product of the first dimen-
sions of the antecedent and the consequent). We
conjecture that this property of SVMs is funda-
mental to their success at detecting entailment,
where relations between the antecedent and the
consequent should matter more than their inde-
pendent characteristics.

4 Predicting lexical entailment from
AN |= N evidence

Since the contexts of AN must be a subset of the
contexts of N, semantic vectors harvested from
AN phrases and their head Ns are by construc-
tion in an inclusion relation. The first experiment
shows that these vectors constitute excellent train-
ing data to discover entailment between nouns.
This suggests that the vector pairs representing
entailment between nouns are also in an inclusion
relation, supporting the conjectures of Kotlerman
et al. (2010) and others.

Table 2 reports the results we obtained with
balAPincupper, balAPincAN |= N (Section 3.5) and
SVMAN |= N (the SVM classifier trained on the
AN |= N data). As an upper bound for meth-
ods that generalize from AN |= N, we also re-
port the performance of SVM trained with 10-fold
cross-validation on the N1 |= N2 data themselves
(SVMupper). Finally, we tried two baseline classi-
fiers. The first baseline (fq(N1)< fq(N2)) guesses
entailment if the first word is less frequent than
the second. The second (cos(N1, N2)) applies a
threshold (determined on the test set) to the co-
sine similarity of the pair. The results of these
baselines shown in Table 2 use SVD; those with-
out SVD are similar. Both baselines outperformed
more trivial methods such as random guessing or
fixed response, but they performed significantly
worse than SVM and balAPinc.

Both methods that generalize entailment from
AN |= N to N1 |= N2 perform well, with 70%

accuracy on the test set, which is balanced be-
tween positive and negative instances. Interest-
ingly, the balAPinc decision thresholds tuned on
the AN |= N set and on the test data are very
close (0.26 vs. 0.24), resulting in very similar per-
formance for balAPincAN |= N and balAPincupper.
This suggests that the relation captured by bal-
APinc on the phrasal entailment training data is
indeed the same that the measure captures when
applied to lexical entailment data.

The success of this first experiment shows that
the entailment relation present in the distribu-
tional representation of AN phrases and their
head Ns transfers to lexical entailment (entailment
among Ns). Most importantly, this result demon-
strates that the semantic vectors of composite ex-
pressions (such as ANs) are useful for lexical en-
tailment. Moreover, the result is in accordance
with the view of FS, that ANs and Ns have the
same semantic type, and thus they enter entail-
ment relations of the same kind. Finally, the hy-
pothesis that entailment among nouns is reflected
by distributional inclusion among their semantic
vectors (Kotlerman et al., 2010) is supported both
by the successful generalization of the SVM clas-
sifier trained on AN |= N pairs and by the good
performance of the balAPinc measure.

5 Generalizing QN entailment

The second study is somewhat more ambitious,
as it aims to capture and generalize the entailment
relation between QPs (of shape QN) using only
the corpus-harvested semantic vectors represent-
ing these phrases as evidence. We are thus first
and foremost interested in testing whether these
vectors encode information that can help a power-

ful classifier, such as SVM, to detect entailment.
To abstract away from lexical or other effects

linked to a specific quantifier, we consider two
challenging training and testing regimes. In the
first (SVMpair-out), we hold out one quantifier pair
as testing data and use the other 29 pairs in Table 1
as training data. Thus, for example, the classifier
must discover all dogs |= some dogs without see-
ing any all N |= some N instance in the training
data. In the second (SVMquantifier-out), we hold out
one of the 12 quantifiers as testing data (that is,
hold out every pair involving a certain quantifier)
and use the rest as training data. For example,
the quantifier must guess all dogs |= some dogs
without ever seeing all in the training data. We
expect the second training regime to be more dif-
ficult, not just because there is less training data,
but also because the trained classifier is tested on
a quantifier that it has never encountered within
any training QN sequence.4

Table 3 reports the results for SVMpair-out and
SVMquantifier-out, as well as for the methods we
tried in the lexical entailment experiments. (As
in the first study, the frequency- and cosine-based

4In our initial experiments, we added negative entail-
ment instances by blindly permuting the nouns, under the
assumption that Q1N1 typically does not entail Q2N2 when
Q1 6= Q2 and N1 6= N2. These additional instances turned
out to be much easier to classify: adding an equal proportion
of them to the training data and testing data, such that the
number of instances where N1 = N2 and where N1 6= N2
is equal, reduced every error rate roughly by half. The re-
ported results do not involve these additional instances.

baselines are only slightly better overall than more
trivial baselines.) We consider moreover an alter-
native approach that ignores the noun altogether
and uses vectors for the quantifiers only (e.g., the
decision about all dogs |=some dogs considers the
corpus-derived all and some vectors only). The
models resulting from this Q-only strategy are
marked with the superscript Q in the table.

The results confirm clearly that semantic vec-
tors for QNs contain enough information to allow
a classifier to detect entailment: SVMquantifier-out
performs as well as the lexical entailment classi-
fiers of our first study, and SVMpair-out does even
better. This success is especially impressive given
our challenging training and testing regimes.

In contrast to the first study, now SVMAN |= N,
the classifier trained on the AN |= N data set,
and balAPinc perform no better than the base-
lines. (Here balAPincupper and balAPincAN |= N
pick very different thresholds: the first settling
on a very low t = 0.01, whereas for the sec-
ond t = 0.26.) As predicted by FS (see Section
2.2 above), noun-level entailment does not gen-
eralize to quantifier phrase entailment, since the
two structures have different semantic types, cor-
responding to different kinds of entailment rela-
tions. Moreover, the failure of balAPinc suggests
that, whatever evidence the SVMs rely upon, it is
not simple feature inclusion.

Interestingly, even the Q vectors alone encode
enough information to capture entailment above
chance. Still, the huge drop in performance from
SVMQpair-out to SVM

Q
quantifier-out suggests that the Q-

only method learned ad-hoc properties that do not
generalize (e.g., “all entails every Q2”).

Tables 1 and 4 break down the SVM results by
(pairs of) quantifiers. We highlight the remark-
able dichotomy in Table 4 between the good per-
formance on the universal-like quantifiers (each,
every, all, much) and the poor performance on the
existential-like ones (some, no, both, either).

In sum, the QN experiments show that seman-
tic vectors contain enough information to detect
a logical relation such as entailment not only be-
tween words, but also between phrases contain-
ing quantifiers that determine their entailment re-
lation. While a flexible classifier such as SVM
performs this task well, neither measuring fea-
ture inclusion nor generalizing nominal entail-
ment works. SVMs are evidently tapping into
other properties of the vectors.

6 Conclusion

Our main results are as follows.

1. Corpus-harvested semantic vectors repre-
senting adjective-noun constructions and
their heads encode a relation of entailment
that can be exploited to train a classifier
to detect lexical entailment. In particular,
a relation of feature inclusion between the
narrower antecedent and broader consequent
terms captures both AN |= N and N1 |= N2
entailment.

2. The semantic vectors of quantifier-noun con-
structions also encode information sufficient
to learn an entailment relation that general-
izes to QNs containing quantifiers that were
not seen during training.

3. Neither the entailment information encoded
in AN |= N vectors nor the balAPinc mea-
sure generalizes well to entailment detection
in QNs. This result suggests that QN vectors
encode a different kind of entailment, as also
suggested by type distinctions in Formal Se-
mantics.

In future work, we want first of all to conduct
an analysis of the features in the Q1N |=Q2N vec-
tors that are crucially exploited by our success-
ful entailment recognizers, in order to understand
which characteristics of entailment are encoded in
these vectors.

Very importantly, instead of extracting vectors
representing phrases directly from the corpus, we
intend to derive them by compositional operations
proposed in the literature (see Section 2.1 above).
We will look for composition methods producing
vector representations of composite expressions
that are as good as (or better than) vectors directly
extracted from the corpus at encoding entailment.

Finally, we would like to evaluate our entail-
ment detection strategies for larger phrases and
sentences, possibly containing multiple quanti-
fiers, and eventually embed them as core compo-
nents of an RTE system.
