Abstract

Recent work has developed supervised meth-
ods for detecting deceptive opinion spam—
fake reviews written to sound authentic and
deliberately mislead readers. And whereas
past work has focused on identifying individ-
ual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify
offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake re-
views. We introduce a semi-supervised man-
ifold ranking algorithm for this task, which
relies on a small set of labeled individual re-
views for training. Then, in the absence of
gold standard labels (at an offering level),
we introduce a novel evaluation procedure
that ranks artificial instances of real offer-
ings, where each artificial offering contains a
known number of injected deceptive reviews.
Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel re-
views show that the proposed method outper-
forms state-of-art learning baselines.

1 Introduction

Consumers increasingly rely on user-generated
online reviews when making purchase deci-
sions (Cone, 2011; Ipsos, 2012). Unfortunately,
the ease of posting content to the Web, potentially
anonymously, combined with the public’s trust and
growing reliance on opinions and other information
found online, create opportunities and incentives for
unscrupulous businesses to post deceptive opinion
spam—fraudulent or fictitious reviews that are
deliberately written to sound authentic, in order to
deceive the reader (Ott et al, 2011).

Unlike other kinds of spam, such as
Web (Martinez-Romo and Araujo, 2009; Castillo
et al, 2006) and e-mail spam (Chirita et al, 2005),
recent work has found that deceptive opinion spam
is neither easily ignored nor easily identified by

human readers (Ott et al, 2011). Accordingly, there
is growing interest in developing automatic, usually
learning-based, methods to help users identify
deceptive opinion spam (see Section 2). Even
in fully-supervised settings, however, automatic
methods are imperfect at identifying individual
deceptive reviews, and erroneously labeling genuine
reviews as deceptive may frustrate and alienate
honest reviewers.

An alternative approach, not yet considered in
previous work, is to instead identify those prod-
uct or service offerings where fake reviews appear
with high probability. For example, a hotel manager
may post fake positive reviews to promote their own
hotel, or fake negative reviews to demote a com-
petitor’s hotel. In both cases, rather than identify-
ing these deceptive reviews individually, it may be
preferable to identify the manipulated offering (i.e.,
the hotel) so that review portal operators, such as
TripAdvisor or Yelp, can further investigate the sit-
uation without alienating users.1

Accordingly, this paper addresses the novel task
of identifying manipulated offerings, which we
frame as a ranking problem, where the goal is to rank
offerings by the proportion of their reviews that are
believed to be deceptive. We propose a novel three-
layer graph model, based on manifold ranking (Zhou
et al, 2003a; 2003b), to jointly model deceptive lan-
guage at the offering-, review- and term-level. In
particular, rather than treating reviews within the
same offering as independent units, there is a rein-
forcing relationship between offerings and reviews.

1Manipulating online reviews may also have legal conse-
quences. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
has updated their guidelines on the use of endorsements and
testimonials in advertising to suggest that posting deceptive re-
views may be unlawful in the United States (FTC, 2009).

Figure 1: Mutual Reinforcement Graph Model for Hotel
Ranking using the Manifold-Ranking Method

Our manifold ranking approach is semi-
supervised in that it requires no supervisory
information at the offering level; rather, it requires
only a small amount of labeled data at a review
level. Intuitively, and as depicted in Figure 1 for
hotel offerings, we represent hotels, reviews and
terms as nodes in a graph, where each hotel is
connected to its reviews, and each review, in turn, is
connected to the terms used within it. The influence
of labeled data is propagated along the graph to
unlabeled data, such that a hotel is considered more
deceptive if it is heavily linked with other deceptive
reviews, and a review, in turn, is more deceptive if it
is generated by a deceptive hotel.

The success of our semi-supervised approach fur-
ther depends on the ability to learn patterns of truth-
ful and deceptive reviews that generalize across re-
views of different offerings. This is challenging, be-
cause reviews often contain offering-specific vocab-
ulary. For example, reviews of hotels in Los Angeles
are more likely to include keywords such as “beach”,
“sea”, “sunshine” or “LA”, while reviews of Juneau
hotels may contain “glacier”, “Juneau”, “bear” or
“aurora borealis.” A hotel review might also men-
tion the hotel’s restaurant or bar by name.

Unfortunately, it is unclear how important (or
detrimental) offering-specific features are when de-
ciding whether a review is fake. Accordingly, we
propose a dimensionality-reduction approach, based
on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al,
2003), to obtain a vector representation of reviews
for the ranking algorithm that generalizes across re-
views of different offerings. Specifically, we train

an LDA-based topic model to view each review as a
mixture of aspect-, city-, hotel- and review-specific
topics (see Section 6). We then reduce the dimen-
sionality of our data (i.e., labeled and unlabeled re-
views) by replacing each review term vector with a
vector that corresponds to its term distribution over
just its aspect-specific topics, i.e., excluding city-,
hotel- and review-specific topics. We find that, com-
pared to models trained either on the full vocabulary,
or trained on standard LDA document-topic vectors,
this representation allows our models to generalize
better across reviews of different offerings.

We evaluate our approach on the task of identi-
fying (ranking) manipulated hotels. In particular, in
the absence of gold standard offering-level labels,
we introduce a novel evaluation procedure for this
task, in which we rank numerous versions of each
hotel, where each hotel version contains a differ-
ent number of injected, known deceptive reviews.
Thus, we expect hotel versions with larger propor-
tions of deceptive reviews to be ranked higher than
those with smaller proportions.

For labeled training data, we use the Ott et
al. (2011) dataset of 800 positive (5-star) reviews of
20 Chicago hotels (400 deceptive and 400 truthful).
For evaluation, we construct a new FOUR-CITIES
dataset, containing 40 deceptive and 40 truthful re-
views for each of eight hotels in four different cities
(640 reviews total), following the procedure out-
lined in Ott et al. (2011). We find that our manifold
ranking approach outperforms several state-of-the-
art learning baselines on this task, including trans-
ductive Support Vector Regression. We addition-
ally apply our approach to a large-scale collection
of real-world reviews from TripAdvisor and explore
the resulting ranking.

In the sections below, we discuss related work
(Section 2) and describe the datasets used in this
work (Section 3), the dimensionality-reduction ap-
proach for representing reviews (Section 4), and the
semi-supervised manifold ranking approach (Sec-
tion 5). We then evaluate the methods quantitatively
(Sections 6 and 7) and qualitatively (Section 8).

2 Related Work

A number of recent approaches have focused on
identifying individual fake reviews or users who post

1934



fake reviews. For example, Jindal and Liu (2008)
train machine learning classifiers to identify dupli-
cate (or near duplicate) reviews. Yoo and Gretzel
(2009) gathered 40 truthful and 42 deceptive hotel
reviews and manually compare the psychologically
relevant linguistic differences between them. Lim et
al. (2010) propose an approach based on abnormal
user behavior to predict spam users, without using
any textual features. Ott et al. (2011) solicit decep-
tive reviews from workers on Amazon Mechanical
Turk, and built a dataset containing 400 deceptive
and 400 truthful reviews, which they use to train
and evaluate supervised SVM classifiers. Ott et al.
(2012) expand upon this work to estimate preva-
lences of deception in a review community. Mukher-
jee et al. (2012) study spam produced by groups of
fake reviewers. Li et al. (2013) use topic models
to detect differences between deceptive and truthful
topic-word distributions. In contrast, in this work we
aim to identify fake reviews at an offering level.2

LDA Topic Models. LDA topic models (Blei et
al, 2003) have been employed for many NLP tasks
in recent years. Here, we build on earlier work
that uses topic models to (a) separate background
information from information discussing the vari-
ous “aspects” of products (e.g., Chemudugunta et
al. (2007)) and (b) identify different levels of infor-
mation (e.g., user-specific, location-specific, time-
specific) (Ramage et al., 2009).

Manifold Ranking Algorithm. The manifold-
ranking method (Zhou et al, 2003a; Zhou et al,
2003b) is a mutual reinforcement ranking approach
initially proposed to rank data points along their un-
derlying manifold structure. It has been widely used
in many different ranking applications, such as sum-
marization (Wan et al, 2007; Wan and Yang, 2007).

3 Dataset

In this paper, we train all of our models using the
CHICAGO dataset of Ott et al (2011), which contains
20 deceptive and 20 truthful reviews from each of 20
Chicago hotels (800 reviews total). This dataset is

2Approaches for identifying individual fake reviews may be
applied to our task, for example, by averaging the review-level
predictions for an offering. This averaging approach is one of
our baselines in Section 7.

unique in that it contains known (gold standard) de-
ceptive reviews, solicited through Amazon Mechan-
ical Turk, and is publicly-available.3

Unfortunately, the CHICAGO dataset is limited,
both in size (800 reviews) and scope, in that it only
contains reviews of hotels in one city: Chicago.
Accordingly, in order to perform a more realistic
evaluation for our task, we construct a new dataset,
FOUR-CITIES, that contains 40 deceptive and 40
truthful reviews from each of eight hotels in four dif-
ferent cities (640 reviews total).

We build the FOUR-CITIES dataset using the same
procedure as Ott et al (2011), by creating and di-
viding 320 Mechanical Turk jobs, called Human-
Intelligence Tasks (HITs), evenly across eight of the
most popular hotels in our four chosen cities (see Ta-
ble 1). Each HIT presents a worker with the name of
a hotel and a link to the hotel’s website. Workers are
asked to imagine that they work for the marketing
department of the hotel and that their boss has asked
them to write a fake positive review, as if they were
a customer, to be posted on a travel review website.
Each worker is allowed to submit a single review,
and is paid $1 for an acceptable submission.

Finally, we augment our deceptive FOUR-CITIES
reviews with a matching set of truthful reviews from
TripAdvisor by randomly sampling 40 positive (5-
star) reviews for each of the eight chosen hotels.
While we cannot know for sure that the sampled re-
views are truthful, previous work has suggested that
rates of deception among popular hotels is likely to
be low (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Lim et al, 2010).

4 Topic Models for Dimensionality
Reduction

As mentioned in the introduction, we want to learn
patterns of truthful and deceptive reviews that apply

across hotels in different locations. This is challeng-
ing, however, because hotel reviews often contain
specific information about the hotel or city, and it
is unclear whether these features will generalize to
reviews of other hotels.

We therefore investigate an LDA-based
dimensionality-reduction approach (RLDA) to
derive effective vector representations of reviews.
Specifically, we model each document as a bag of
words, generated from a mixture of: (a) “aspect”
topics (that discuss various dimensions of the
offering); (b) city-specific topics; (c) hotel-specific
topics; (d) review-specific topics;4 and (e) a back-
ground topic. We use this model to reduce the
dimensionality of the review representation in our
training and test sets, by replacing each review’s
term vector with a vector corresponding to the
distribution over only the aspect-based topics, i.e.,
we exclude city, hotel and review-specific topics, as
well as the background topic.

Below we present specific details of our model
(Sections 4.1 and 4.2). The effectiveness of our
dimensionality-reduction approach will be directly
evaluated in Section 6, by comparing the perfor-
mance of various classifiers trained either on the full
vocabulary, or on our reduced feature representation.

4.1 RLDA Model Details

The plate diagram and generative story for our
model are given in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.
Our model has a similar general structure to stan-
dard LDA, but with additional machinery to handle
different levels of information. In particular, in or-
der to model K aspects in a collection of R reviews,

• Draw φB ∼ Dir(λ)
• For each aspect z = 1, 2, ...,K: draw φz ∼ Dir(λ)
• For each city c = 1, 2, ..., C: draw φc ∼ Dir(λ)
• For each hotel h = 1, 2, ..., H: draw φh ∼ Dir(λ)
• For each review r:

– Draw πr ∼ Dir(β)
– Draw φr ∼ Dir(λ)
– Draw θr ∼ Dir(α)
– For each word w in d:

∗ Draw yw ∼Multi(πr)
∗ If yw = 0:

· Draw w ∼Multi(φzw )

∗ If yw = 1: draw w ∼Multi(φB)
∗ If yw = 2: draw w ∼Multi(φd)
∗ If yw = 3: draw w ∼Multi(φh)
∗ If yw = 4: draw w ∼Multi(φc)

of H hotels, in C cities, we first draw multinomial
word distributions corresponding to: the background
topic, φB; aspect topics, φk for k ∈ [1,K]; review-
specific topics, φr for r ∈ [1, R]; hotel-specific top-
ics, φh for h ∈ [1, H]; and city-specific topics, φc
for c ∈ [1, C]. Then, for each word w in review
R, we sample a switch variable, y ∈ [0, 4], indicat-
ing whether w comes from one of the aspect topics
(y = 0), or the background topic (y = 1), review-
specific topic (y = 2), hotel-specific topic (y = 3)
or city-specific topic (y = 4). If the word comes
from one of the aspect topics, then we further sam-
ple the specific aspect topic, zw ∈ [1,K]. Finally,
we generate the word, w, from the corresponding φ.

4.2 Inference for RLDA
Given the review collection, our goal is to find the
most likely assignment yw (and zw if yw = 0) for
each word, w, in each review. We perform infer-
ence using Gibbs sampling. It is relatively straight-
forward to derive Gibbs sampling equations that al-
low joint sampling of the zw and yw latent variables
for each word token w:

iteration in Gibbs sampling, we obtain:

Finally, at the end of Gibbs sampling, we filter out

city-specific information, by replacing each docu-
ment’s term vector with a 1×K aspect-topic vector,
~Gr = 〈θ1r , θ2r , · · · , θKr 〉.

5 Manifold Ranking for Hotels

In this section, we describe our ranking algorithm —
based on manifold ranking (Zhou et al, 2003a; Zhou
et al, 2003b) — that tries to jointly model deceptive
language at the hotel-, review- and term-level.

5.1 Graph Construction

We use a three-layer (hotel layer, review layer and
term layer) mutual reinforcement model (see Fig-
ure 1). Formally, we represent our three-layer graph
as G = 〈VH , VR, VT , EHR, ERR, ERT , ETT 〉,
where VH = {Hi}i=NHi=1 , VR = {R}

i=HR
i=1 and

VT = {Ti}i=Vi=1 correspond to the set of hotels, re-
views and terms respectively. EHR, ERR and ERT
respectively denote the edges between hotels and re-
views, reviews and reviews and reviews and terms.
Each edge is associated with a weight that denotes
the similarity between two nodes.

Let sim(Hi, Rj), where Hi ∈ VH and Rj ∈ VR,
denote the edge weight between hotelHi and review
Rj , calculated as follows:

sim(Hi, Rj) =

{
1 if Ri ∈ Hj
0 if Ri 6∈ Hj

(2)

Then we get row normalized matrices DHR ∈
RNH×NR and DRH ∈ RNR×NH as follows:

DHR(i, j) =
sim(Hi, Rj)∑
i′ sim(Hi′ , Rj)

DRH(i, j) =
sim(Hi, Rj)∑
j′ sim(Hi, Rj′)

(3)

As described in Section 4.2, each review is rep-
resented with a 1 × K aspect vector Gr after fil-
tering undesired information. The edge weight be-
tween two reviews is then the cosine similarity,
sim(Ri, Rj), between two reviews and can be cal-
culated as follows:

sim(Ri, Rj) =

∑t=K
t=1 G

t
i ·Gtj√∑t=K

t=1 G
t2
i ·

√∑t=K
t=1 G

t2
j

(4)

Since the normalization process will make the
review-to-review relation matrix asymmetric, we
adopt the following strategy: let P denote the sim-
ilarity matrix between reviews, where P (i, j) =
sim(Ri, Rj) and M denotes the diagonal matrix
with (i,i)-element equal to the sum of the ith row
of SIM . The normalized matrix between reviews
DRR ∈ RNR×NR is calculated as follows:

DRR = M
− 12 · P ·M− 12 (5)

sim(Ri, wj) denotes the similarity between re-
view Ri and term wj and is the conditional prob-
ability of word wj given review Ri. If wj ∈ Rj ,
sim(Ri, wj) is calculated according to Eq. (6) by
integrating out latent parameters θ and π. Else if
wj 6∈ Rj , sim(Ri, wj) = 0.

sim(Ri, wj) =

Similar to Eq. (3), we further get the normalized ma-
trix DRT ∈ RHR×V and DTR ∈ RV×HR .

Similarity between terms sim(wi, wj) is given by
the WordNet path-similarity,5 normalized to create
the matrix DV V .

5Path-similarity is based on the shortest path that con-
nects the senses in the “is-a” (hypernym/hyponym) tax-
onomy. See http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/

Manifold Method

Based on the set of labeled reviews, nodes for truth-
ful reviews (positive) are initialized with a high
score (1) and nodes for deceptive reviews, a low
score (-1). Given the weighted graph, our task is
to assign a score to the each hotel, each term, and
the remaining unlabeled reviews. Let SH , SR and
ST denote the ranking scores of hotels, reviews and
terms, which are updated during each iteration as
follows until convergence6:

where �1 + �2 + �3 = 1 and �4 + �5 = 1. (The score

6 Learning Generalizable Classifiers

In Section 4, we introduced RLDA to filter out
review-, hotel- and city-specific information from
our vector-based review representation. Here, we
will directly evaluate the effectiveness of RLDA
by comparing the performance of binary deceptive
vs. truthful classifiers trained on three feature sets:
(a) the full vocabulary, encoded as unigrams and
bigrams (N-GRAMS); (b) a reduced-dimensionality
feature space, based on standard LDA (Blei et
al, 2003); and (c) a reduced-dimensionality feature

6Convergence is achieved if the difference between ranking
scores in two consecutive iterations is less than 0.00001.

space, based on our proposed revised LDA approach
(RLDA).

We compare two kinds of classifiers, which are
trained on only the labeled CHICAGO dataset and
tested on the FOUR-CITIES dataset. First, we use
SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) to train linear SVM clas-
sifiers, which have been shown to perform well in
related work (Ott et al, 2011). Second, we train a
two-layer manifold classifier, which is a simplified
version of the model presented in Section 5. In this
model, the graph consists of only review and term
layers, and the score of a labeled review is fixed to
1 or -1 in each iteration. After convergence, reviews
with scores greater than 0 are classified as truthful,
and less than 0 as deceptive.

Results and Discussion The results are shown in
Table 2 and show the average accuracy and preci-
sion/recall w.r.t. the truthful (positive) class. We find
that SVM and MANIFOLD are comparable in all six
conditions, and not surprisingly, perform best when
evaluated on reviews from the two Chicago hotels in
our FOUR-CITIES data. However, the N-GRAM and
LDA feature sets perform much worse than RDLA
when evaluation is performed on reviews from the
other three (non-Chicago) cities. This confirms that
classifiers trained on n-gram features overfit to the
training data (CHICAGO) and do not generalize well
to reviews from other cities. In addition, the stan-
dard LDA-based method for dimensionality reduc-
tion is not sufficient for our specific task.

7 Identifying Manipulated Hotels

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our
manifold ranking approach (see Section 5) on the
task of identifying manipulated hotels.

Baselines. We consider several baseline ranking
approaches to compare to our manifold ranking ap-
proach. Like the manifold ranking approach, the
baselines also employ both the CHICAGO dataset (la-
beled) and FOUR-CITIES dataset (without labels).7
For fair comparison, we use identical processing
techniques for each approach. Topic number is set

7While we have not investigated the effects of unlabeled data
in detail, providing additional unlabeled data (beyond the test
set) boosts the manifold ranking performances reported below
by 1-2%.

to five for all topic-model-based approaches. Each
baseline makes review-level predictions and then
ranks each hotel by the average of those predictions.

• Review-SVR: Uses linear Tranductive Support
Vector Regression with unigram and bigram fea-
tures, similar to Ott et al. (2011).
• Review-SVR+LDA (R): Similar to REVIEW-

SVR but uses our revised LDA (RLDA) topic
model for dimensionality reduction (R).
• Two-Layer Manifold (S): A simplified version of

our model where the hotel-level is removed from
the graph. Dimensionality reduction is performed
using standard LDA (S).
• Two-Layer Manifold (R): Similar to TWO-

LAYER MANIFOLD (S) but uses the revised LDA
(RLDA) model for dimensionality reduction.
• Three-layer Manifold (tf-idf): Our three-layer

manifold ranking model, except with each review
represented as a TF-IDF term vector. Review sim-
ilarity is calculated based on the cosine similarity
between these vectors.

Evaluation Method. To evaluate ranking perfor-
mance in the absence of a gold standard set of ma-
nipulated hotels, we rearrange the FOUR-CITIES test
set of 40 truthful and 40 deceptive reviews for each
of eight hotels: we create 41 versions of each hotel,
where each hotel version contains a different num-
ber of injected deceptive reviews, ranging from 0 to
40. For example, the first version of a hotel will have
40 truthful and 0 deceptive reviews, the second ver-
sion 39 truthful and 1 deceptive, and the 41st ver-
sion 0 truthful and 40 deceptive. In total, we gen-
erate 41 × 8 = 328 versions of hotel reviews. We
expect versions with larger proportions of deceptive

reviews to receive lower scores by the ranking mod-
els (i.e., they are ranked higher/more deceptive).

Metrics. To qualitatively evaluate the ranking re-
sults, we use the Normalized Discounted Cumula-
tive Gain (NDCG), which is commonly used to eval-
uate retrieval algorithms with respect to an ideal
relevance-based ranking. In particular, NDCG re-
wards rankings with the most relevant results at the
top positions (Liu, 2009), which is also our objec-
tive, namely, to rank versions that have higher pro-
portions of deceptive reviews nearer to the top.

Let R(m) denote the relevance score of mth
ranked hotel version. Then, NDCGN is defined as:

NDCGN =
1

IDCGN

m=N∑
m=1

2R(m) − 1
log2(1 +m)

(8)

where IDCGN refers to discounted cumulative gain
(DCG) of the ideal ranking of the top N results. We
define the ideal ranking according to the proportion
of deceptive reviews in different versions, and re-
port NDCG scores for theNth ranked hotel versions
(N = 8 to 321), at intervals of 8 (to account for ties
among the eight hotels).

Results and Discussion. NDCG results are shown
in Figure 5. We observe that our approach (using
2, 5 or 10 topics) generally outperforms the other
approaches. In particular, approaches that use our
RLDA text representation (OUR APPROACH, TWO-
LAYER MANIFOLD (R), and REVIEW-SVR+LDA
(R)), which tries to remove city- and hotel-specific
information, perform better than those that use
the full vocabulary (REVIEW-SVR, TWO-LAYER
MANIFOLD (S), and THREE-LAYER MANIFOLD
(TF-IDF)). This further confirms that our RLDA
dimensionality reduction technique allows models,

trained on limited data, to generalize to reviews of
different hotels and in different locations. We also
find that approaches that model a reinforcing rela-
tionship between hotels and their reviews are bet-
ter than approaches that model reviews as inde-
pendent units, e.g., TWO-LAYER MANIFOLD (R)
vs. REVIEW-SVR+LDA and TWO-LAYER MANI-
FOLD (S) vs. REVIEW-SVR. This confirms our in-
tuition that a hotel is more deceptive if it is con-
nected with many deceptive reviews, and, in turn,
a review is more deceptive if from a deceptive hotel.

8 Qualitative Evaluation

We now present qualitative evaluations for the
RLDA topic model and the manifold ranking model.

Topic Quality. Table 3 gives the top words for
four aspect topics and four city-specific topics in the
RLDA topic model; Table 4 gives the highest and
lowest ranking term weights in our three-layer man-
ifold model. By comparing the first row of topics in
Table 3, corresponding to aspect topics, to the top
words in Table 4, we observe that the learned top-
ics relate to truthful and deceptive classes. For ex-
ample, Topics 1 and 4 share many terms with the
top truthful terms in the manifold model, e.g., spa-
tial terms, such as location, floor and block,
and punctuation, such as (, ), and $. Similarly,
Topics 2 and 7 share many terms with the top de-
ceptive terms in the manifold model, e.g., hotel,
husband, wife, amazing, experience and
recommend. This makes sense, since topic models
have been shown to produce discriminative topics on

Topic1 Topic2 Topic4 Topic7

Table 3: Top words in topics extracted from RLDA topic
model (see Section 4). The top row presents topic words
from four aspect topics (K = 10) and the bottom row
presents top words from four city-specific topics.

this data in previous work (Li et al., 2013).

With respect to the second row in Table 4, con-
taining top words from city-specific topics, we ob-
serve that each topic does contain primarily city-
specific information. This helps to explain why re-
moving terms associated with these topics resulted
in a better vector representation for reviews.

Real-world Evaluation. Finally, we apply our
ranking model to a large-scale collection of real-
world reviews from TripAdvisor. We crawl 878,561
reviews from 3,945 hotels in 25 US cities from Tri-
pAdvisor excluding all non-5-star reviews and re-
moving hotels with fewer than 100 reviews. In the
end, we collect 244,810 reviews from 838 hotels.

We apply our manifold ranking model and rank
all 838 hotels. First, we present a histogram of the
resulting manifold ranking scores in Figure 6. We
observe that the distribution reaches a peak around
0.04, which in our quantitative evaluation (Sec-
tion 7) corresponded to a hotel with 34 truthful and
6 deceptive reviews. These results suggest that the
majority of reviews in TripAdvisor are truthful, in
line with previous findings by Ott et al. (2011).

Next, we note that previous work has hypothe-
sized that deceptive reviews are more likely to be
posted by first-time review writers, or singleton re-
viewers (Ott et al, 2011; Wu et al, 2011). Accord-
ingly, if this hypothesis were valid, then manipu-
lated hotels would have an above-average proportion

of singleton reviews. Figure 7 shows a histogram
of the average proportion of singleton reviews, as
a function of the ranking scores produced by our
model. Noting that lower scores correspond to a
higher predicted proportion of deceptive reviews, we
observe that hotels that are ranked as being more de-
ceptive by our model have much higher proportions
of singleton reviews, on average, compared to hotels
ranked as less deceptive.

9 Conclusion

We study the problem of identifying manipulated of-
ferings on review portals and propose a novel three-
layer graph model, based on manifold ranking for
ranking offerings based on the proportion of reviews
expected to be instances of deceptive opinion spam.
Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of
our model over several learning-based baselines.
