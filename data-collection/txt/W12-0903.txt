Probabilistic Models of Grammar Acquisition

The most convincing models of human grammar acquisition to date are supervised, in the sense
that they learn from pairs of strings and meaning representations (Siskind, 1996; Villavicencio, 2002;
Villavicencio, 2011; Buttery, 2004; Buttery, 2006; Kwiatkowski et al., 2012). Although the principles
by which such models learn are quite general, the datasets they have been applied to have unavoidably
been somewhat target-language-specific, and are also limited to discourse-external world-state-related
content, contrary to the observations of (Tomasello, 2001) concerning the central role of common
ground and grounding in interpersonal interaction.

I’ll review the state of the art in the light of these limitations on the datasets, and try to make some
suggestions about how we might obtain more realistic and challenging artificial and natural datasets
using both automatic and human labeling methods.
