Abstract

We propose a novel end-to-end frame-
work for abstractive meeting summariza-
tion. We cluster sentences in the in-
put into communities and build an entail-
ment graph over the sentence communi-
ties to identify and select the most relevant
sentences. We then aggregate those se-
lected sentences by means of a word graph
model. We exploit a ranking strategy to
select the best path in the word graph as
an abstract sentence. Despite not relying
on the syntactic structure, our approach
significantly outperforms previous models
for meeting summarization in terms of in-
formativeness. Moreover, the longer sen-
tences generated by our method are com-
petitive with shorter sentences generated
by the previous word graph model in terms
of grammaticality.

1 Introduction

The huge amount of data generated every day in
meetings calls for developing automated methods
to efficiently process these data to meet users’
needs. Automatic summarization is a popular task
that can help users to browse a large amount of
recorder speech in text format. This paper tackles
the task of recorded meeting summarization, ad-
dressing the key limitations of existing approaches
by proposing the following contributions:

1) Various approaches that were recently devel-
oped for meeting summarization (such as (Gillick
et al., 2009; Garg et al., 2009)) focus on extract-
ing important sentences (or dialogue acts) from
speech transcripts, either manual transcripts or au-
tomatic speech recognition (ASR) output. How-
ever, it has been observed in the context of meet-
ing summarization users generally prefer concise
abstracts over extracts, and abstracts lead to higher

objective task scores; likewise automatic abstrac-
tive summaries are preferred in comparison with
human extracts (Murray et al., 2010). Moreover,
most of the abstractive summarization approaches
focus on one component of the system, such as
generation (e.g., (Genest and Lapalme, 2010)) or
content selection (e.g., (Murray et al., 2012)), in-
stead of developing the full framework for abstrac-
tive summarization. To address these limitations,
as the main contribution of this paper, we pro-
pose a full pipeline to generate an abstractive sum-
mary for each meeting transcript. Our system is
similar to that of Murray et al. (2010) in terms
of generating abstractive summaries for meeting
transcripts. However, we take a lighter supervi-
sion for the content selection phase and a different
approach towards the language generation phase,
which does not rely on the conventional Natural
Language Generation (NLG) architecture (Reiter
and Dale, 2000).

2) We propose a word graph based approach
to aggregate and generate the abstractive sentence
summary. Our work extends the word graph
method proposed by Filippova (2010) with the fol-
lowing novel contributions: i) We take advantage
of lexical knowledge to merge similar nodes by
finding their relations in WordNet; ii) We gener-
ate new sentences through generalization and ag-
gregation of the original ones, which means that
our generated sentences are not necessarily com-
posed of the original words; and iii) We adopt a
new ranking strategy to select the best path in the
graph by taking the information content and the
grammaticality (i.e. fluency) of the sentence into
consideration.

3) In order to generate an abstract summary for
a meeting, we have to be able to capture the over-
all content of the conversation. This can be done
by identifying the essential content from the most
informative sentences using the semantic relations
among all sentences in a meeting transcript. How-

136



ever, most current methods disregard such rela-
tions in favor of statistical models of word distri-
butions and frequencies. Moreover, the data from
meeting transcripts often contains many highly re-
dundant sentences. As one of the key contribu-
tions of this paper, we propose to build a multi-
directional entailment graph over the sentences to
identify and select relevant information from the
most informative sentences.

4) The textual data from meeting conversa-
tion transcripts are typically in a casual style and
do not exhibit a clear syntactic structure with
proper grammar and spelling. Therefore, abstrac-
tive summarization approaches developed for for-
mal texts, such as scientific or news articles, of-
ten are not satisfactory when dealing with infor-
mal texts. Our proposed method for abstractive
meeting summarization requires minimal syntac-
tic and structural information and is robust in deal-
ing with text that suffers from transcription errors,
ill-formed sentences and unknown lexical choices
such as typically formed in meeting transcripts.

We evaluate our system over meeting tran-
scripts. Our result compares favorably to the result
of previous extractive and abstractive approaches
in terms of information content. Moreover, we
show that our method can generate longer sen-
tences with competitive grammaticality scores, in
comparison with previous abstractive approaches.
Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of each com-
ponent of our system through an ablation test.
As an additional result of our experiments, we
also show that using semantic relations (entail-
ment graph) is important in efficiently performing
the final step of our summarization pipeline (i.e.,
the sentence fusion).

2 Abstractive Summarization

Framework

Similar to Murray et al. (2010), our goal is to
generate a meeting summary, i.e. a set of sen-
tences, that could capture the semantics of the
meeting. While (Murray et al., 2010) requires
extensive annotations to train several classifiers
to detect important sentences, opinions and dia-
log acts, we only use a subset of that annotation,
which includes a human abstract and links from
each sentence in the abstract to the source meet-
ing sentences. In addition, instead of generat-
ing an abstractive sentence via the conventional
NLG pipeline (Reiter and Dale, 2000), we exploit

a word graph approach.

1Figure 1: Meeting summarization framework.

As shown in Figure 1, our framework consists
of three main components, which we describe in
more detail in the following sections.

2.1 Community Detection

While some abstractive summary sentences are
very similar to original sentences from the meeting
transcript, others can be created by aggregating
and merging multiple sentences into an abstract
sentence. In order to generate such a sentence, we
need to identify which sentences from the original
meeting transcript should be combined in gener-
ated abstract sentences. This task can be consid-
ered as the first step of abstractive meeting sum-
marization and is called “abstractive community
detection (ACD)” (Murray et al., 2012). To per-
form ACD, we follow the same method proposed
by Murray et al. (2012), in two steps:

First, we classify sentence pairs according to
whether or not they should be realized by a com-
mon abstractive sentence. For each pair, we ex-
tract its structural and linguistic features, and we
train a logistic regression classifier over all our
training data (described in Section 3.1) exploiting
such features. We run the trained classier over sen-
tence pairs, predicting abstractive links between
sentences in the document. The result can be rep-
resented as an undirected graph where nodes are
the sentences, and edges represent whether two
nodes are linked.

Second, we have to identify which nodes (i.e.,
sentences from the meeting transcript) can be clus-
tered as a community to generate an abstract sen-
tence. For this purpose, we apply the CONGA al-
gorithm (Gregory, 2007) for community detection
that uses betweenness to detect communities in a
graph. The betweenness score for an edge is the
number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes
in the graph that run along that edge.

If a sentence is not connected to at least one
other sentence in the first step, it’s assigned to its
own singleton community.

rows and “x” represent the entailment direction and unknown
cases respectively.

2.2 Entailment Graph

Sentences in a community often include redundant
information which are semantically equivalent but
vary in lexical choices. By identifying the seman-
tic relations between the sentences in each com-
munity, we can discover the information in one
sentence that is semantically equivalent, novel, or
more/less informative with respect to the content
of the other sentences.

Similar to earlier work (Lloret et al., 2008;
Mehdad et al., 2010; Berant et al., 2011; Adler et
al., 2012; Mehdad et al., 2013), we set this prob-
lem as a variant of the Textual Entailment (TE)
recognition task (Dagan and Glickman, 2004). We
build an entailment graph for each community of
sentences, where nodes are the linked sentences
and edges are the entailment relations between
nodes. Given two sentences (s1 and s2), we aim
at identifying the following cases:
i) s1 and s2 express the same meaning (bidirec-
tional entailment). In such cases one of the sen-
tences should be eliminated;
ii) s1 is more informative than s2 (unidirectional
entailment). In such cases, the entailing sentence
should replace or complement the entailed one;
iii) s1 contains facts that are not present in s2, and
vice-versa (the “unknown” cases in TE parlance).
In such cases, both sentences should remain.

Figure 2 shows how entailment relations can
help in selecting the sentences by removing the re-
dundant and less informative ones. As we show in
the figure, the sentence “A” entails “E”, “F” and
“G”, but not “B”. So we can keep “A” and “B”
and eliminate others. For example, the sentence

“we should discuss about the remote control and
its color” entails “about the remote”, “let’s talk
about the remote” and “um remote’s color”, but
not “remote’s size is also important”. So we can
keep “we should discuss about the remote con-
trol and its color” and “remote’s size is also im-
portant” and eliminate the others. In this way,
TE-based sentence identification can be designed
to distinguish meaning-preserving variations from
true divergence, regardless of lexical choices and
structures.

Similar to previous approaches in TE (e.g., (Be-
rant et al., 2011)), we use a supervised method. To
train and build the entailment graph, we perform
three steps described in the following subsections.

2.2.1 Training set collection

In the last few years, TE corpora have been cre-
ated and distributed in the framework of several
evaluation campaigns, including the Recognizing
Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge1 and Cross-
lingual textual entailment for content synchroniza-
tion2 (Negri et al., 2012). However, such datasets
cannot directly support our application, since the
RTE datasets are often composed of longer well-
formed sentences and paragraphs (Bentivogli et
al., 2009; Negri et al., 2011).

In order to collect a dataset that is more sim-
ilar to the goal of our entailment framework, we
select a subset of the sixth and seventh RTE chal-
lenge main task (i.e., RTE within a Corpus). Our
dataset choice is based on the following reasons:
i) the length of sentence pairs in RTE6 and RTE7
is shorter than the others, and ii) RTE6 and RTE7
main task datasets are originally created for sum-
marization purpose, which is closer to our work.
We sort the RTE6 and RTE7 dataset pairs based
on the sentence length and choose the first 2000
samples with an equal number of positive and neg-
ative examples. The average length of words in
our training data is 7 words. There are certainly
some differences between our training set and our
sentences from the meeting corpus. However, the
collected training samples was the closest avail-
able dataset to our needs.

2.2.2 Feature representation and training

Working with meeting transcripts imposes some
constraints on feature selection. Meeting tran-
scripts are not often well-formed in terms of sen-

1http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Challenges/RTE/

138



tence structure and contain errors. This limits
our features to the lexical level. Fortunately, lexi-
cal models are less computationally expensive and
easier to implement and often deliver a strong per-
formance for RTE (Sammons et al., 2011).

Our entailment decision criterion is based on
similarity scores calculated with a sentence-to-
sentence matching process. Each example pair of
sentences (s1 and s2) is represented by a feature
vector, where each feature is a specific similarity
score estimating whether s1 entails s2.

We compute 18 similarity scores for each pair
of sentences. Before aggregating the similarity
scores to form an entailment score, we normalize
the similarity scores by the length of s2 (in terms
of lexical items), when checking the entailment di-
rection from s1 to s2. In this way, we can estimate
the portion of information/facts in s2 which is cov-
ered by s1.

The first five scores are computed based on the
exact lexical overlap between the phrases: word
overlap, edit distance, ngram-overlap, longest
common subsequence and Lesk (Lesk, 1986).
The other scores were computed using lexical
resources: WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), VerbO-
cean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), paraphrases
(Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) and phrase match-
ing (Mehdad et al., 2011). We used WordNet
to compute the word similarity as the least com-
mon subsumer between two words considering the
synonymy-antonymy, hypernymy-hyponymy, and
meronymy relations. Then, we calculated the sen-
tence similarity as the sum of the similarity scores
of the word pairs in Text and Hypothesis, nor-
malized by the number of words in Hypothesis.
We also use phrase matching features described in
(Mehdad et al., 2011) which consists of phrasal
matching at the level on ngrams (1 to 5 tokens).
The rationale behind using different entailment
features is that combining various scores will yield
a better model (Berant et al., 2011).

To combine the entailment scores and optimize
their relative weights, we train a Support Vector
Machine binary classifier, SVMlight (Joachims,
1999), over an equal number of positive and nega-
tive examples. This results in an entailment model
with 95% accuracy over 2-fold and 5-fold cross-
validation, which further proves the effectiveness
of our feature set for this lexical entailment model.
The reason that we gained a very high accuracy
is because our selected sentences are a subset

of RTE6 and RTE7 with a shorter length (fewer
words) which makes the entailment recognition
task much easier than recognizing entailment be-
tween paragraphs or long sentences.

2.2.3 Entailment graph edge labeling

Since our training examples are labeled with bi-
nary judgments, we are not able to train a three-
way classifier. Therefore, we set the edge label-
ing problem as a two-way classification task that
casts multidirectional entailment as a unidirec-
tional problem, where each pair is analyzed check-
ing for entailment in both directions (Mehdad et
al., 2012). In this condition, each original test
example is correctly classified if both pairs origi-
nated from it are correctly judged (“YES-YES” for
bidirectional,“YES-NO” and “NO-YES” for unidi-
rectional entailment and “NO-NO” for unknown
cases). Two-way classification represents an intu-
itive solution to capture multidimensional entail-
ment relations.

2.2.4 Identification and selection

By assigning all entailment relations between the
extracted sentence pairs, we identify relevant sen-
tences to eliminate the redundant (in terms of
meaning) and less informative ones. In order to
perform this task we follow a set of rules based
on the graph edge labels. Note that since entail-
ment is a transitive relation, our entailment graph
is transitive i.e., if entail(s1,s2) and entail(s2,s3)
then entail(s1,s3) (Berant et al., 2011).
Rule 1) Among the nodes that are connected with
bidirectional entailment (semantically equivalent
nodes) we keep only the one with more outgo-
ing bidirectional and unidirectional entailment re-
lations;
Rule 2) If there is a chain of entailing nodes, we
keep the one that is the root of the chain and elim-
inate others.

2.3 Multi-sentence Fusion

Sentence fusion is a well-known challenge for
summarization systems. In this phase, our goal
is to generate an understandable informative sen-
tence that maximally captures the content of the
sentences in a sentence community.

There are several ways of generating an abstract
sentence (e.g. (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Liu
and Liu, 2009; Ganesan et al., 2010; Murray et
al., 2010)); however, most of them rely heavily
on the syntactic structure. We believe that such

approaches are suboptimal, especially in dealing
with written conversational data (e.g., email) or
the data from speech transcripts, whether manual
transcription or automatic speech recognition out-
put. Instead, we apply an approach that does not
rely on syntax, nor on a standard NLG architec-
ture. More specifically, we build a word graph
from all the words of the sentences in a commu-
nity and aggregate them in order to generate a new
abstractive sentence.

We perform the task of multi-sentence fusion in
two steps. First, we construct a word graph over
sentences in each community that were selected
from the entailment graph. Second, we rank the
valid paths in the word graph and select the top
path as the abstract sentence summary.

2.3.1 Constructing a Word Graph

In order to construct a word graph, our model ex-
tends the word graph method proposed by Filip-
pova (2010) with the following novel contribu-
tions:

1- The basic word graph method disregards se-
mantic and lexical relations between the words
in constructing the word graph, in favor of re-
dundancy and word frequencies. To move be-
yond such limitation, we take advantage of lexi-
cal knowledge to map the similar nodes by finding
their relations in WordNet. In this way, for exam-
ple, two synonym words can be mapped into the
same node.

2- Filippova’s approach is essentially extractive
in nature, which means the generated sentence is
composed by the same words from the original
sentences. We move beyond this by generating
new sentences through generalization and aggre-
gation of the original ones. This means that our
generated sentences are not necessarily composed
of the original words. In this way, we are one step
closer to abstractive summarization.

3- Our proposed method aggregates and gen-
erates new readable sentences, regardless of their

lengths, that can semantically imply several orig-
inal sentences, by taking the information content
and the readability (i.e. fluency) of the sentence
into consideration.

Following Filippova’s method, given a set of re-
lated sentences, we build a word graph by itera-
tively adding sentences to it. Figure 1 illustrates
a small graph composed of 4 sentences, including
the start and end nodes.

1- we must determine the use of uh remote.
2- The remote control is important because the

cost.
3- um we should choose the control.
4- The remote price is crucial.

As one of the main steps of word graph con-
struction, we merge the words that have the same
POS tags under the following conditions:

1) The words are identical (e.g. “remote”).

2) The words are synonyms. The replacement
choice is based on the word’s commonality, i.e.
tfidf (e.g. “important” and “crucial”).

3) The words form a hypernym/hyponym pair or
share a common hypernym. Both words are re-
placed by the hypernym (e.g. “price” and “cost”).

4) The words are in an entailment relation. Both
words are replaced by the entailed one (e.g. “pay”
and “buy”).

Note that, similar to Filippova’s approach,
where merging is ambiguous we check the context
(a word before and after in the sentence and the
neighboring nodes in the graph) and select the can-
didate that has larger overlap in the context, or the
one with a greater frequency. Similar to the origi-
nal word graph model, we connect adjacent words
with directed edges. For the new nodes or uncon-
nected nodes, we draw an edge with a weight of
1. In contrast, weights between already connected
nodes are increased by 1.

140



2.3.2 Path Selection and Ranking

The word graph, as described above, will generate
many sequences connecting start and end. How-
ever, it is likely that most of the paths are not read-
able. Since we are aiming at generating a good
abstractive sentence, some constraints need to be
considered.

A good abstractive sentence should cover most
of the concepts that exist in the original sentences.
Moreover, it should be grammatically correct.

In order to satisfy these constraints we adopt a
ranking strategy that combines the characteristics
of a good summary sentence. To filter ungram-
matical sentences, we prune the paths in which a
verb does not exist. Our ranking formulation is
summarized as below:

Fluency: Our word graph process generates
many possible paths as abstractive summaries.
We need now to decide which of these paths
are more readable and fluent. As in other areas
of NLP (e.g. machine translation and speech
recognition), the answer can be estimated by a
language model. We assign a probability Pr(P )
to each path P based on a n-gram language model.

Pr(P ) =
mY

i=1

Pr(pi|pi�11 ) ⇡
mY

i=1

Pr(pi|pi�1i�n+1)

⇡
mX

i=1

�logPr(pi|pi�1i�n+1)

Coverage: To identify the summary with the high-
est coverage, we propose a second score that esti-
mates the number of nouns that appear in the path.
In order to reward the ranking score to cover more
salient nouns, we also consider the tfidf score of
nouns in the coverage formulation.

C overage(P ) =

P
pi2P tfidf (pi)P
pi2G tfidf (pi)

where the pi are nouns and G is the graph.

Edge weight: As a third score, we adopt the Filip-
pova’s edge weighting formulation w(pi, pj) and
define the edge weight of the path W (P ) as be-

low:

w(pi, pj) =
freq(pi) + freq(pj)P
P2G

pi,pj2P
di↵ (P, pi, pj)�1

W (P ) =

Pm�1
i=1 w(pi, pi+1)

m� 1

where the function diff(P, pi, pj) refers to the
distance between the offset positions pos(P, pi)
of words pi and pj in path P and is defined as
|pos(P, pj) � pos(P, pi)| and m is the number of
words in path P .

Ranking score: In order to generate a summary
sentence that combines the scores above, we
employ a ranking model. The purpose of such
a model is three-fold: i) to generate a more
readable and grammatical sentence; ii) to cover
the content of original sentences optimally; and
iii) to favor strong connections between the
concepts. Therefore, the final ranking score of
path P is calculated over the normalized scores as:

Score(P ) =
Pr(P )⇥ Coverage(P )

W (P )

We select all the paths that contain at least one
verb and rerank them using our proposed ranking
function to find the best path as the summary of
the original sentences.

3 Experiments and Results

We now describe a preliminary, formative evalua-
tion of our framework, whose main goal is to as-
sess strengths and weaknesses of the various com-
ponents and generate ideas for further develop-
ments.

3.1 Dataset

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we ex-
periment with the AMI meeting corpus (Carletta
et al., 2005) that consists of 140 multi-party meet-
ings with a wide range of annotations, including
abstactive summaries for each meeting and links
from each sentence in the summary to the set of
sentences in the original transcripts that sentence
is summarizing. We use this information as our
gold standard since it provides many examples in
which a set of sentences in the meeting (a commu-
nity) is linked to a human written sentence sum-
marizing that community.

141



In our experiments, we use human authored
transcripts. Note that our approach is not specific
to conversations, however it is designed to deal
with ill-formed sentences and structural errors.
Moreover, the first two components of our sys-
tem are supervised, while the word graph model
is completely unsupervised and domain indepen-
dent.

In order to train our logistic regression classifier
for the first phase of our pipeline, we randomly
select a training set that consists of 98 meetings.
Note that there are about one million sentence pair
instances in the training set since we consider ev-
ery pairing of sentences within a meeting. The rest
is selected as a test set for the evaluation phase.

3.2 Experimental Settings

For preprocessing our dataset we use OpenNLP3

for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging. When
the number of sentences in each community is
more than 10 (which happens in around 10% of
the cases), the community is first clustered using
the MajorClust (Stein and Niggemann, 1999) al-
gorithm when sentences are represented as nor-
malized tfidf vectors and the similarity between
the sentences is measured using cosine similarity.
Then, each cluster is treated as a separate com-
munity. The clustering guarantees a higher over-
lap between the sentences as well as a word graph
with fewer paths. Next, we construct a word graph
over each cluster and rank the valid paths. We
choose the first ranked path as the abstractive sum-
mary of the cluster. For our language model, we
use a tri-gram smoothed language model trained
using the newswire text provided in the English
Gigaword corpus (Graff and Cieri, ).

3.3 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate performance, we use the ROUGE-1
and ROUGE-2 (unigram and bigram overlap) F1
score, which correlate well with human rankings
of summary quality (Lin and Hovy, 2003). We
also ignore stopwords to reduce the impact of high
overlap when matching them.

Furthermore, to evaluate the grammaticality of
our generated summaries in comparison with the
original word graph method, following common
practice (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005), we ran-
domly selected 10 meeting summaries (total 150
sentences). Then, we asked annotators to give one

summary based on grammaticality: perfect (2 pts),
only one mistake (1 pt) and not acceptable (0 pts),
ignoring the capitalization or punctuation. Each
meeting was rated by two annotators (Computer
Science graduate students).

3.4 Baselines

We compare our approach with various extrac-
tive baselines: 1) MMR-centroid system (Car-
bonell and Goldstein, 1998); 2) MMR-cosine sys-
tem (Gillick et al., 2009); 3) ILP-based system
(Gillick et al., 2009); 4) TextRank system (Mihal-
cea and Tarau, 2004); and 5) ClusterRank system
(Garg et al., 2009) and with one abstractive base-
line: 6) Original word graph model (Orig. word
graph) (Filippova, 2010).

In order to measure the effectiveness of dif-
ferent components, we also evaluated our sys-
tem using human-annotated sentence communities
(GC) in comparison with our community detection
model (full). Moreover, we measure the perfor-
mance of our system (GC) ablating the entailment
module (-ent).

3.5 Results

Table 1 shows the results for our proposed ap-
proach in comparison with these strong baselines
for meeting summarization. The results show that
our model outperforms the baselines significantly4

for ROUGE-1 over human transcripts for meet-
ing conversations, which proves the effectiveness
of our approach in dealing with summarization of

meeting conversations. However, the ClusterRank
and TextRank systems outperform our model for
ROUGE-2 score. This can be due to word merging
and word replacement choices in the word graph
construction (see Section 2.3.1), which sometimes
changes a word in a bigram and consequently de-
creases the bigram overlap score. A more detailed
analysis of this problem is left as future work.

Note that there is a drop in ROUGE score when
we use entailment in our system in comparison
with ablating the entailment phase (-ent). This is
mainly due to the fact that the entailment phase
filters equivalent sentences. This affects the re-
sults negatively when such filtered sentences share
many common words with our human-authored
abstracts. We believe that this drop is partly as-
sociated with our evaluation metric rather than
meaning. In other words, we expect no difference
in performance when a human evaluation is ap-
plied. However, the entailment phase helps in im-
proving the efficiency of our pipeline significantly.
If each graph has e edges, n nodes, and p paths,
then finding all the paths results in time complex-
ity O((np + 1)(e + n)), using depth-first search.
Decreasing the number of sentences will reduce
the number of nodes and edges, which leads to
the smaller number of paths. This is even more
significant when there are many sentences in a
community in comparison with the gold standard.
Note that it’s impossible to finish the graph build-
ing phase after 12 hours on a 2.3 GHz quad-core
machine without performing the entailment phase,
when we use our community detection model.
This would be especially problematic in a real-
time setting.

Comparing the gold standard sentence commu-
nities (GC) and our fully automatic system, we can
notice that inaccuracies in the community detec-
tion phase affects the overall performance. How-
ever, using our community detection model, we
still outperform the previous models significantly.

Table 2 shows grammaticality scores, distribu-
tions over the three scores and average sentence
lengths in tokens. The results demonstrate that
47% of the sentences generated by our method are

grammatically correct and 39% of the generated
sentences are almost correct. In comparison with
the original word graph method, our model reports
slightly lower results for the grammaticality score
and the percentage of correct sentences. How-
ever, considering the correlation between sentence
length and grammatical complexity, our model is
capable of generating longer sentences with more
information content (according to ROUGE) and
competitive grammaticality scores.

4 Discussion

After analyzing the results and through manual
verification of some cases, we observe that our ap-
proach produces some interestingly successful ex-
amples. Nevertheless, it appears that the perfor-
mance is still far from satisfactory. This leaves an
interesting challenge for the research community
to tackle. We have identified five different sources
of error:
Type 1: Abstractive human-authored summaries:
the nature of our method is based on extracting
the relevant sentences and generating an abstract
sentence by aggregating such sentences. Also due
to this, our generated abstracts are often infor-
mal and closer to the transcripts’ style. However,
in many cases, the human-written summaries are
composed by understanding the original sentences
and produce a formal style abstract sentence, of-
ten using a different vocabulary and structure. For
example:

Human-authored: The industrial designer and user in-
terface designer presented the prototype they created,
which was designed to look like a banana.
System: Working on the principle of a fruit it’s basically
designed around a banana.

Type 2: Evaluation method: The current evalu-
ation methods fail to capture the meaning and re-
lies only on matching the words at uni- or bigram
level. Therefore, we believe that a manual eval-
uation can reveal more potential of our system in
generating abstractive summaries that are closer to
human-written summaries.

Human-authored: the project manager recapped the de-
cisions made in the previous meeting.
System: I told you guys about the three new require-
ments ... so that was the last meeting.

Type 3: Subjective abstractive summaries: of-
ten it is not easy for humans to agree on one sum-
mary for a meeting. It is well known that inter-
annotator agreement is quite low for the summa-
rization task (Mani, 2001). For example:

Human-authored 1: They do tool training with a white-
board and each person introduces themselves and draws
their favorite animal on the board.
Human-authored 2: The group introduced themselves to
each other and acquainted themselves with the meeting-
room materials by drawing on the whiteboard.
System: We are gonna know each other and then draw
your little animal.

Type 4: Speaker information: since the nature of
our method is based on extracting the relevant sen-
tences or speaker utterances, we do not take the
speaker information into consideration. However,
the human-written summaries for meetings take
the speaker into account. We plan to extend our
framework to include this feature. For example:

Human-authored: The project manager opened the
meeting and stated the agenda to the team members.
System: I hope you’re ready for this functional design
meeting know at the end projects requirement.

Type 5: Transcription errors: as mentioned be-
fore, the meeting transcripts often contain struc-
ture, grammar, vocabulary choice and dictation er-
rors. This always raises more challenges for algo-
rithms dealing with such texts. For example:

Transcript: if it i if it isn’t more expensive for us to k
make because as far as I understand it.

In light of this analysis, we conclude that a
more comprehensive evaluation method (e.g., hu-
man evaluation), including speaker information in
the pipeline and using text normalization tech-
niques to reduce the effects of noisy transcripts can
better reveal the potential of our system in dealing
with meeting summarization.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we study the problem of abstrac-
tive meeting summarization, and propose a novel
framework to generate summaries composed of
grammatical sentences. Within this framework,
this paper makes three main contributions. First,
in contrast with most current methods based on
fully extractive models, we propose to take advan-
tage of a word graph model for sentence fusion
to generate abstractive summary sentences. Sec-
ond, beyond most of the current approaches which
disregard semantic information, we integrate se-
mantics by means of building textual entailment
graphs over sentence communities. Third, our
framework uses minimal syntactic information in
comparison with previous methods and does not
require a domain specific, engineered conven-
tional NLP component.

We successfully applied our framework over
a challenging meeting dataset, the AMI corpus.
Some significant improvements over our dataset,
in comparison with previous methods, demon-
strates the potential of our approach in dealing
with meeting summarization. Moreover, we prove
that our model can generate longer sentences with
only a minimal loss in grammaticality.

In light of the results of our preliminary forma-
tive evaluation, future work will address the im-
provement of the community detection and sen-
tence fusion phases. On the one hand, we plan to
improve our community detection graph by adding
more relevant features into our current supervised
model. On the other hand, we plan to incorporate
a better source of lexical knowledge in the word
graph construction (e.g., YAGO or DBpedia). We
are also interested in improving our ranking model
by assigning tuned weights to each component. In
addition, we are exploring the replacement of pro-
nouns by their referents (e.g., replacing “I” by the
name or role of the speaker) to improve both the
entailment and word graph models. Once we will
have explored all these improvements, we plan to
run more comprehensive human evaluations.
