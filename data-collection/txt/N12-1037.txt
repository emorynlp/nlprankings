Abstract

We present a classifier that discriminates be-
tween types of corrections made by teachers
of English in student essays. We define a set
of linguistically motivated feature templates
for a log-linear classification model, train this
classifier on sentence pairs extracted from
the Cambridge Learner Corpus, and achieve
89% accuracy improving upon a 33% base-
line. Furthermore, we incorporate our classi-
fier into a novel application that takes as input
a set of corrected essays that have been sen-
tence aligned with their originals and outputs
the individual corrections classified by error
type. We report the F-Score of our implemen-
tation on this task.

1 Introduction

In a typical foreign language education classroom
setting, teachers are presented with student essays
that are often fraught with errors. These errors can
be grammatical, semantic, stylistic, simple spelling
errors, etc. One task of the teacher is to isolate these
errors and provide feedback to the student with cor-
rections. In this body of work, we address the pos-
sibility of augmenting this process with NLP tools
and techniques, in the spirit of Computer Assisted
Language Learning (CALL).

We propose a step-wise approach in which a
teacher first corrects an essay and then a computer
program aligns their output with the original text and
separates and classifies independent edits. With the
program’s analysis the teacher would be provided
accurate information that could be used in effective

lesson planning tailored to the students’ strengths
and weaknesses.

This suggests a novel NLP task with two compo-
nents: The first isolates individual corrections made
by the teacher, and the second classifies these cor-
rections into error types that the teacher would find
useful. A suitable corpus for developing this pro-
gram is the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) (Yan-
nakoudakis et al., 2011). The CLC contains approxi-
mately 1200 essays with error corrections annotated
in XML within sentences. Furthermore, these cor-
rections are tagged with linguistically motivated er-
ror type codes.

To the best of our knowledge our proposed task
is unexplored in previous work. However, there is
a significant amount of related work in automated
grammatical error correction (Fitzgerald et al., 2009;
Gamon, 2011; West et al., 2011). The Helping
Our Own (HOO) shared task (Dale and Kilgarriff,
2010) also explores this issue, with Rozovskaya et
al. (2011) as the best performing system to date.
While often addressing the problem of error type
selection directly, previous work has dealt with the
more obviously useful task of end to end error detec-
tion and correction. As such, their classification sys-
tems are crippled by poor recall of errors as well as
the lack of information from the corrected sentence
and yield very low accuracies for error detection and
type selection, e.g. Gamon (2011).

Our task is fundamentally different as we assume
the presence of both the original and corrected text.
While the utility of such a system is not as obvi-
ous as full error correction, we note two possible
applications of our technique. The first, mentioned

357



above, is as an analytical tool for language teach-
ers. The second is as a complementary tool for au-
tomated error correction systems themselves. Just
as tools such as BLAST (Stymne, 2011) are useful
in the development of machine translation systems,
our system can produce accurate summaries of the
corrections made by automated systems even if the
systems themselves do not involve such fine grained
error type analysis.

In the following, we describe our experimental
methodology (Section 2) and then discuss the fea-
ture set we employ for classification (Section 3) and
its performance. Next, we outline our application
(Section 4), its heuristic correction detection strat-
egy and empirical evaluation. We finish by dis-
cussing the implications for real world systems (Sec-
tion 5) and avenues for improvement.

2 Methodology

Sentences in the CLC contain one or more error cor-
rections, each of which is labeled with one of 75
error types (Nicholls, 2003). Error types include
countability errors, verb tense errors, word order er-
rors, etc. and are often predicated on the part of
speech involved. For example, the category AG
(agreement) is augmented to form AGN (agreement
of a noun) to tag an error such as “here are some
of my opinion”. For ease of analysis and due to
the high accuracy of state-of-the-art POS tagging,
in addition to the full 75 class problem we also
perform experiments using a compressed set of 15
classes. This compressed set removes the part of
speech components of the error types as shown in
Figure 1.

We create a dataset of corrections from the CLC
by extracting sentence pairs (x, y) where x is the
original (student’s) sentence and y is its corrected
form by the teacher. We create multiple instances
out of sentence pairs that contain multiple correc-
tions. For example, consider the sentence “With this
letter I would ask you if you wuld change it”. This
consists of two errors: “ask” should be replaced with
“like to ask” and “wuld” is misspelled. These are
marked separately in the CLC, and imply the cor-
rected sentence “With this letter I would like to ask
you if you would change it”. Here we extract two
instances consisting of “With this letter I would ask

you if you would change it” and “With this letter I
would like to ask if you wuld change it”, each paired
with the fully corrected sentence. As each correc-
tion in the CLC is tagged with an error type t, we
then form a dataset of triples (x, y, t). This yields
45080 such instances. We use these data in cross-
validation experiments with the feature based Max-
Ent classifier in the Mallet (McCallum, 2002) soft-
ware package.

3 Feature Set

We use the minimum unweighted edit distance path
between x and y as a source of features. The edit dis-
tance operations that compose the path are Delete,
Insert, Substitute, and Equal. To illustrate, the op-
erations we would get from the sentences above
would be (Insert, “like”), (Insert, “to”), (Substitute,
“wuld”, “would”), and (Equal, w, w) for all other
words w.

Our feature set consists of three main categories
and a global category (See Figure 2). For each edit
distance operation other than Equal we use an indi-
cator feature, as well as word+operation indicators,
for example “the word w was inserted” or “the word
w1 was substituted with w2”. The POS Context fea-
tures encode the part of speech context of the edit,
recording the parts of speech immediately preced-
ing and following the edit in the corrected sentence.
For all POS based features we use only tags from the
corrected sentence y, as our tags are obtained auto-
matically.

For a substitution of w2 for w1 we use several
targeted features. Many of these are self explana-
tory and can be calculated easily without outside li-
braries. The In Dictionary? feature is indexed by
two binary values corresponding to the presence of
the words in the WordNet dictionary. For the Same
Stem? feature we use the stemmer provided in the
freely downloadable JWI (Java Wordnet Interface)
library. If the two words have the same stem then
we also trigger the Suffixes feature, which is in-
dexed by the two suffix strings after the stem has
been removed. For global features, we record the
total number of non-Equal edits as well as a feature
which fires if one sentence is a word-reordering of
the other.

3.1 Evaluation

We perform five-fold cross-validation and achieve
a classification accuracy of 88.9% for the 15 class
problem and 83.8% for the full 75 class problem.
The accuracies of the most common class base-
lines are 33.3% and 7.8% respectively. The most
common confusion in the 15 class case is between
D (Derivation), R (Replacement) and S (Spelling).
These are mainly due to context-sensitive spelling
corrections falling into the Replace category or noise
in the mark-up of derivation errors. For the 75 class
case the most common confusion is between agree-
ment of noun (AGN) and form of noun (FN). This is
unsurprising as we do not incorporate long distance
features which would encode agreement.

To check against over-fitting we performed an ex-
periment where we take away the strongly lexical-
ized features (such as “word w is inserted”) and
observed a reduction from 88.9% to 82.4% for 15
class classification accuracy. The lack of a dramatic
reduction demonstrates the generalization power of

our feature templates.

4 An Educational Application

As mentioned earlier, we incorporate our classifier
in an educational software tool. The input to this
tool is a group of aligned sentence pairs from orig-
inal and teacher edited versions of a set of essays.
This tool has two components devoted to (1) isola-
tion of individual corrections in a sentence pair, and
(2) classification of these corrections. This software
could be easily integrated in real world curriculum
as it is natural for the teacher to produce corrected
versions of student essays without stopping to label
and analyze distribution of correction types.

We devise a family of heuristic strategies to
separate independent corrections from one another.
Heuristic hi allows at most i consecutive Equal edit
distance operations in a single correction. This im-
plies that hn+1 would tend to merge more non-
Equal edits than hn. We experimented with i ∈
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. For comparison we also implemented

a heuristic h∗ that treats every non-Equal edit as
an individual correction. This is different than h0,
which would merge edits that do not have an in-
tervening Equal operation. F-scores (using 5 fold
cross-validation) obtained by different heuristics are
reported in Figure 3 for the 15 and 75 class prob-
lems. For these F-scores we attempt to predict both
the boundaries and the labels of the corrections. The
unlabeled F-score (shown as a line) evaluates the
heuristic itself and provides an upper bound for the
labeled F-score of the overall application. We see
that the best upper bound and F-scores are achieved
with heuristic h0 which merges consecutive non-
Equal edits.

5 Future Work

There are several directions in which this work could
be extended. The most obvious is to replace the
correction detection heuristic with a more robust al-
gorithm. Our log-linear classifier is perhaps better
suited for this task than other discriminative clas-
sifiers as it can be extended in a larger framework
which maximizes the joint probability of all correc-
tions. Our work shows that h0 will provide a strong
baseline for such experiments.

and 75 class cases respectively. The line shows the unla-
beled F-score upper bound.

While our classification accuracies are quite good,
error analysis reveals that we lack the ability to
capture long range lexical dependencies necessary
to recognize many agreement errors. Incorporating
such syntactic information through the use of syn-
chronous grammars such as those used by Yamangil
and Shieber (2010) would likely lead to improved
performance. Furthermore, while in this work we
focus on the ESL motivation, our system could also
be used to aid development of automated correc-
tion systems, as was suggested by BLAST (Stymne,
2011) for machine translation.

Finally, there would be much to be gained by test-
ing our application in real classroom settings. Ev-
ery day, teachers of English correct essays and could
possibly provide us with feedback. Our main con-
cern from such testing would be the determination
of a label set which is appropriate for the teachers’
concerns. We expect that the 15 class case is too
coarse and the 75 class case too fine grained to pro-
vide an effective analysis.
