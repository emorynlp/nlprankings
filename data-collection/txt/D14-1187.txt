Abstract

When Part-of-Speech annotated data is
scarce, e.g. for under-resourced lan-
guages, one can turn to cross-lingual trans-
fer and crawled dictionaries to collect par-
tially supervised data. We cast this prob-
lem in the framework of ambiguous learn-
ing and show how to learn an accurate
history-based model. Experiments on ten
languages show significant improvements
over prior state of the art performance.

1 Introduction

In the past two decades, supervised Machine
Learning techniques have established new perfor-
mance standards for many NLP tasks. Their suc-
cess however crucially depends on the availability
of annotated in-domain data, a not so common sit-
uation. This means that for many application do-
mains and/or less-resourced languages, alternative
ML techniques need to be designed to accommo-
date unannotated or partially annotated data.

Several attempts have recently been made to
mitigate the lack of annotated corpora using par-
allel data pairing a (source) text in a resource-rich
language with its counterpart in a less-resourced
language. By transferring labels from the source
to the target, it becomes possible to obtain noisy,
yet useful, annotations that can be used to train a
model for the target language in a weakly super-
vised manner. This research trend was initiated
by Yarowsky et al. (2001), who consider the trans-
fer of POS and other syntactic information, and
further developed in (Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev
et al., 2009) for syntactic dependencies, in (Padó
and Lapata, 2009; Kozhevnikov and Titov, 2013;
van der Plas et al., 2014) for semantic role la-
beling and in (Kim et al., 2012) for named-entity
recognition, to name a few.

Assuming that labels can actually be projected
across languages, these techniques face the issue

of extending standard supervised techniques with
partial and/or uncertain labels in the presence of
alignment noise. In comparison to the early ap-
proach of Yarowsky et al. (2001) in which POS
are directly transferred, subject to heuristic fil-
tering rules, recent works consider the integra-
tion of softer constraints using expectation regu-
larization techniques (Wang and Manning, 2014),
the combination of alignment-based POS transfer
with additional information sources such as dic-
tionaries (Li et al., 2012; Täckström et al., 2013)
(Section 2), or even the simultaneous use of both
techniques (Ganchev and Das, 2013).

In this paper, we reproduce the weakly super-
vised setting of Täckström et al. (2013). By re-
casting this setting in the framework of ambiguous
learning (Bordes et al., 2010; Cour et al., 2011)
(Section 3), we propose an alternative learning
methodology and show that it improves the state of
the art performance on a large array of languages
(Section 4). Our analysis of the remaining errors
suggests that in cross-lingual settings, improve-
ments of error rates can have multiple causes and
should be looked at with great care (Section 4.2).

2 Projecting Labels across Aligned
Corpora

Projecting POS information across languages re-
lies on a rather strong assumption that morpho-
syntactic categories in the source language can
be directly related to the categories in the tar-
get language, which might not always be war-
ranted (Evans and Levinson, 2009; Broschart,
2009). The universal reduced POS tagset pro-
posed by Petrov et al. (2012) defines an opera-
tional, albeit rather empirical, ground to perform
this mapping. It is made of the following 12 cat-
egories: NOUN (nouns), VERB (verbs), ADJ (ad-

jectives), ADV (adverbs), PRON (pronouns), DET
(determiners and articles), ADP (prepositions and
postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunc-
tions), PRT (particles), ‘.’ (punctuation marks)
and X (a catch-all for other categories). These
labels have been chosen for their stability across
languages and for their usefulness in various mul-
tilingual applications. In the rest of this work, all
annotations are mapped to this universal tagset.

Transfer-based methods have shown to be very
effective, even if projected labels only deliver a
noisy supervision, due to tagging (of the source
language) and other alignment errors (Yarowsky
et al., 2001). While this uncertainty can be ad-
dressed in several ways, recent works have pro-
posed to combine projected labels with monolin-
gual information in order to filter out invalid la-
bel sequences (Das and Petrov, 2011; Täckström
et al., 2013). In this work we follow Täckström et
al. (2013) and use two families of constraints:

Token constraints rely on word alignments to
project labels of source words to target words
through alignment links. Table 1 shows that, de-
pendening on the language, only 50−80% of the
target tokens would benefit from label transfer.

Type constraints rely on a tag dictionary to
define the set of possible tags for each word
type. Type constraints reduce the possible la-
bels for a given word and help filtering out cross-
lingual transfer errors (up to 20%, as shown in Ta-
ble 1). As in (Täckström et al., 2013), we con-
sider two different dictionaries. The first one is
extracted automatically from Wiktionary,1 us-
ing the method of (Li et al., 2012). The second
tag dictionary is built by using for each word the
two most frequently projected POS labels from
the training data.2 In contrast to Täckström et al.

1http://www.wiktionary.org/
2This heuristic is similar to the way Täckström et al.

(2013) we use the intersection3 of the two type
constraints instead of their union. Table 1 shows
the precision and recall of the resulting constraints
on the test data.

These two information sources are merged ac-
cording to the rules of Täckström et al. (2013).
These rules assume that type constraints are more
reliable than token constraints and should take
precedence: by default, a given word is associated
to the set of possible tags licensed type constraints;
additionally, when a POS tag can be projected
through alignment and also satisfies the type con-
straints, then it is actually projected, thereby pro-
viding a full (yet noisy) supervision.

As shown in Table 1, token and type con-
straints complement each other effectively and
greatly reduce label ambiguity. However, the
transfer method sketched above associates each
target word with a set of possible labels, of which
only one is true. This situation is less favorable
than standard supervised learning in which one
unique gold label is available for each occurrence.
We describe in the following section how to learn
from this ambiguous supervision information.

3 Modeling Sequences under Ambiguous
Supervision

We use a history-based model (Black et al., 1992)
with a LaSO-like training method (Daumé and
Marcu, 2005). History-based models reduce struc-
tured prediction to a sequence of multi-class clas-
sification problems. The prediction of a complex
structure (here, a sequence of POS tags) is thus
modeled as a sequential decision problem: at each

(2013) filter the tag distribution with a threshold to build the
projected type constraints.

3If the intersection is empty we use the constraints
from Wiktionary first, if also empty, the projected con-
straints then, and by default the whole tag set.

position in the sequence, a multiclass classifier
is used to make a decision, using features that
describe both the input structure and the history
of past decisions (i.e. the partially annotated se-
quence).

Let x = (xi)
n
i=1 denote the observed sequence

and Y be the set of possible labels (in our case
the 12 universal POS tags). Inference consists in
predicting labels one after the other using, for in-
stance, a linear model:

y∗i = arg max
y∈Y

〈w|φ(x, i, y, hi)〉 (1)

where 〈·|·〉 is the standard dot product operation,
y∗i the predicted label for position i, w the weight
vector, hi = y∗1, ..., y∗i−1 the history of past de-
cisions and φ a joint feature map. Inference can
therefore be seen as a greedy search in the space
of the # {Y}n possible labelings of the input se-
quence. Trading off the global optimality of in-
ference for additional flexibility in the design of
features and long range dependencies between la-
bels has proved useful for many sequence labeling
tasks in NLP (Tsuruoka et al., 2011).

The training procedure, sketched in Algo-
rithm 1, consists in performing inference on each
input sentence and correcting the weight vector
each time a wrong decision is made. Impor-
tantly (Ross and Bagnell, 2010), the history used
during training has to be made of the previous pre-
dicted labels so that the training samples reflect the
fact that the history will be imperfectly known at
test time.

This reduction of sequence labeling to multi-
class classification allows us to learn a sequence
model in an ambiguous setting by building on the
theoretical results of Bordes et al. (2010) and Cour
et al. (2011). The decision about the correctness of
a prediction and the weight updates can be adapted
to the amount of supervision information that is
available.

Full Supervision In a fully supervised setting,
the correct label is known for each word token: a
decision is thus considered wrong when this gold
label is not predicted. In this case, a standard per-
ceptron update is performed:

wt+1 ← wt−φ (x, i, y∗i , hi)+φ (x, i, ŷi, hi) (2)
where y∗i and ŷi are the predicted and the gold la-
bel, respectively. This update is a stochastic gra-
dient step that increases the score of the gold label
while decreasing the score of the predicted label.

Ambiguous Supervision During training, each
observation i is now associated with a set of possi-
ble labels, denoted by Ŷi. In this case, a decision is
considered wrong when the predicted label is not
in Ŷi and the weight vector is updated as follows:

wt+1 ← wt−φ (x, i, y∗i , hi)+
∑

ŷi∈Ŷi
φ (x, i, ŷi, hi)

(3)
Compared to (2), this rule uniformly increases the
scores of all the labels in Ŷi.

It can be shown (Bordes et al., 2010; Cour et
al., 2011), under mild assumptions (namely that
two labels never systematically co-occur in the
supervision information), that the update rule (3)
enables to learn a classifier in an ambiguous set-
ting, as if the gold labels were known. Intuitively,
as long as two labels are not systematically co-
occurring in Ŷ , updates will reinforce the correct
labels more often than the spurious ones; at the
end of training, the highest scoring label should
therefore be the correct one.

Algorithm 1 Training algorithm. In the ambigu-
ous setting, Ŷi contains all possible labels; in the
supervised setting, it only contains the gold label.

MOSES pipeline, using the intersection heuristic
that only retains the most reliable alignment links.

The English side of the bitext is tagged using a
standard linear CRF trained on the Penn Treebank.
Tags are then transferred to the target language us-
ing the procedure described in Section 2. For each
language, we train a tagger using the method de-
scribed in Section 3 with T = 100 000 iterations6

using a feature set similar to the one of Li et al.
(2012) and Täckström et al. (2013). The baseline
system is our reimplementation of the partially
observed CRF model of Täckström et al. (2013).
Evaluation is carried out on the test sets of tree-
banks for which manual gold tags are known. For
Czech and Greek, we use the CoNLL’07 Shared
Task on Dependency Parsing; for Arabic, the Ara-
bic Treebank; and otherwise the data of the Uni-
versal Dependency Treebank Project (McDonald
et al., 2013). Tagging performance is evaluated
with the standard error rate.

4.1 Results

Table 2 summarizes the performance achieved
by our method trained in the ambiguous setting
(HBAL) and by our re-implementation of the
partially supervised CRF baseline. As an upper
bound, we also report the score of our method
when trained in a supervised (HBSL) settings
considering the training part of the various tree-
banks, when it is available.7 For the sake of com-
parison, we also list the best scores of previous
studies. Note, however, that a direct comparison
with these results is not completely fair as these

number of iterations T in Algorithm 1 has no significant
impact.

tron, and achieves results that are similar to those obtained
with standard linear CRF.

systems were not trained and evaluated with the
same exact resources (corpora,8 type constraints,
alignments, etc). Also note that the state-of-the-
art scores have been achieved by different models,
which have been selected based on their scores on
the test set and not on a validation set.9

Experimental results show that HBAL signif-
icantly outperforms, on all considered languages
but one, the partially observed CRF that was
trained and tested in the same setting.

4.2 Discussion

The performance of our new method still falls
short of the performance of a fully supervised POS
tagger: for instance, in Spanish, full supervision
reduces the error rate by a factor of 4. A fine-
grained error analysis shows that many errors of
HBAL directly result from the fact that, contrary
to the fully supervised learner HBSL, our am-
biguous setting suffers from a train/test mismatch,
which has two main consequences. First, the train
and test sets do not follow exactly the same nor-
malization and tokenization conventions, which is
an obvious source of mistakes. Second, and more
importantly, many errors are caused by systematic
differences between the test tags and the super-
vised tags (i.e. the English side of the bitext and
Wiktionary). While some of these differences
are linguistically well-justified and reflect funda-
mental differences in the language structure and
usage, others seem to be merely due to arbitrary
annotation conventions.

For instance, in Greek, proper names are labeled
8The test sets are only the same for Czech, Greek and

Swedish.
9The partially observed CRF is the best model in (Täck-

ström et al., 2013) only for German (de), Greek (el) and
Swedish (sv), and uses only type constraints extracted from
Wiktionary.

either as X (when they refer to a foreigner and are
not transliterated) or as NOUN (in all other cases),
while they are always labeled as NOUN in English.
In French and in Greek, contractions of a prepo-
sition and a determiner such as ‘στο’ (‘σε το’,
meaning ‘to the’) or ‘aux’ (‘à les’ also meaning
‘to the’) are labeled as ADP in the Universal De-
pendency Treebank but as DET in Wiktionary
and are usually aligned with a determiner in the
parallel corpora. In the Penn Treebank, quanti-
fiers like ‘few’ or ‘little’ are generally used in con-
junction with a determiner (‘a few years’, ‘a little
parable’, ...) and labeled as ADJ; the correspond-
ing Spanish constructions lack an article (‘mucho
tempio’, ‘pocos años’, ...) and the quantifiers are
therefore labeled as DET. Capturing such subtle
differences is hardly possible without prior knowl-
edge and specifically tailored features.

This annotation mismatch problem is all the
more important in settings like ours, that rely
on several, independently designed, information
sources, which follow contradictory annotation
conventions and for which the mapping to the uni-
versal tagset is actually error-prone (Zhang et al.,
2012). To illustrate this point, we ran three ad-
ditional experiments to assess the impact of the
train/test mismatch.

We first designed a control experiment in which
the type constraints were manually completed
with the gold labels of the most frequent errors of
HBAL. These errors generally concern function
words and can be assumed to result from system-
atic differences in the annotations rather than pre-
diction errors. For instance, for French the type
constraints for ‘du’, ‘des’, ‘au’ and ‘aux’ were cor-
rected from DET to ADP. The resulting model,
denoted ‘HBAL + matched POS’ in Table 2, sig-
nificantly outperforms HBAL, stressing the diver-
gence in the different annotation conventions.

Additionally, in order to approximate the am-
biguous setting train/test mismatch, we learn two
fully supervised Spanish taggers on the same train-
ing data as HBAL, using two different strategies
to obtain labeled data. We first use HBSL (which
was trained on the treebank) to automatically la-
bel the target side of the parallel corpus. In this
setting, the POS tagger is trained with data from
a different domain, but labeled with the same an-
notation scheme as a the test set. Learning with
this fully supervised data yields an error rate of
4.2% for Spanish, almost twice as much as HBSL,

bringing into light the impact of domain shift. We
then use a generic tagger, FREELING,10 to label
the training data, this time with possible addi-
tional inconsistent annotations. The correspond-
ing error rate for Spanish was 6.1%, to be com-
pared with the 8.2% achieved by HBAL. The last
two control experiments show that many of the re-
maining labeling errors seem to be due to domain
and convention mismatches rather to the trans-
fer/ambiguous setting, as supervised models also
suffer from very similar conditions.

These observations show that the evaluation of
transfer-based methods suffer from several biases.
Their results must therefore be interpreted with
great care.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a novel learning
methodology to learn from ambiguous supervision
information, and used it to train several POS tag-
gers. Using this method, we have been able to
achieve performance that surpasses the best re-
ported results, sometimes by a wide margin. Fur-
ther work will attempt to better analyse these re-
sults, which could be caused by several subtle
differences between HBAL and the baseline sys-
tem. Nonetheless, these experiments confirm that
cross-lingual projection of annotations have the
potential to help in building very efficient POS
taggers with very little monolingual supervision
data. Our analysis of these results also suggests
that, for this task, additional gains might be more
easily obtained by fixing systematic biases intro-
duced by conflicting mappings between tags or
by train/test domain mismatch than by designing
more sophisticated weakly supervised learners.
