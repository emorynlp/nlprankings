Abstract

We study two approaches to the marking of
extra-propositional aspects of statements in
text: the task-independent cue-and-scope rep-
resentation considered in the CoNLL-2010
Shared Task, and the tagged-event representa-
tion applied in several recent event extraction
tasks. Building on shared task resources and
the analyses from state-of-the-art systems rep-
resenting the two broad lines of research, we
identify specific points of mismatch between
the two perspectives and propose ways of ad-
dressing them. We demonstrate the feasibility
of our approach by constructing a method that
uses cue-and-scope analyses together with a
small set of features motivated by data anal-
ysis to predict event negation and speculation.
Evaluation on BioNLP Shared Task 2011 data
indicates the method to outperform the nega-
tion/speculation components of state-of-the-
art event extraction systems.

work are publicly available for research pur-

1 Introduction

Understanding extra-propositional aspects of texts
is key to deeper understanding of statements con-
tained in natural language texts. Extra-propositional
aspects such as the polarity of key statements have
long been acknowledged to be critical for user-
facing applications such as information retrieval
(Friedman et al., 1994; Hersh, 1996). In recogni-
tion of this need, a number of recent information
extraction (IE) resources involving structured repre-
sentations of text statements have explicitly included

some marking of certainty and polarity (LDC, 2005;
Kim et al., 2009; Saur and Pustejovsky, 2009; Kim
et al., 2011a; Thompson et al., 2011).

Although extra-propositional aspects are recog-
nised as important, there is no clear consensus on
how to address their annotation and extraction from
text. Some comparatively early efforts focused on
the detection of negation cue phrases associated with
specific (previously detected) terms through regu-
lar expression-based rules (Chapman et al., 2001).
A number of later efforts identified the scope of
negation cues with phrases in constituency analy-
ses in sentence structure (Huang and Lowe, 2007).
Drawing in part on this work, the BioScope corpus
(Vincze et al., 2008) applied a representation where
both cues and their associated scopes are marked as
contiguous spans of text (Figure 1 bottom). This ap-
proach was also applied in the CoNLL-2010 Shared
Task (Farkas et al., 2010), in which 13 participat-
ing groups proposed approaches for Task 2, which
required the identification of uncertainty cues and
their associated scopes in text. In the following,
we will term this task-independent, linguistically-
motivated approach as the cue-and-scope represen-
tation (please see Vincze et al. (2008) for details re-
garding the representation).

For IE efforts, more task-oriented representations
are commonly applied. In an effort to formalise
and drive research for extracting structured repre-
sentations of statements regarding molecular biol-
ogy, the ongoing series of BioNLP shared tasks
have addressed biomedical Event Extraction (EE)
(Kim et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2011a). The extra-
propositional targets of negation and speculation

breviations for PROTEIN, THEME and NEGATION,
respectively.

of extracted events were already included in the
first task in the series, using a representation where
events can be assigned “flags” to mark them as being
negated, speculated, or both (Figure 1 upper). Due
to space limitations we refer the reader to Kim et al.
(2009) for a detailed explanation of the representa-
tion; similar representations have been applied also
in previous event extraction tasks (LDC, 2005).

There are a number of ways in which task-
oriented, event-based approaches could benefit from
the existing linguistically-oriented cue-and-scope
methods for identifying extra-propositional aspects
of text statements. However, there has been sur-
prisingly little work exploring the combination of
the approaches, and comparatively few methods ad-
dressing the latter task in detail. Only three out
of the 24 participants in the BioNLP Shared Task
2009 submitted results for the non-mandatory nega-
tion/speculation task, and although negation and
speculation were also considered in three main tasks
for the 2011 follow-up event (Kim et al., 2011a),
the trend continued, with only two participants ad-
dressing the negation/speculation aspects of the task.
We are aware of only two studies exploring the rela-
tionship between the cue-and-scope and event-based
representations: in a manual analysis of scope over-
lap with tagged events, Vincze et al. (2011) identi-
fied a number of issues and mismatches in annota-
tion scope and criteria, which may explain in part
the lack of methods combining these two lines of
research. Kilicoglu and Bergler (2010) approached
the problem from the opposite direction and used an
existing EE system to extract cue-and-scope annota-
tions in the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task.

In this work, we take a high-level perspective,

seeking to bridge the linguistically oriented frame-
work and the more application-oriented event frame-
work to overcome the mismatches demonstrated
by Vincze et al. (2011). Specifically, we aim to
determine how cue-and-scope recognition systems
can be used to produce a state-of-the-art nega-
tion/speculation detection system for the EE task.

2 Resources

Several existing resources can support the investiga-
tion of the relationship between the linguistically-
oriented and task-oriented perspectives on nega-
tion/speculation detection. In this study, we make
use of the following resources.

First, we study the three BioNLP 2011 Shared
Task corpora that include annotation for negation
and speculation: the GE, EPI and ID main task cor-
pora (Table 1). Second, we make use of support-
ing analyses provided for these corpora in response
to a call sent by the BioNLP Shared Task organis-
ers to the developers of third-party systems (Stene-
torp et al., 2011). Specifically, we use the output
of the BiographTA NeSp Scope Labeler (here re-
ferred to as CLiPS-NESP) (Morante and Daelemans,
2009; Morante et al., 2010) provided by the Univer-
sity of Antwerp CLiPS center. This system provides
cue-and-scope analyses for negation and speculation
and was demonstrated to have state-of-the-art per-
formance at the relevant CoNLL-2010 Shared Task.
Finally, we make use of the event analyses created
by systems that participated in the BioNLP Shared
Task, made available to the research community for
the majority of the shared task submissions (Pyysalo
et al., 2012). These analyses represent the state-
of-the-art in event extraction and their capability to
detect event structures as well as marking them for
negation and speculation.

The above three resources present us with many
opportunities to relate scope-based annotations to
three highly relevant event-based corpora containing
negation/speculation annotations.

3 Manual Analysis

To gain deeper insight into the data and the chal-
lenges in combining the cue-and-scope and event-
oriented perspectives, we performed a manual anal-
ysis of the corpus annotations using the manually

created BioNLP Shared Task training data event an-
notations, and the automatic annotations created for
this data by the CLiPS-NESP system. The test
data was held out and was not directly examined
at any point of our study. We performed the anal-
ysis specifically on the EPI and ID corpora, as the
GE corpus training set texts overlap with the train-
ing data for the CLiPS-NESP system (BioScope cor-
pus), and results on this data would thus not reflect
the performance of the system on unseen data, and
a comparison of the GE and BioScope gold anno-
tations was previously performed by Vincze et al.
(2011).

The analysis was performed by an experienced
annotator with a doctoral degree in a related field
in biology, who individually examined each of the
events marked as negated and speculated in the
EPI and ID training corpora. For the analysis,
the CLiPS-NESP system output was super-imposed
onto the BioNLP Shared Task event annotations.

The annotator was asked to assign three primary
flags for each event that was marked as negated or
speculated: Covered if the event trigger was covered
by span(s) of the correct type with a correct cue in
the cue-and-span analysis, Not-covered if not Cov-
ered, and Error-in-gold if the negation/speculation
flag on the event annotation was itself incorrect. We

also identified a number of additional properties that
initial analysis suggested to frequently characterise
instances where the coverage of the cue-and-scope
system is lacking: Morphological was assigned if
the negation/speculation of an event could be in-
ferred only from the morphology of the word ex-
pressing the event, rather than from cue words in its
context (e.g. unphosphorylated, non-glycosylated);
Hypothesis for cases where speculation is marked
for events stated as hyphotheses1 under consider-
ation, e.g. “We analysed the methylation status of
MGMT”; Ellipsis for cases where the modified ex-
pression is elided (e.g. “A was phosphorylated but B
was not”); and Argument-only if the CLiPS-NESP
output had marked the argument of an event as
negated rather than the event trigger (we use argu-
ment in the sense it is used in the BioNLP Shared
Tasks, for example, in Figure 1 upper, the two argu-
ments of the event are “fMimR” and “fimA”).

The results of the analysis are summarised in Ta-
ble 2. We find that that the system shows a clear dif-
ference in coverage depending on the dataset. For
the ID dataset, a majority of the annotations are cov-
ered by the appropriate spans, while only a small mi-
nority are covered for EPI. Instead, the EPI dataset
contains a significant portion of events where extra-
propositional aspects can only be distinguished by
the morphology of the word expressing the event
(all Morphological cases were negation) as well as
events marked as speculated due to being expressed
as hypotheses under study.

The analysis thus identified specific ways in
which the applicability of negation-detection sys-
tems using a span-and-scope representation could be
improved for some tasks.

1While it is arguable whether such cases represent specula-
tion (Vincze et al., 2008), separation from affirmatively made
claims is clearly motivated for many applications.

4 Methods

We next introduce the methods we apply for as-
signing negation and speculation flags to extracted
events.

4.1 Approach
To focus on the extra-propositional aspects of event
extraction, we only consider the assignment of the
negation and speculation flags, not the extraction of
the event structures that these mark. To our knowl-
edge, no previous work studying this subtask in iso-
lation from event extraction exists. Thus, in order to
be able to relate the performance of the methods we
consider to the performance of previously proposed
approaches, it is necessary to base the negation and
speculation detection on an event extraction analy-
sis. For this reason, we construct our methods us-
ing system outputs for systems participating in the
BioNLP Shared Task 2011, in effect creating a nega-
tion/speculation processing stage for a pipeline sys-
tem where the previous stage is the completion of
event analysis without negation/speculation detec-
tion (Figure 2).

Our methods thus take extracted events as input
and attempt to enrich the output with negation and
speculation annotations. This enables us to produce
a general system with the potential to be applied
together with any existing event extraction system.
Additionally, this allows us to directly compare our
system output with that of the negation/speculation
components of previously proposed monolithic sys-
tems by removing the existing negation and spec-
ulation output from submissions including this and
recreating these annotations using our methods.

4.2 Rule-based Methods
The most straightforward way of carrying over in-
formation from scope-based to event-based annota-

tions is to consider any event structure for which the
word or words stating the event (i.e. the event trig-
ger) is within the scope of a negation or speculation
be negated or speculated (respectively). We imple-
mented this simple heuristic as our initial rule-based
method.

One relatively common category of cases where
this heuristic fails that was identified in analysis re-
lates to events that take other events as arguments.
Consider, for example, the case illustrated in Fig-
ure 3. The speculation span is correctly identified as
covering the statement “FimR modulates mfa1 ex-
pression”, and the event expressed through “mod-
ulates” is identified as speculated. However, the
nested event, the expression of mfa1, is not spec-
ulated. To cover this case, we implemented what
we refer to as the root-heuristic, which prevents the
propagation of negation/speculation marking from
scopes to events that are the arguments of another
event contained in the same scope. The second rule-
based method we consider incorporates this addi-
tional heuristic.

Preliminary development set experiments indi-
cated that while the root-heuristic could improve
precision, the performance of the rule-based meth-
ods remained poor, in particular on the EPI dataset.
The results of the manual analysis (Section 3) sug-
gested this to trace in particular to two main issues,
namely differences between annotation criteria be-
tween BioScope and the shared task data (as noted
also by Vincze et al. (2011)) and events which are
negated not by external cues but by morphological
alternations of the event trigger, such as “unphos-
phorylated” expressing the absence of phosphory-
lation. As it would have been difficult to system-
atically incorporate both morphology and context
into the rule-based method without compromising
the generality of the approach, we opted to move to a
machine learning framework for further method de-
velopment. This allows us to continue to make use
of the existing cue-and-scope annotations while ex-
ploring the effects of other aspects of the text and
maintaining generality through retraining.

4.3 Machine Learning-based Methods

In developing a machine learning-based approach to
the negation/speculation task, we aimed to identify
and evaluate a minimal set of features directly mo-

Table 3: Machine learning features. The fea-
tures are categorised into three groups: features
based on cue-and-scope based heuristics (top), non-
contextual features derived from the event trigger
(middle), and features derived from the context of
the event trigger (bottom). These three feature sets
are abbreviated as E, M and C, respectively.

by a dashed border).

tivated by the analysis of the data and to use the
cue-and-scope analyses as much as possible. In par-
ticular, we wanted to avoid features requiring com-
putationally expensive analyses such as full pars-
ing or replicating the type of analyses performed by
the CLiPS-NESP system, focusing rather on specific
points where its output does not meet the needs of
the event-based approach.

We introduced features representing the heuristics
described in Section 4.2, marking each case as be-
ing either a root or non-root event in its scope (if
any). Drawing further on the cue-and-scope analy-
sis, we included as features the cue word and bag-of-
words features for all tokens in the scope (using sim-
ple white-space tokenisation). To address the issues
identified in manual analysis, we introduced features
for the event trigger text as well as character-based
prefixes of lengths 2 to 7 of the, intended primarily
to capture morphological negation.

All features presented above are derived only

from those parts of the sentence already marked ei-
ther by the event extraction or the cue-and-scope
system. However, due to the differences in anno-
tation guidelines for speculation annotations, we ex-
pect that the scope-based system will fail to mark
a significant portion of the speculation annotations.
To allow the system to learn to detect these, we in-
troduce a minimal set of contextual features, limited
to a bag-of-words representation of the three words
preceding and following the event trigger.

5 Experiments

We perform two sets of experiments, the first to eval-
uate our approach on gold annotations to give a fair
upper-limit to how well our negation/speculation de-
tection system could perform under ideal settings,
and the second to enrich the output of an event ex-
traction system with negation and speculation an-
notations, to evaluate real-world performance and
to allow direct comparison of our methods with
those incorporated in monolithic event extraction
and negation/speculation detection systems.

5.1 Corpora

For our experiments we used the GE, EPI and ID
corpora of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (Table 1).
We note that while the GE training set texts overlap
with the BioScope corpus used to train the CLiPS-
NESP system, the GE test set does not, and thus test
set results are not expected to be overfit.

We noted when performing development set
experiments that training machine learning-based
methods on the negation/speculation annotations of
the event-annotated corpora was problematic due to
the sparseness of these flags in the annotation. To
address this issue, we merge the training data of the
three corpora in all experiments with machine learn-
ing methods.

5.2 Baseline methods

We use the event analyses created by the UTurku
(Björne and Salakoski, 2011) and UConcordia (Kil-
icoglu and Bergler, 2011) systems for the BioNLP
2011, the only systems that included negation and
speculation analyses. To investigate the impact on a
system that did not include a negation/speculation
component, we further consider analyses created

by the FAUST system, which achieved the high-
est performance at two of the three tasks consid-
ered (Riedel et al., 2011). The UTurku system is
a pipeline ML-based EE system, while the UCon-
cordia system is strictly rule-based. FAUST is an
ML-based model combination system incorporating
information from the parser-based Stanford system
(McClosky et al., 2011) and the jointly-modelled
UMass system (Riedel and McCallum, 2011).

We also performed preliminary experiments for
the other released submissions to the BioNLP 2011
Shared Task, but due to space limitations focus only
on the three above-mentioned systems.

5.3 Evaluation criteria

We use the primary evaluation criteria of the
BioNLP 2011 Shared Task (Kim et al., 2011a) to
assure comparability, reporting all results using the
standard precision, recall and their harmonic mean
(F-score).

5.4 Methods

We apply the rule-based simple heuristic method
and its root extension (Section 4.2) as well as Sup-
port Vector Machines (SVM) trained with the fea-
tures introduced in Section 4.3. For the SVM, we
separately evaluate models based on all permuta-
tions of the feature sets introduced in Table 3. In the

results tables we abbreviate the feature set names as
done in Table 3 and use H for the heuristic method
and R for its root extension. As our machine learn-
ing component we use LIBLINEAR (Fan et al.,
2008) with a L2-regularised L2-loss SVM model.
We optimise the SVM regularisation parameter C
using 10-fold cross-validation on the training data.

We use the training, development and test set par-
tition provided by the shared task organisers. In line
with standard ML methodology the test set was held
out during development and was only used when
carrying out the final experiments prior to submit-
ting the manuscript.

6 Results and Discussion

Our initial experiments, building on gold event data
(Tables 4 and 5), support our manual analysis, show-
ing nearly uniform performance improvement with
additional features. First, we find that the root-
heuristic gives an improvement over the original
heuristic in four out of six cases. To justify our us-
age of the cue-and-scope based heuristic feature (E)
we find that adding it as a feature improves on the M
feature set and the MC feature set, showing that even
given context, the cue-and-scope perspective is still
useful. The only anomaly is for speculation on the
EPI dataset, where adding this heuristic feature ac-
tually hampers performance, possibly relating to the

sparseness of useful annotations due to the differing
annotation guidelines, as noted in manual analysis.
The numbers from these initial experiments serve as
an upper bound when we proceed to our enrichment
experiments, as they do not suffer from the possibil-
ity of producing false positives negation/speculation
annotations for false positive event structures.

In addition to the above in preliminary experi-
ments we also considered two features inspired by
findings made by Vincze et al. (2011). A distance-
based feature, measuring the distance in tokens be-
tween the cue-word and the event trigger, and also
trigger suffixes to capture some cases of morpholog-
ical speculation (“induced” vs. “inducible”). How-
ever, we failed to establish any consistent benefits
from these features and only for the EPI dataset did
the suffix features improve performance.

annotations to events predicted by an up-stream EE
system.

tion/speculation flags to the output of event extrac-
tion systems (Tables 6 and 7), our results are some-
what more modest. For negation we see an improve-
ment in four out of six cases, and for speculation in
two out of six. Despite the fact that a major limi-
tation to our approach are the false positive events
that are propagated from the original EE system, we
manage to improve the global score for all data sets
where a global score is provided by the organisers
(Table 8). We improve a full point in F-score for
UTurku on EPI, but only sub-percentage for Faust
on ID, the latter most likely since ID contains fewer
negation and speculation annotations and the global
scores are microaverages over all annotations.

As a final analysis we estimate the upper-bound
in F-score performance for all three EE systems
(Table 9). We do so by assuming that the recall
for events marked by negation and speculation is

53



equal to that of the overall recall of the up-stream
EE system and that negation/speculation annotations
assigned by an oracle. What we can see is that
there is still room for improvement, both for our
enrichment approach and for the EE system’s inter-
nal negation/speculation components, although re-
call of the EE output is a limiting factor we can
expect further efforts towards improving the extra-
propositional aspects of the system to yield perfor-
mance improvements.

7 Conclusions and Future Work

In this study, we have considered two broad lines
of research on extra-propositional aspects of key
statements in text, one using the task-independent,
linguistically-motivated cue-and-scope representa-
tion applied in the recent CoNLL-2010 Shared Task,
and the other using the task-oriented flagged-event
representation applied e.g. in the ACE and BioNLP
Shared Task evaluations. We presented a detailed
manual analysis exploring points of disagreement
and evaluated in detail rule-based and machine
learning-based methods joining state-of-the-art sys-
tems representing the two approaches.

Our manual analysis identified a number of phe-
nomena that limit the applicability of existing cue-
and-scope based systems to the event extraction
task, such as negation expressed through morpho-
logical change of words expressing events (e.g. un-
phosphorylated). To address these issues, we pro-
posed a combination of heuristics and simple lexical
features, carefully selected to address differences in
perspective between the cue-and-scope and event-
based frameworks and aiming to complement cue-
and-scope analyses for creating task-oriented out-
puts.

To test our approach, we created a method suit-
able for use as a component of an event extraction
pipeline that incorporates information from a previ-
ously proposed state-of-the-art cue-and-scope based
negation/speculation detection system and a mini-
mal set of features in an SVM-based system that was
shown to enhance and in several cases improve upon
the output of existing EE systems. Experiments on
the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 EPI and ID datasets
demonstrated that the combined approach could im-
prove the results of the best-performing systems at

the original task in 5 out of 6 cases, outperforming
the highest results reported for any system for these
two tasks.

There exist several potential targets for future
work on improving our introduced system and
to join cue-and-scope and event-based approaches.
Since none of the existing EE corpora was con-
structed with the aim to solely cover negation and
speculation annotations and taking into account our
finding that merging datasets to compensate for data
sparseness is beneficial, it might be worth consid-
ering other possible corpora or resources and how
they can be used for training our machine learning
system.

Also, it would be worthwhile to attempt to com-
bine an existing EE system capable of detect-
ing negation/speculation with our proposed method.
Combining the two could yield an ensemble, im-
proving upon an already strong system by bridging
the differences in perspectives and tapping into the
potential benefits of both approaches.
