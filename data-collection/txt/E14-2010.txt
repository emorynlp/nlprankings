Abstract

We present a multimodal in-vehicle dia-
logue system which uses learned predic-
tions of user answers to enable shorter,
more efficient, and thus safer natural lan-
guage dialogues.

1 Background

1.1 Driver Distraction

Driver distraction is a common cause of accidents,
and is often caused by the driver interacting with
technologies such as mobile phones, media play-
ers or navigation systems. A study, commonly
referred to as the “100 car study” (Neale et al.,
2005) revealed that secondary task distraction is
the largest cause of driver inattention, and that the
handling of wireless devices is the most common
secondary task.

As interaction complexity in the car increases
due to more advanced infotainment systems and
smartphones, drivers are often executing several
tasks in parallel to the primary task of driving.
The increased functionality of these systems has
resulted in large hierarchical information architec-
tures that prolong interaction time, thereby nega-
tively affecting safety as well as user experience
(Kern and Schmidt, 2009).

1.2 Relation to state of the art

State-of-the-art infotainment systems typically do
not include user models at all. Siri, available on
the Apple iPhone 4S and later models, has a static
user model containing personal information ex-
plicitly provided by the user (home address, etc.).
This information is used in voice interactions; for
example, given that the user has entered their fam-
ily relations, phrases like “Call my wife” can be
used. A different approach is taken in Google
Now, which dynamically learns user patterns from

observations and presents unrequested informa-
tion as “cards” on the screen. However, Google
Now does not attempt to integrate predictions into
dialogue interaction.

The work reported here explores the use of
adaptive user modeling in multimodal dialogue
systems. User preferences and behaviour patterns
are learnt from observations of user interactions
with the infotainment system and the context in
which these interactions take place, and are used
proactively to predict user answers and thereby en-
able shorter and more efficient interaction. The
underlying motivating assumption is that using
apps and services in an in-vehicle context inher-
ently leads to distraction, and that reducing inter-
action time will reduce driver distraction.

1.3 TDM

Based on Larsson (2002) and later work, Talka-
matic AB has developed the Talkamatic Dialogue
Manager (TDM).

TDM provides a general interaction model
based on interaction which are basic to human-
human linguistic interaction, resulting in a high
degree of naturalness and flexibility which in-
creases usability. The model is domain-
independent which means that dialogue behaviour
can be altered without touching application prop-
erties and vice versa. TDM also offers integrated
multi-modality which allows user to freely switch
between modalities (Larsson et al., 2011).

1.4 Grounding in TDM

Grounding (Clark and Brennan, 1990) is, roughly,
the process of making sure that dialogue partici-
pants agree on what has been said so far and what
it meant. TDM has an extensive model of ground-
ing (Larsson, 2002). It operates on different levels:

• Perception
• Semantic Understanding

37



• Pragmatic Understanding
• Acceptance
System feedback (positive, negative and in

some cases interrogative) can be generated on each
level:

• Examples: “I didn’t hear” – negative percep-
tion

• “To work, is that right?” – interrogative se-
mantic understanding

• “OK” – positive acceptance.
2 Learning and Classification

Many dialogue applications require the user to an-
swer a number of questions. To make dialogue
shorter, we have extended TDM so that it tries to
predict user answers on the basis of a user model
learned from observations of user behaviour. As
an illustration, we use a road information appli-
cation which tries to predict the user’s destina-
tion and thereby eliminate the need to ask the user
about this.

2.1 Learning Method
Initially, a range of learning methods requir-
ing (N-gram, MDP, POMDP) were explored and
evaluated, but the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
(Mitchell, 1997) was considered the best method.
An important advantage is that KNN can learn
from a relatively small set of observations. This
is in contrast to the MDP and POMDP (and to
a lesser extent, N-gram) methods, which require
large amounts of data to generate useful behaviour.
A potential drawback of KNN is that this model
cannot model sequences of user behaviours.

2.2 Parameter Selection
On the basis of user studies provided from the
user partner of the project, it was decided that the
most important user model parameters was posi-
tion, day of the week and hour of the day. The
training data were simulated and correspond to the
behaviour of an archetypal persona provided by
the user partner in the project.

2.3 Learning and Classification
The learning part of the system listens for a num-
ber of events, such as “start-car”, “stop-car” etc..
From these events and information about cur-
rent position, the time of the day and the day of

the week, the system creates new data instances.
The system thus learns how the user’s destination
varies depending on these parameters. A sample
dataset is shown in Figure 1, where data points
show destinations of trips initiated at various times
of the week.

When the dialogue manager requests a predic-
tion of the destination, the KNN algorithm tries to
find the K data points closest to the present data
point, and the top alternatives are returned to the
dialogue manager together with confidence scores
indicating the reliability of the predictions.

3 Integration of Classifications into TDM

3.1 Grounding uncertain information
We treat the information emanating from the user
model as uncertain information about a (predicted)
user utterance. Hence, the same mechanisms used
for grounding utterances have been adapted for in-
tegrating user model data.

3.2 Integrating Classifier Output
TDM is based on the Information State Update
(ISU) approach to dialogue management. The in-
formation state in TDM is based on that of the
system described in Larsson (2002) and includes
Questions Under Discussion, a dialogue plan, and
shared commitments.

The rule for integrating the user model data is
a standard ISU rule, consisting of preconditions
and effects on the information state. We describe
these informally below:

PRECONDITIONS

• If there is a propositional answer from the
user model resolving a question in the current
plan...

• and if the confidence score reported from the
user model is sufficient, then...

EFFECTS

• accept the propositional answer (include it
into the shared commitments), and...

• give appropriate feedback to the user depend-
ing on the confidence score:

• High confidence⇒ embedded feedback
– “Which route do you want to take to

work?”.

38



Figure 1: A sample dataset. The horizontal axis shows days of the week (0=Monday, ..., 6=Sunday)
and the vertical axis shows hour of the day. Data points show destinations of trips initiated at the time
indicated by their position. (“Now” is the current time, in this case Thursday at lunchtime.)

– The user can always reject the prediction
by requesting another destination.

• Medium confidence⇒ positive feedback
– “I assume you’re going to work”.
– If the user says “no”, the answer is re-

jected
– Silence is interpreted as acceptance.

• Low confidence⇒ interrogative feedback
– “To work, is that correct?”
– In this case, the user needs to explicitly

accept the proposed answer.
– Otherwise, the user is prompted for an

answer.

3.3 GUI output
If the ISU rule above does not apply because of
too low confidence scores, user model informa-
tion is still used in the GUI. When a Wh-question
is raised by the system, the GUI always presents a
list of possible alternatives. High-confidence alter-
natives are highlighted and sorted before the other
alternatives in the list.

4 Resulting behaviour

The demonstrator enables interaction with a learn-
ing dialogue system which uses predictions to sim-

plify interactions. Here is an sample interaction:

User: Traffic information
Car: Ok. What road?
User: E6.
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

If this is repeated on a number of occasions,
eventually the system will use a prediction:

User: Traffic information
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

The system thus reduces the need for repetitive
and information-scarce utterances from the user.
As soon as the system has started identifying a pat-
tern, it will start to suggest the most probable al-
ternatives. Initially, the most probable answers are
presented to the user as the top items in a list. The
alternatives are also marked in a different color to
make them more visible to the user (not shown
here).

User: Traffic information
Car: Ok. What road?
Car GUI: [E6] [E45] [E20] [155]
User: E6.
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

39



After some further use, the system has identi-
fied a pattern which is prominent enough for the
system to make a suggestion:

User: Traffic information
Car: E6, is that right?
User: Yes.
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

After getting further support for its hypothesis,
the system will merely inform the user that an as-
sumption has been made. If the user is satisfied
with the assumption, she does not need to do any-
thing, but can correct or confirm it if desired.

User: Traffic information
Car: I assume E6.
User: [silence]
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

User: Traffic information
Car: I assume E6.
User: No, E45.
Car: Showing traffic on the E45

If the user rejects the system suggestion with-
out giving another answer, the system will show
a menu where the most probable choices are the
topmost ones, and marked in a distinct colour (not
shown here).

User: Traffic information
Car: I assume E6.
User: No.
Car: What road?
Car GUI: [E6] [E45] [E20] [155]

When the system is certain about its hypothe-
sis, the system will simply provide the user with
the desired information without asking the user for
parameters.

User: Traffic information
Car: Showing traffic on the E6

5 Conclusions and further work

We have designed and implemented a mechanism
which learns user patterns and uses them proac-
tively to simplify and shorten dialogue interac-
tions. The idea of learning user patterns from ob-
servations is similar to Google Now. However,

while Google Now uses “cards” to provide un-
requested information to the user, we show how
predictions can be integrated into spoken or multi-
modal dialogue.

It remains for future work to evaluate the sys-
tem to establish that this actually reduces the dis-
traction rate of drivers. We also want to test the
performance of the learning mechanism by train-
ing it on real observations of user behaviours (as
opposed to simulated data).

The current mechanism only predicts answers
to individual system questions, which may result
in suboptimal behaviour in cases where there are
dependencies between the questions pertaining to
some task. An interesting area for future work is
to instead predict sequences of answers; however,
this would require a more powerful learning and
classification mechanisms.
