Abstract
In this paper we address the problem
of multilingual part-of-speech tagging for
resource-poor languages. We use par-
allel data to transfer part-of-speech in-
formation from resource-rich to resource-
poor languages. Additionally, we use a
small amount of annotated data to learn to
“correct” errors from projected approach
such as tagset mismatch between lan-
guages, achieving state-of-the-art perfor-
mance (91.3%) across 8 languages. Our
approach is based on modest data require-
ments, and uses minimum divergence clas-
sification. For situations where no uni-
versal tagset mapping is available, we
propose an alternate method, resulting
in state-of-the-art 85.6% accuracy on the
resource-poor language Malagasy.

1 Introduction

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a crucial task for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, provid-
ing basic information about syntax. Supervised
POS tagging has achieved great success, reach-
ing as high as 95% accuracy for many languages
(Petrov et al., 2012). However, supervised tech-
niques need manually annotated data, and this
is either lacking or limited in most resource-
poor languages. Fully unsupervised POS tagging
is not yet useful in practice due to low accu-
racy (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010). In this pa-
per, we propose a semi-supervised method to nar-
row the gap between supervised and unsupervised
approaches. We demonstrate that even a small
amount of supervised data leads to substantial im-
provement.

Our method is motivated by the availability of
parallel data. Thanks to the development of mul-
tilingual documents from government projects,
book translations, multilingual websites, and so

forth, parallel data between resource-rich and
resource-poor languages is relatively easy to ac-
quire. This parallel data provides the bridge that
permits us to transfer POS information from a
resource-rich to a resource-poor language.

Systems that make use of cross-lingual tag
projection typically face several issues, includ-
ing mismatches between the tagsets used for the
languages, artifacts from noisy alignments and
cross-lingual syntactic divergence. Our approach
compensates for these issues by training on a
small amount of annotated data on the target side,
demonstrating that only 1k tokens of annotated
data is sufficient to improve performance.

We first tag the resource-rich language using a
supervised POS tagger. We then project POS tags
from the resource-rich language to the resource-
poor language using parallel word alignments.
The projected labels are noisy, and so we use
various heuristics to select only “good” training
examples. We train the model in two stages.
First, we build a maximum entropy classifier T
on the (noisy) projected data. Next, we train
a supervised classifier P on a small amount of
annotated data (1,000 tokens) in the target lan-
guage, using a minimum divergence technique
to incorporate the first model, T . Compared
with the state of the art (Täckström et al., 2013),
we make more-realistic assumptions (e.g. relying
on a tiny amount of annotated data rather than
a huge crowd-sourced dictionary) and use less
parallel data, yet achieve a better overall result.
We achieved 91.3% average accuracy over 8 lan-
guages, exceeding Täckström et al. (2013)’s result
of 88.8%.

The test data we employ makes use of map-
pings from language-specific POS tag inventories
to a universal tagset (Petrov et al., 2012). How-
ever, such a mapping might not be available for
resource-poor languages. Therefore, we also pro-
pose a variant of our method which removes the



need for identical tagsets between the projection
model T and the correction model P , based on
a two-output maximum entropy model over tag
pairs. Evaluating on the resource-poor language
Malagasy, we achieved 85.6% accuracy, exceed-
ing the state-of-the-art of 81.2% (Garrette et al.,
2013).

2 Background and Related Work

There is a wealth of prior work on multilingual
POS tagging. The simplest approach takes advan-
tage of the typological similarities that exist be-
tween languages pairs such as Czech and Russian,
or Serbian and Croatian. They build the tagger
— or estimate part of the tagger — on one lan-
guage and apply it to the other language (Reddy
and Sharoff, 2011, Hana et al., 2004).

Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) pioneered the use of
parallel data for projecting tag information from
a resource-rich language to a resource-poor lan-
guage. Duong et al. (2013b) used a similar method
on using sentence alignment scores to rank the
goodness of sentences. They trained a seed model
from a small part of the data, then applied this
model to the rest of the data using self-training
with revision.

Das and Petrov (2011) also used parallel data
but additionally exploited graph-based label prop-
agation to expand the coverage of labelled tokens.
Each node in the graph represents a trigram in the
target language. Each edge connects two nodes
which have similar context. Originally, only some
nodes received a label from direct label projection,
and then labels were propagated to the rest of the
graph. They only extracted the dictionary from
the graph because the labels of nodes are noisy.
They used the dictionary as the constraints for a
feature-based HMM tagger (Berg-Kirkpatrick et
al., 2010). Both Duong et al. (2013b) and Das and
Petrov (2011) achieved 83.4% accuracy on the test
set of 8 European languages.

Goldberg et al. (2008) pointed out that, with the
presence of a dictionary, even an incomplete one,
a modest POS tagger can be built using simple
methods such as expectation maximization. This
is because most of the time, words have a very
limited number of possible tags, thus a dictionary
that specifies the allowable tags for a word helps
to restrict the search space. With a gold-standard
dictionary, Das and Petrov (2011) achieved an ac-
curacy of approximately 94% on the same 8 lan-

guages. The effectiveness of a gold-standard dic-
tionary is undeniable, however it is costly to build
one, especially for resource-poor languages. Li et
al. (2012) used the dictionary from Wiktionary,1 a
crowd-sourced dictionary. They scored 84.8% ac-
curacy on the same 8 languages. Currently, Wik-
tionary covers over 170 languages, but the cov-
erage varies substantially between languages and,
unsurprisingly, it is poor for resource-poor lan-
guages. Therefore, relying on Wiktionary is not
effective for building POS taggers for resource-
poor languages.

Täckström et al. (2013) combined both token
information (from direct projected data) and type
constraints (from Wiktionary’s dictionary) to form
the state-of-the-art multilingual tagger. They built
a tag lattice and used these token and type con-
straints to prune it. The remaining paths are the
training data for a CRF tagger. They achieved
88.8% accuracy on the same 8 languages.

Table 1 summarises the performance of the
above models across all 8 languages. Note that
these methods vary in their reliance on external
resources. Duong et al. (2013b) use the least, i.e.
only the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). Das and
Petrov (2011) additionally use the United Nation
Parallel Corpus. Li et al. (2012) didn’t use any par-
allel text but used Wiktionary instead. Täckström
et al. (2013) exploited more parallel data than Das
and Petrov (2011) and also used a dictionary
from Li et al. (2012).

Another approach for resource-poor languages
is based on the availability of a small amount
of annotated data. Garrette et al. (2013) built a
POS tagger for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy. They
didn’t use parallel data but instead exploited four
hours of manual annotation to build∼4,000 tokens
or ∼3,000 word-types of annotated data. These
tokens or word-types were used to build a tag dic-
tionary. They employed label propagation for ex-
panding the coverage of this dictionary in a similar
vein to Das and Petrov (2011). They built train-
ing examples using this dictionary and then trained
the tagger on this data. They achieved 81.9% and
81.2% accuracy for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy
respectively.

The method we propose in this paper is similar
in only using a small amount of annotation. How-
ever, we directly use the annotated data to train
the model rather than using a dictionary. We argue

that with a proper “guide”, we can take advantage
of very limited annotated data.

2.1 Annotated data

Our annotated data mainly comes from CoNLL
shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz
and Marsi, 2006). The language specific tagsets
are mapped into the universal tagset. We will
use this annotated data mainly for evaluation. Ta-
ble 2 shows the size of annotated data for each
language. The 8 languages we are considering
in this experiment are not actually resource-poor
languages. However, running on these 8 lan-
guages makes our system comparable with pre-
viously proposed methods. Nevertheless, we try
to use as few resources as possible, in order to
simulate the situation for resource-poor languages.
Later in Section 6 we adapt the approach for Mala-
gasy, a truly resource-poor language.

2.2 Universal tagset

We employ the universal tagset from (Petrov et
al., 2012) for our experiment. It consists of 12
common tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ (adjective),
ADV (adverb), PRON (pronoun), DET (deter-
miner and article), ADP (preposition and post-
position), CONJ (conjunctions), NUM (numeri-
cal), PRT (particle), PUNC (punctuation) and X
(all other categories including foreign words and
abbreviations). Petrov et al. (2012) provide the
mapping from each language-specific tagset to the
universal tagset.

The idea of using the universal tagset is of great
use in multilingual applications, enabling compar-
ison across languages. However, the mapping is
not always straightforward. Table 2 shows the size
of the annotated data for each language, the num-
ber of tags presented in the data, and the list of
tags that are not matched. We can see that only 8
tags are presented in the annotated data for Dan-
ish, i.e, 4 tags (DET, PRT, PUNC, and NUM) are

missing.2 Thus, a classifier using all 12 tags will
be heavily penalized in the evaluation.

Li et al. (2012) considered this problem and
tried to manually modify the Danish mappings.
Moreover, PRT is not really a universal tag since
it only appears in 3 out of the 8 languages. Plank
et al. (2014) pointed out that PRT often gets con-
fused with ADP even in English. We will later
show that the mapping problem causes substantial
degradation in the performance of a POS tagger
exploiting parallel data. The method we present
here is more target-language oriented: our model
is trained on the target language, in this way, only
relevant information from the source language is
retained. Thus, we automatically correct the map-
ping, and other incompatibilities arising from in-
correct alignments and syntactic divergence be-
tween the source and target languages.

tagger that only uses information from directly

projected data.

3.1 Parallel data
We first collect Europarl data having English as
the source language, an average of 1.85 million
parallel sentences for each of the 8 language pairs.
In terms of parallel data, we use far less data com-
pared with other recent work. Das and Petrov
(2011) used Europarl and the ODS United Na-
tion dataset, while Täckström et al. (2013) addi-
tionally used parallel data crawled from the web.
The amount of parallel data is crucial for align-
ment quality. Since DPM uses alignments to trans-
fer tags from source to target language, the per-
formance of DPM (and other models that exploit
projection) largely depends on the quantity of par-
allel data. The “No LP” model of Das and Petrov
(2011), which only uses directly projected labels
(without label propagation), scored 81.3% for 8
languages. However, using the same model but
with more parallel data, Täckström et al. (2013)
scored 84.9% on the same test set.

3.2 Label projection
We use the standard alignment tool Giza++ (Och
and Ney, 2003) to word align the parallel data. We
employ the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al.,
2003) to tag the English side of the parallel data
and then project the label to the target side. It has
been confirmed in many studies (Täckström et al.,
2013, Das and Petrov, 2011, Toutanova and John-
son, 2008) that directly projected labels are noisy.
Thus we need a method to reduce the noise. We
employ the strategy of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001)
of ranking sentences using a their alignment scores
from IBM model 3.

Firstly, we want to know how noisy the pro-
jected data is. Thus, we use the test data to build
a simple supervised POS tagger using the TnT
tagger (Brants, 2000) which employs a second-
order Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We tag the
projected data and compare the label from direct
projection and from the TnT tagger. The labels
from the TnT Tagger are considered as pseudo-
gold labels. Column “Without Mapping” from Ta-
ble 3 shows the average accuracy for the first n-
sentences (n = 60k, 100k, 200k, 500k) for 8 lan-
guages according to the ranking. Column “Cov-
erage” shows the percentages of projected label
(the other tokens are Null aligned). We can see
that when we select more data, both coverage and
accuracy fall. In other words, using the sentence

alignment score, we can rank sentences with high
coverage and accuracy first. However, even after
ranking, the accuracy of projected labels is less
than 80% demonstrating how noisy the projected
labels are.

Table 3 (column “With Mapping”) additionally
shows the accuracy using simple tagset mapping,
i.e. mapping each tag to the tag it is assigned most
frequently in the test data. For example DET, PRT,
PUNC, NUM, missing from Danish gold data, will
be matched to PRON, X, X, ADJ respectively. This
simple matching yields a ∼ 4% (absolute) im-
provement in average accuracy. This illustrates the
importance of handling tagset mapping carefully.

3.3 The model

In this section, we introduce a maximum entropy
tagger exploiting the projected data. We select the
first 200k sentences from Table 3 for this experi-
ment. This number represents a trade-off between
size and accuracy. More sentences provide more
information but at the cost of noisier data. Duong
et al. (2013b) also used sentence alignment scores
to rank sentences. Their model stabilizes after us-
ing 200k sentences. We conclude that 200k sen-
tences is enough and capture most information
from the parallel data.

We ignore tokens that don’t have labels, which
arise from null alignments and constitute approxi-
mately 14% of the data. The remaining data (∼1.4
million tokens) are used to train a maximum en-
tropy (MaxEnt) model. MaxEnt is one of the
simplest forms of probabilistic classifier, and is
appropriate in this setting due to the incomplete
sequence data. While sequence models such as
HMMs or CRFs can provide more accurate mod-
els of label sequences, they impose a more strin-

L-BFGS which performs gradient ascent to maxi-
mize L. Table 4 shows the features we considered

for building the DPM. We use mkcls, an unsu-
pervised method for word class induction which is
widely used in machine translation (Och, 1999).
We run mkcls to obtain 100 word classes, using
only the target language side of the parallel data.

Table 5 shows the accuracy of the DPM evalu-
ated on 8 languages (“All features model”). DPM
performs poorly on Danish, probably because of
the tagset mapping issue discussed above. The
DPM result of 80.2% accuracy is encouraging,
particularly because the model had no explicit su-
pervision.

To see what features are meaningful for our
model, we remove features in turn and report
the result. The result in Table 5 disagrees with
Täckström et al. (2013) on the word class features.
They reported a gain of approximately 3% (ab-
solute) using the word class. However, it seems
to us that these features are not especially mean-
ingful (at least in the present setting). Possible
reasons for the discrepancy are that they train the
word class model on a massive quantity of exter-
nal monolingual data, or their algorithms for word
clustering are better (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008).
We can see that the most informative features are
Capitalization, Number and Punctuation. This
makes sense because in languages such as Ger-
man, capitalization is a strong indicator of NOUN.
Number and punctuation features ensure that we
classify NUM and PUNCT tags correctly.



4 Correction Model

In this section we incorporate the directly pro-
jected model into a second correction model
trained on a small supervised sample of 1,000 an-
notated tokens. Our DPM model is not very accu-
rate; as we have discussed it makes many errors,
due to invalid or inconsistent tag mappings, noisy
alignments, and cross-linguistic syntactic diver-
gence. However, our aim is to see how effectively
we can exploit the strengths of the DPM model
while correcting for its inadequacies using direct
supervision. We select only 1,000 annotated to-
kens to reflect a low resource scenario. A small
supervised training sample is a more realistic form
of supervision than a tag dictionary (noisy or oth-
erwise). Although used in most prior work, a tag
dictionary for a new language requires significant
manual effort to construct. Garrette and Baldridge
(2013) showed that a 1,000 token dataset could be
collected very cheaply, requiring less than 2 hours
of non-expert time.

Our correction model makes use of a mini-
mum divergence (MD) model (Berger et al., 1996),
a variant of the maximum entropy model which
biases the target distribution to be similar to a
static reference distribution. The method has been
used in several language applications including
machine translation (Foster, 2000) and parsing
(Plank and van Noord, 2008, Johnson and Riezler,
2000). These previous approaches have used var-
ious sources of reference distribution, e.g., incor-
porating information from a simpler model (John-
son and Riezler, 2000) or combining in- and out-
of-domain models (Plank and van Noord, 2008).
Plank and van Noord (2008) concluded that this
method for adding prior knowledge only works
with high quality reference distributions, other-
wise performance suffers.

In contrast to these previous approaches, we
consider the specific setting where both the
learned model and the reference model so =
P (t|w) are both maximum entropy models. In this
case we show that the MD setup can be simplified
to a regularization term, namely a Gaussian prior
with a non-zero mean. We model the classification
probability, P ′(t|w) as the product between a base
model and a maximum entropy classifier,

P ′(t|w) ∝ P (t|w) exp
D∑
j=1

γjfj(w, t)

where here we use the DPM model as base model

P (t|w). Under this setup, where P ′ uses the same
features as P , and both are log-linear models, this
simplifies to

P ′(t|w) ∝ exp

 D∑
j=1

λjfj(w, t) +
D∑
j=1

γjfj(w, t)


∝ exp

D∑
j=1

(λj + γj) fj(w, t) (1)

where the constant of proportionality is Z ′(w) =∑
t exp

∑D
j=1 (λj + γj) fj(w, t). It is clear that

Equation (1) also defines a maximum entropy clas-
sifier, with parameters αj = λj + γj , and conse-
quently this might seem to be a pointless exercise.
The utility of this approach arises from the prior:
MAP training with a zero mean Gaussian prior
over γ is equivalent to a Gaussian prior over the
aggregate weights, αj ∼ N (λj , σ2). This prior
enforces parameter sharing between the two mod-
els by penalising parameter divergence from the
underlying DPM model λ. The resulting training
objective is

Lcorr = logP (t|w, α)− 1
2σ2

D∑
j=1

(αj − λj)2

which can be easily optimised using standard
gradient-based methods, e.g., L-BFGS. The con-
tribution of the regulariser is scaled by the constant
1

2σ2
.

4.1 Regulariser sensitivity

Careful tuning of the regularisation term σ2 is crit-
ical for the correction model, both to limit over-
fitting on the very small training sample of 1,000
tokens, and to control the extent of the influence
of the DPM model over the correction model.
A larger value of σ2 lessens the reliance on the
DPM and allows for more flexible modelling of
the training set, while a small value of σ2 forces
the parameters to be close to the DPM estimates at
the expense of data fit. We expect the best value
to be somewhere between these extremes, and use
line-search to find the optimal value for σ2. For
this purpose, we hold out 100 tokens from the
1,000 instance training set, for use as our devel-
opment set for hyper-parameter selection.

From Figure 1, we can see that the model per-
forms poorly on small values of σ2. This is under-
standable because the small σ2 makes the model

too similar to DPM, which is not very accurate
(80.2%). At the other extreme, if σ2 is large, the
DPM model is ignored, and the correction model
is equivalent with the supervised model (∼ 88%
accuracy). We select the value of σ2 = 70, which
maximizes the accuracy on the development set.

4.2 The model

Using the value of σ2 = 70, we retrain the model
on the whole 1,000-token training set and evalu-
ate the model on the rest of the annotated data.
Table 6 shows the performance of DPM, Super-
vised model, Correction model and the state-of-
the-art model (Täckström et al., 2013). The super-
vised model trains a maximum entropy tagger us-
ing the same features as in Table 4 on this 1000 to-
kens. The only difference between the supervised
model and the correction model is that in the cor-
rection model we additionally incorporate DPM as
the prior.

The supervised model performs surprisingly
well confirming that our features are meaning-
ful in distinguishing between tags. This model
achieves high accuracy on Danish compared with
other languages probably because Danish is eas-
ier to learn since it contains only 8 tags. Despite
the fact that the DPM is not very accurate, the cor-
rection model consistently outperforms the super-
vised model on all considered languages, approx-
imately 4.3% (absolute) better on average. This
shows that our method of incorporating DPM to
the model is efficient and robust.

The correction model performs much bet-
ter than the state-of-the-art for 7 languages but

slightly worse for 1 language. On average we
achieve 91.3% accuracy compared with 88.8%
for the state-of-the-art, an error rate reduction of
22.3%. This is despite using fewer resources and
only modest supervision.

5 Analysis

Tagset mismatch In the correction model, we
implicitly resolve the mismatched tagset issue.
DPM might contain tags that don’t appear in the
target language or generally are errors in the map-
ping. However, when incorporating DPM into the
correction model, only the feature weight of tags
that appear in the target language are retained. In
general, because we don’t explicitly do any map-
ping between languages, we might have trouble if
the tagset size of the target language is bigger than
the source language tagset. However, this is not
the case for our experiment because we choose En-
glish as the source-side and English has the full 12
tags.

Learning curve We investigate the impact of
the number of available annotated tokens on the
correction model. Figure 2 shows the learning
curve of the correction model and the supervised
model. We can clearly see the differences be-
tween 2 models when the size of training data is
small. For example, at 100 tokens, the difference
is very large, approximately 18% (absolute), it is
also 6% (absolute) better than DPM. This differ-
ence diminishes as we add more data. This make
sense because when we add more data, the super-
vised model become stronger, while the effective-

ness of the DPM prior on the correction model is
wearing off. An interesting observation is that the
correction model is always better, even when we
add massive amounts of annotated data. At 50,000
tokens, when the supervised model reaches 96%
accuracy, the correction model is still 0.3% (abso-
lute) better, reaching 96.3%. It means that even
at that high level of confidence, some informa-
tion can still be added from DPM to the correc-
tion model. This improvement probably comes
from the observation that the ambiguity in one
language is explained through the alignment. It
also suggests that this method could improve the
performance of a supervised POS tagger even for
resource-rich languages.

Our methods are also relevant for annotation
projects for resource-poor languages. Assuming
that it is very costly to annotate even 100 tokens,
applying our methods can save annotation effort
but maintain high performance. For example, we
just need 100 tokens to match the accuracy of a su-
pervised method trained on 700 tokens, or we just
need 500 tokens to match the performance with
nearly 2,000 tokens of supervised learning.

Our method is simple, but particularly suitable
for resource-poor languages. We need a small
amount of annotated data for a high performance
POS tagger. For example, we need only around
300 annotated tokens to reach the same accuracy
as the state-of-the-art unsupervised POS tagger
(88.8%).

Tag dictionary Although, it is not our objec-
tive to rely on the dictionary, we are interested
in whether the gains from the correction model
still persist when the DPM performance is im-
proved. We attempt to improve DPM, following
the method of Li et al. (2012) by building a tag dic-
tionary using Wiktionary. This dictionary is then
used as a feature which fires for word-tag pairings

present in the dictionary. We expect that when we
add this additional supervision, the DPM model
should perform better. Table 6 shows the perfor-
mance of DPM and the correction model when in-
corporating the dictionary. The DPM model only
increases 0.6% absolute but the correction model
increases 1.3%. Additionally, it shows that our
model can improve further by incorporating exter-
nal information where available.

CRF Our approach of using simple classifiers
begs the question of whether better results could
be obtained using sequence models, such as con-
ditional random fields (CRFs). As mentioned pre-
viously, a CRF is not well suited for incomplete
data. However, as our second ‘correction’ model
is trained on complete sequences, we now con-
sider using a CRF in this stage. The training al-
gorithm is as follows: first we estimate the DPM
feature weights on the incomplete data as before,
and next we incorporate the feature weights into a
CRF trained on the 1,000 annotated tokens. This is
complicated by the different feature sets between
the MaxEnt classifier and the CRF, however the
classifier uses a strict subset of the CRF features.
Thus, we use the minimum divergence prior for
the token level features, and a standard zero-mean
prior for the sequence features. That is, the ob-
jective function of the CRF correction model be-
comes:

Lcorrcrf = logP (t|w, α)

− 1
2δ21

∑
j∈F1

(αj − λj)2 −
1

2δ22

∑
j∈F2

α2j (2)

where F1 is the set of features referring to only
one label as in the DPM maxent model and F2
is the set of features over label pairs. The union
of F = F1 ∪ F2 is the set of all features for
the CRF. We perform grid search using held out



data as before for δ21 and δ
2
2 . The CRF correc-

tion model scores 88.1% compared with 86.5% of
the supervised CRF model trained on the 1,000
tokens. Clearly, this is beneficial, however, the
CRF correction model still performs worse than
the MaxEnt correction model (91.3%). We are not
sure why but one reason might be overfitting of
the CRF, due to its large feature set and tiny train-
ing sample. Moreover, this CRF approach is or-
thogonal to Täckström et al. (2013): we could use
their CRF model as the DPM model and train the
CRF correction model using the same minimum
divergence method, presumably resulting in even
higher performance.

6 Two-output model

Garrette and Baldridge (2013) also use only a
small amount of annotated data, evaluating on
two resource-poor languages Kinyarwanda (KIN)
and Malagasy (MLG). As a simple baseline, we
trained a maxent supervised classifier on this data,
achieving competitive results of 76.4% and 80.0%
accuracy compared with their published results
of 81.9% and 81.2% for KIN and MLG, respec-
tively. Note that the Garrette and Baldridge (2013)
method is more complicated than this baseline.

We want to further improve the accuracy of
MLG using parallel data. Applying the technique
from Section 4 will not work directly, due to the
tagset mismatch (the Malagasy tagset contains 24
tags) which results in highly different feature sets.
Moreover, we don’t have the language expertise
to manually map the tagset. Thus, in this section,
we propose a method capable of handling tagset
mismatch. For data, we use a parallel English-
Malagasy corpus of ∼100k sentences,4 and the
POS annotated dataset developed by Garrette and
Baldridge (2013), which comprises 4230 tokens
for training and 5300 tokens for testing.

6.1 The model
Traditionally, MaxEnt classifiers are trained us-
ing a single label.5 The method we propose is
trained with pairs of output labels: one for the
Malagasy tag (tM ) and one for the universal tag

4http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/global-voices/
5Or else a sequence of labels, in the case of a conditional

random field (Lafferty et al., 2001). However, even in this
case, each token is usually assigned a single label. An excep-
tion is the factorial CRF (Sutton et al., 2007), which models
several co-dependent sequences. Our approach is equivalent
to a factorial CRF without edges between tags for adjacent
tokens in the input.

(tU ), which are both predicted conditioned on a
Malagasy word (wM ) in context. Our two-output
model is defined as

P (tM , tU |wM ) =
1

Z(wM )

E∑

F∑

(3)

where fM , fU , fB are the feature functions con-
sidering tM only, tU only, and over both outputs
tM and tU respectively, and Z(wM ) is the parti-
tion function. We can think of Eq. (3) as the com-
bination of 3 models: the Malagasy maxent super-
vised model, the DPM model, and the tagset map-
ping model. The central idea behind this model is
to learn to predict not just the MLG tags, as in a
standard supervised model, but also to learn the
mapping between MLG and the noisy projected
universal tags. Framing this as a two output model
allows for information to flow both ways, such that
confident taggings in either space can inform the
other, and accordingly the mapping weights α are
optimised to maximally exploit this effect.

One important question is how to obtain la-
belled data for training the two-output model, as
our small supervised sample of MLG text is only
annotated for MLG labels tM . We resolve this
by first learning the DPM model on the projected
labels, after which we automatically label our
correction training set with predicted tags from
the DPM model. That is, we augment the an-
notated training data from (tM , wM ) to become
(tM , tU , wM ). This is then used to train the two-
output maxent classifier, optimising a MAP ob-
jective using standard gradient descent. Note that
it would be possible to apply the same minimum
divergence technique for the two-output maxent
model. In this case the correction model would
include a regularization term over the λ to bias to-
wards the DPM parameters, while γ and α would
use a zero-mean regularizer. However, we leave
this for future work.

Table 7 summarises the performance of the
state-of-the-art (Garrette et al., 2013), the super-
vised model and the two-output maxent model
evaluated on the Malagasy test set. The two-output
maxent model performs much better than the su-
pervised model, achieving ∼5.3% (absolute) im-
provement. An interesting property of this ap-

proach is that we can use different tagsets for the
DPM. We also tried the original Penn treebank
tagset which is much larger than the universal
tagset (48 vs. 12 tags). We observed a small im-
provement reaching 85.6%, suggesting that some
pertinent information is lost in the universal tagset.
All in all, this is a substantial improvement over
the state-of-the-art result of 81.2% (Garrette et al.,
2013) and an error reduction of 23.4%.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we thoroughly review the work on
multilingual POS tagging of the past decade. We
propose a simple method for building a POS tag-
ger for resource-poor languages by taking advan-
tage of parallel data and a small amount of anno-
tated data. Our method also efficiently resolves
the tagset mismatch issue identified for some lan-
guage pairs. We carefully choose and tune the
model. Comparing with the state-of-the-art, we
are using the more realistic assumption that a
small amount of labelled data can be made avail-
able rather than requiring a crowd-sourced dic-
tionary. We use less parallel data which as we
pointed out in section 3.1, could have been a huge
disadvantage for us. Moreover, we did not exploit
any external monolingual data. Importantly, our
method is simpler but performs better than previ-
ously proposed methods. With only 1,000 anno-
tated tokens, less than 1% of the test data, we can
achieve an average accuracy of 91.3% compared
with 88.8% of the state-of-the-art (error reduction
rate ∼22%). Across the 8 languages we are sub-
stantially better at 7 and slightly worse at one. Our
method is reliable and could even be used to im-
prove the performance of a supervised POS tagger.

Currently, we are building the tagger and eval-
uating through several layers of mapping. Each
layer might introduce some noise which accumu-
lates and leads to a biased model. Moreover,
the tagset mappings are not available for many
resource-poor languages. We therefore also pro-

posed a method to automatically match between
tagsets based on a two-output maximum entropy
model. On the resource-poor language Mala-
gasy, we achieved the accuracy of 85.6% com-
pared with the state-of-the-art of 81.2% (Garrette
et al., 2013). Unlike their method, we additionally
use a small amount of parallel data.

In future work, we would like to improve the
performance of DPM by collecting more parallel
data. Duong et al. (2013a) pointed out that using
a different source language can greatly alter the
performance of the target language POS tagger.
We would like to experiment with different source
languages other than English. We assume that we
have 1,000 tokens for each language. Thus, for the
8 languages we considered we will have 8,000 an-
notated tokens. Currently, we treat each language
independently, however, it might also be interest-
ing to find some way to incorporate information
from multiple languages simultaneously to build
the tagger for a single target language.
