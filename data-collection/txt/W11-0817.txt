Abstract

In this paper, we describe our methods to
detect noun compounds and light verb con-
structions in running texts. For noun com-
pounds, dictionary-based methods and POS-
tagging seem to contribute most to the per-
formance of the system whereas for light
verb constructions, the combination of POS-
tagging, syntactic information and restrictions
on the nominal and verbal component yield
the best result. However, focusing on deverbal
nouns proves to be beneficial for both types
of MWEs. The effect of syntax is negligible
on noun compound detection whereas it is un-
ambiguously helpful for identifying light verb
constructions.

1 Introduction

Multiword expressions are lexical items that can be
decomposed into single words and display idiosyn-
cratic features (Sag et al., 2002; Calzolari et al.,
2002; Kim, 2008). They are frequent in language
use and they usually exhibit unique and idiosyn-
cratic behavior, thus, they often pose a problem to
NLP systems. A compound is a lexical unit that
consists of two or more elements that exist on their
own. Light verb constructions are verb and noun
combinations in which the verb has lost its meaning
to some degree and the noun is used in one of its
original senses (e.g. have a walk or give advice).

In this work, we aim at identifying nominal com-
pounds and light verb constructions by using rule-
based methods. Noun compounds belong to the
most frequent MWE-classes (in the Wikipedia cor-
pus we developed for evaluation (see 3.2), about

75% of the annotated multiword expressions were
noun compounds) and they are productive, i.e. new
nominal compounds are being formed in language
use all the time, which yields that they cannot be
listed exhaustively in a dictionary (as opposed to
e.g. prepositional compounds). Their inner syntactic
structure varies: they can contain nouns, adjectives
and prepositions as well.

Light verb constructions are semi-productive, that
is, new light verb constructions might enter the lan-
guage following some patterns (e.g. give a Skype
call on the basis of give a call). On the other hand,
they are less frequent in language use (only 9.5% of
multiword expressions were light verb constructions
in the Wikipedia database) and they are syntactically
flexible, that is, they can manifest in various forms:
the verb can be inflected, the noun can occur in its
plural form and the noun can be modified. The nom-
inal and the verbal component may not even be ad-
jacent in e.g. passive sentences.

Our goal being to compare how different ap-
proaches perform in the case of the different types
of multiword expressions, we have chosen these two
types of MWEs that are dissimilar in several aspects.

2 Related work

There are several applications developed for identi-
fying MWEs, which can be classified according to
the methods they make use of (Piao et al., 2003).
First, statistical models rely on word frequencies,
co-occurrence data and contextual information in
deciding whether a bigram or trigram (or even an
n-gram) of words can be labeled as a multiword ex-
pression or not. Such systems are used for several

116



languages and several types of multiword expres-
sions, see e.g. Bouma (2010). The advantage of
statistical systems is that they can be easily adapted
to other languages and other types of multiword ex-
pressions, however, they are not able to identify rare
multiword expressions (as Piao et al. (2003) empha-
size, 68% of multiword expressions occur at most
twice in their corpus).

Some hybrid systems make use of both statisti-
cal and linguistic information as well, that is, rules
based on syntactic or semantic regularities are also
incorporated into the system (Evert and Kermes,
2003; Bannard, 2007; Cook et al., 2007; Al-Haj and
Wintner, 2010). This results in better coverage of
multiword expressions. On the other hand, these
methods are highly language-dependent because of
the amount of linguistic rules encoded, thus, it re-
quires much effort to adapt them to different lan-
guages or even to different types of multiword ex-
pressions. However, the combination of different
methods may improve the performance of MWE-
extracting systems (Pecina, 2010).

Several features are used in identifying multi-
word expressions, which are applicable to differ-
ent types of multiword expressions to various de-
grees. Co-occurrence statistics and POS-tags seem
to be useful for all types of multiword expressions,
for instance the tool mwetoolkit (Ramisch et al.,
2010a) makes use of such features, which is illus-
trated through the example of identifying English
compound nouns (Ramisch et al., 2010b).

Caseli et al. (2010) developed an alignment-based
method for extracting multiword expressions from
parallel corpora. This method is also applied to
the pediatrics domain (Caseli et al., 2009). Zarrieß
and Kuhn (2009) argue that multiword expressions
can be reliably detected in parallel corpora by using
dependency-parsed, word-aligned sentences. Sinha
(2009) detects Hindi complex predicates (i.e. a com-
bination of a light verb and a noun, a verb or an ad-
jective) in a Hindi–English parallel corpus by iden-
tifying a mismatch of the Hindi light verb meaning
in the aligned English sentence. Van de Cruys and
Moirón (2007) describe a semantic-based method
for identifying verb-preposition-noun combinations
in Dutch, which relies on selectional preferences for
both the noun and the verb. Cook et al. (2007) dif-
ferentiate between literal and idiomatic usages of

verb and noun constructions in English. They make
use of syntactic fixedness of idioms when develop-
ing their unsupervised method. Bannard (2007) also
seeks to identify verb and noun constructions in En-
glish on the basis of syntactic fixedness. Samardžić
and Merlo (2010) analyze English and German light
verb constructions in parallel corpora. They found
that linguistic features (i.e. the degree of composi-
tionality) and the frequency of the construction both
have an effect on aligning the constructions.

3 Experiments

In order to identify multiword expressions, simple
methods are worth examining, which can serve as a
basis for implementing more complex systems and
can be used as features in machine learning set-
tings. Our aim being to compare the effect of dif-
ferent methods on the identification of noun com-
pounds and light verb constructions, we considered
it important to develop methods for both MWE types
that make use of their characteristics and to adapt
those methods to the other type of MWE – in this
way, the efficacy and the MWE-(in)dependence of
the methods can be empirically evaluated, which can
later have impact on developing statistical MWE-
detectors.

Earlier studies on the detection of light verb con-
structions generally take syntactic information as a
starting point (Cook et al., 2007; Bannard, 2007;
Tan et al., 2006), that is, their goal is to classify verb
+ object constructions selected on the basis of syn-
tactic pattern as literal or idiomatic. However, we
do not aim at classifying LVC candidates filtered by
syntactic patterns but at identifying them in running
text without assuming that syntactic information is
necessarily available. In our investigations, we will
pay distinctive attention to the added value of syn-
tactic features on the system’s performance.

3.1 Methods for MWE identification

For identifying noun compounds, we made use of a
list constructed from the English Wikipedia. Lower-
case n-grams which occurred as links were collected
from Wikipedia articles and the list was automati-
cally filtered in order to delete non-English terms,
named entities and non-nominal compounds etc. In
the case of the method ‘Match’, a noun compound

117



candidate was marked if it occurred in the list. The
second method we applied for noun compounds in-
volved the merge of two possible noun compounds:
if A B and B C both occurred in the list, A B C was
also accepted as a noun compound (‘Merge’). Since
the methodology of dictionary building was not ap-
plicable for collecting light verb constructions (i.e.
they do not function as links in Wikipedia), we could
not apply these two methods to them.

In the case of ‘POS-rules’, a noun compound
candidate was marked if it occurred in the list and
its POS-tag sequence matched one of the previ-
ously defined patterns (e.g. JJ (NN|NNS)). For
light verb constructions, the POS-rule method meant
that each n-gram for which the pre-defined patterns
(e.g. VB.? (NN|NNS)) could be applied was ac-
cepted as light verb constructions. For POS-tagging,
we used the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova and
Manning, 2000). Since the methods to follow rely
on morphological information (i.e. it is required
to know which element is a noun), matching the
POS-rules is a prerequisite to apply those methods
to identify MWEs.

The ‘Suffix’ method exploited the fact that many
nominal components in light verb constructions are
derived from verbs. Thus, in this case only construc-
tions that contained nouns ending in certain deriva-
tional suffixes were allowed and for nominal com-
pounds the last noun had to have this ending.

The ‘Most frequent’ (MF) method relied on the
fact that the most common verbs function typically
as light verbs (e.g. do, make, take, have etc.) Thus,
the 15 most frequent verbs typical of light verb con-
structions were collected and constructions where
the stem of the verbal component was among those
of the most frequent ones were accepted. As for
noun compounds, the 15 most frequent nouns in En-
glish were similarly collected1 and the lemma of the
last member of the possible compound had to be
among them.

The ‘Stem’ method pays attention to the stem of
the noun. In the case of light verb constructions, the
nominal component is typically one that is derived
from a verbal stem (make a decision) or coincides
with a verb (have a walk). In this case, we accepted

1as listed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Most\_common\_words\_in\_English

only candidates that had the nominal component /
the last noun whose stem was of verbal nature, i.e.
coincided with a stem of a verb.

Syntactic information can also be exploited in
identifying MWEs. Typically, the syntactic relation
between the verb and the nominal component in a
light verb construction is dobj or prep – using
Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)). The re-
lation between the members of a typical noun com-
pound is nn or amod in attributive constructions.
The ‘Syntax’ method accepts candidates among
whose members these syntactic relations hold.

We also combined the above methods to identify
noun compounds and light verb constructions in our
databases (the union of candidates yielded by the
methods is denoted by ∪ while the intersection is
denoted by ∩ in the respective tables).

3.2 Results
For the evaluation of our models, we developed a
corpus of 50 Wikipedia articles, in which several
types of multiword expressions (including nomi-
nal compounds and light verb constructions) and
Named Entities were marked. The database contains
2929 occurrences of nominal compounds and 368
occurrences of light verb constructions and can be
downloaded under the Creative Commons licence at
http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/rgai/mwe.

Table 1 shows the results of our experiments.
Methods were evaluated on the token level, i.e. each
occurrence of a light verb construction had to be
identified in text. It can be seen that the best result
for noun compound identification can be obtained
if the three dictionary-based methods are combined.
We also evaluated the method of POS-rules without
taking into account dictionary matches (POS-rules
w/o dic), which result serves as the baseline for com-
paring the effect of LVC-specific methods on noun
compound detection.

As can be seen, by adding any of the LVC-specific
features, the performance of the system declines, i.e.
none of them can beat the baseline. While the fea-
ture ‘Stem’ (and its combinations) improve preci-
sion, recall severely falls back: especially ‘Most fre-
quent noun’ (MFN) has an extremely poor effect on
it. This was expected since the lexical constraint
on the last part of the compound heavily restricts
the scope of the noun compounds available. On the

118



other hand, the 15 most frequent nouns in English
are not derived from verbs hence they do not end in
any of the pre-defined suffixes, thus, the intersection
of the features ‘MFN’ and ‘Suffix’ does not yield
any noun compound (the intersection of all the three
methods also behaves similarly). It must be men-
tioned, however, that the union of all features yields
the best recall as expected and the best F-measure
can be achieved by the union of ‘Suffix’ and ‘Stem’.

The effect of adding syntactic rules to the system
is not unequivocal. In many cases, the improvement
is marginal (it does not exceed 1% except for the
POS-rules w/o dic method) or the performance even
degrades. The latter is most obvious in the case of
the combination of dictionary-based rules, which is
mainly caused by the decline in recall, however, pre-
cision improves. The overall decline in F-score may
thus be related to possible parsing errors.

In the case of light verb constructions, the recall
of the baseline (POS-rules) is high, however, its pre-
cision is low (i.e. not all of the candidates defined
by the POS patterns are light verb constructions).
The ‘Most frequent verb’ (MFV) feature proves to
be the most useful: the verbal component of the light
verb construction is lexically much more restricted
than the noun, which is exploited by this feature.
The other two features put some constraints on the
nominal component, which is typically of verbal na-
ture in light verb constructions: ‘Suffix’ simply re-
quires the noun to end in a given n-gram (without ex-
ploiting further grammatical information) whereas
‘Stem’ allows nouns derived from verbs. When
combining a verbal and a nominal feature, union re-
sults in high recall (the combinations typical verb +
non-deverbal noun or atypical verb + deverbal noun
are also found) while intersection yields high preci-
sion (typical verb + deverbal noun combinations are
found only).

We also evaluated the performance of the ‘Syn-
tax’ method without directly exploiting POS-rules.
Results are shown in Table 2. It is revealed that
the feature dobj is much more effective in identify-
ing light verb constructions than the feature prep,
on the other hand, dobj itself outperforms POS-
rules. If we combine the dobj feature with the
best LVC-specific feature (namely, MFV), we can
achieve an F-measure of 26.46%. The feature dobj
can achieve a recall of 59.51%, which suggests

that about 40% of the nominal components in our
database are not objects of the light verb. Thus, ap-
proaches that focus on only verb-object pairs (Cook
et al., 2007; Bannard, 2007; Tan et al., 2006) fail to
identify a considerable part of light verb construc-
tions found in texts.

The added value of syntax was also investigated
for LVC detection as well. As the results show, syn-
tax clearly helps in identifying LVCs – its overall
effect is to add up to 4% to the F-score. The best
result, again, is yielded by the MFV method, which
is about 30% above the baseline.

4 Discussion

When contrasting results achieved for light verb
constructions and noun compounds, it is revealed
that the dictionary-based method applying POS-
rules yields the best result for noun compounds and
the MFV feature combined with syntactic informa-
tion is the most useful for LVC identification. If
no dictionary matches were taken into consideration,
the combination of the features ‘Suffix’ and ‘Stem’
achieved the best result, however, ‘Stem’ alone can
also perform similarly. Since ‘Stem’ identifies de-
verbal nouns, that is, nouns having an argument
structure, it is not surprising that this feature is valu-
able in noun compound detection because the first
part in the compound is most probably an argument
of the deverbal noun (as in noun compound detection
the object of detection is noun compound, in other
words, we detect noun compounds). Thus, it will be
worth examining how the integration of the ‘Stem’
feature can improve dictionary-based models.

Making use of only POS-rules does not seem to

be satisfactory for LVC detection. However, the
most useful feature for identifying LVCs, namely,
MFV/MFN proves to perform poorly for noun com-
pounds, which can be explained by the fact that the
verbal component of LVCs usually comes from a
well-defined set of frequent verbs, thus, it is lexically
more restricted than the parts of noun compounds.
The feature ’Stem’ helps improve recall and this fea-
ture can be further enhanced since in some cases,
the Porter stemmer did not render the same stem to
derivational pairs such as assumption – assume. For
instance, derivational information encoded in word-
net relations might contribute to performance.

Concerning syntactic information, it has clearly
positive effects on LVC identification, however, this
influence is ambiguous in the case of noun com-
pounds. Since light verb constructions form a syn-
tactic phrase and noun compounds behave syntac-
tically as one unit (having an internal syntactic hi-
erarchy though), this result suggests that for noun
compound detection, POS-tagging provides enough
information while for light verb constructions, syn-
tactic information is expected to improve the system.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we aimed at identifying noun com-
pounds and light verb constructions in running texts

with rule-based methods and compared the effect
of several features on detecting those two types
of multiword expressions. For noun compounds,
dictionary-based methods and POS-tagging seem
to contribute most to the performance of the sys-
tem whereas for light verb constructions, the com-
bination of POS-tagging, syntactic information and
restrictions on the nominal and verbal component
yield the best result. Although the effect of syntax
is negligible on noun compound detection, it is un-
ambiguously helpful for identifying light verb con-
structions. Our methods can be improved by extend-
ing the set and scope of features and refining POS-
and syntactic rules and they can be also adapted to
other languages by creating language-specific POS-
rules, lists of suffixes and light verb candidates.

For higher-level of applications, it is necessary to
know which tokens form one (syntactic or semantic)
unit, thus, we believe that our results in detecting
noun compounds and light verb constructions can be
fruitfully applied in e.g. information extraction or
machine translation as well.
