Abstract
This paper describes experiments in de-
tecting and annotating code-switching in
a large multilingual diachronic corpus of
Swiss Alpine texts. The texts are in En-
glish, French, German, Italian, Romansh
and Swiss German. Because of the mul-
tilingual authors (mountaineers, scientists)
and the assumed multilingual readers, the
texts contain numerous code-switching
elements. When building and annotating
the corpus, we faced issues of language
identification on the sentence and sub-
sentential level. We present our strategy
for language identification and for the an-
notation of foreign language fragments
within sentences. We report 78% precision
on detecting a subset of code-switches
with correct language labels and 92% un-
labeled precision.

1 Introduction

In the Text+Berg project we have digitized the
yearbooks of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from
its first edition in 1864 until today. They contain
articles about mountain expeditions, the flora and
fauna of the Alpes and other mountain regions,
glacier and climate observations, geology and his-
tory papers, book reviews, accident and security
reports, as well as the protocols of the annual
club gatherings. The texts are in the four official
languages of Switzerland French, German, Italian
and Romansh 1 plus a few in English and Swiss
German dialects.

Because of the multilinguality of the authors
and readers, many articles are mixed-language
texts with inter-sentential and intra-sentential

is spoken by around 25,000 people in the mountainous South-
Eastern canton of Graubünden.

code-switching. This poses a challenge for auto-
matically processing the texts. When we apply
Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging, named entity recog-
nition or parsing, our systems need to know the
language that they are dealing with. Therefore we
had used a language identifier from the start of the
project to mark the language of each sentence. We
report on our experiences with sentence-based lan-
guage identification in section 3. Figure 1 shows
an example of a French text with an English ap-
pendix title plus an English quote from this book.

Lately we discovered that our corpus also
contains many intra-sentential code-switches. For
example, we find sentences like

... und ich finde es �very nice and de-
lightful� einen Vortrag halten zu dürfen.
(Die Alpen, 1925) (EN : ... and I find it
very nice and delightful to be allowed to
give a talk.)

where the German sentence contains an English
phrase in quotation marks. Obviously, a German
PoS tagger will produce nonsense tags for the En-
glish phrase as the words will be unknown to it.
PoS taggers are good at tagging single unknown
words based on the surrounding context, but most
taggers fail miserably when a sequence of two
or more words is unknown. The upper half of fi-
gure 2 shows the PoS tagger output for the above
example. The words very, nice, delightful are sen-
selessly tagged as proper names (NE), only and is
tagged as foreign word (FM).

Our goal is to detect all intra-sentential code-
switches and to annotate them as exemplified in
the lower half of figure 2. They shall be framed
with the TEI-conformant tag <foreign> which
also shall specify the language of the foreign lan-
guage segment. All tokens in the segment shall be
tagged as foreign words (e.g. FM in the German
STTS tag set, ET in the French Le Monde tag set
(Abeillé et al., 2003)), and each lemma shall get

24



the special symbol @fn@ to set it apart from lem-
mas of the surrounding sentence. In this paper we
report on our experiments towards this goal and
suggest an algorithm for detecting code-switching.

We adopt a wide definition of code-switching.
We are interested in detecting all instances where
a text is in a dominant language and contains
words, phrases and sentences in another language.
Though our definition is broad, it is clearly more
restricted than others, as e.g. the definition by
Kracht and Klein (2014) which includes special
purpose codes like bank account numbers or shoe
sizes.

In this paper we will give an overview of the
language mix in the yearbooks of the Swiss Al-
pine Club over the 150 years, and we will illus-
trate how we identified inter-sentential and intra-
sentential code-switching. We will give a quanti-
tative overview of the number of code-switching
candidates that we automatically located.

2 The Text+Berg Corpus

The Text+Berg corpus comprises the annual pu-
blications of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) from
its first edition in 1864 until 2013. From the start
until 1923 the official yearbook was called “Jahr-
buch des Schweizer Alpen-Club” (EN : yearbook
of the Swiss Alpine Club), and it typically consis-
ted of 500 to 700 pages. The articles of these first
60 years were mostly in German (with 86% of
the words), but some also in French (13% of the
words) and few in Italian and Romansh (Volk et
al., 2010).

Interestingly, the German articles contained
passages in French and sometimes other languages
(e.g. English, Swiss German, Latin) without trans-
lations, and vice versa. Obviously, the article au-
thors and yearbook editors assumed that the rea-
ders of the yearbook were polyglott at least in En-
glish, French, German and Latin during that time.
In fact, the members of the SAC in the 19th cen-
tury came from an academic elite. Mountain ex-
ploration was a past-time of the rich and educated.

Still, during that same time the French-speaking
sections of the Swiss Alpine Club published their
own yearbook in parallel to the official yearbook
and called it “Echo des Alpes”. It started shortly
after the official yearbook in the late 1860s and
continued until 1923. Each “Echo des Alpes” year-
book contained between 300 to 600 pages adding
up to a total of 22,582 pages with 7.4 million to-

kens, almost all in French with rare quotes in Ger-
man.

As of 1925 the official SAC yearbook and the
“Echo des Alpes” were merged into a new publi-
cation called “Die Alpen. Les Alpes. Le Alpi” (in
German, French, Italian) which has been publi-
shed ever since. Over the years it sometimes ap-
peared as quarterly and sometimes as monthly ma-
gazine. Today it appears 12 times per year in ma-
gazine format. For the sake of simplicity we conti-
nue to call each annual volume a yearbook.

The merger in 1925 resulted in a higher per-
centage of French texts in the new yearbook. For
example, the 1925 yearbook had around 143,000
words in German and 112,000 in French (56% to
44%). The ratio varied somewhat but was still at
64% to 36% in 1956.

From 1957 onwards, the SAC has published pa-
rallel (i.e. translated) French and German versions
of the yearbooks. At the start of this new era only
half of the articles were translated, the rest was
printed in the original language in identical ver-
sions in the two language copies.

Over the next decade the number of translations
increased and as of 1983 the yearbooks were com-
pletely translated between German and French.
Few Italian articles were still published verbatim
in both the French and German yearbooks. As of
2012 the SAC has launched an Italian language
version of its monthly magazine so that now it pro-
duces French, German and Italian parallel texts.

In its latest release the Text+Berg corpus (com-
prising the SAC yearbooks, the ALPEN maga-
zine and the Echo des Alpes) contains around
45.8 million tokens (after tokenization). French
and German account for around 22 million tokens
each, Italian accounts for 0.8 million tokens. The
remainder goes to English, Latin, Romansh and
Swiss German. The corpus is freely available for
research purposes upon request.

3 Language Identification in the
Text+Berg Corpus

We compiled the Text+Berg corpus by scanning
all SAC yearbooks from 1864 until 2000 (around
100,000+ pages). Afterwards we employed com-
mercial OCR software to convert the scan images
into electronic text. We developed and applied
techniques to automatically reduce the number of
OCR errors (Volk et al., 2011).

We obtained the yearbooks from 2001 to

2009 as PDF documents which we automatically
converted to text. The subsequent yearbooks from
2010 until 2013 we received as XML files from
the SAC.

We have turned the whole corpus into a uniform
XML format. For this, the OCR output texts as
well as the texts converted from PDF and XML
are structured and annotated by automatically mar-
king article boundaries, by tokenization, language
identification, Part-of-Speech tagging and lemma-
tization. Our processing pipeline also includes to-
ponym recognition and geo-coding of mountains,
glaciers, cabins, valleys, lakes and towns. Further-
more we recognize and co-reference person names
(Ebling et al., 2011), and we annotate temporal
expressions (date, time, duration and set) with a
variant of HeidelTime (Rettich, 2013). Finally we
analyze the parallel parts of our corpus and pro-
vide sentence alignment information that is com-
puted via BLEUalign (Sennrich and Volk, 2011).

In order to process our texts with language-
specific tools (e.g. PoS tagging and person name
recognition) we employed automatic language
identification on the sentence level. We used
Lingua-Ident 2 (developed by Michael Piotrowski)
to determine for each sentence in our corpus whe-
ther it is in English, French, German, Italian or Ro-
mansh. Lingua-Ident is a statistical language iden-
tifier based on letter n-gram frequencies. For long
sentences it reliably distinguishes between the lan-
guages. Unfortunately it often misclassifies short
sentences. Therefore we decided to use it only for
sentences with more than 40 characters. Shorter
sentences are assigned the language of the article.
This can be problematic for mixed language ar-
ticles. An alternative strategy would be to assign
the language of the previous sentence to short sen-
tences.

For sentences that Lingua-Ident judges as Ger-
man we run a second classifier that distinguishes
between Standard German and Swiss German dia-
lect text. Since there are no writing rules for Swiss
German dialects, they come in a variety of spel-
lings. We have compiled a list of typical Swiss
German words (e.g. Swiss-German : chli, chlii,
chlini, chline = German : klein, kleine = English :
small) that are not used in Standard German in or-
der to identify Swiss German sentences. 3

2. http ://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-Ident/
3. We are aware that the Text+Berg corpus contains also

occasional sentences (or sentence fragments) in other Ger-
man dialects (e.g. Austrian German, Bavarian German) and

Based on the language tag of each sentence
we are able to investigate coarse-grained code-
switching. Whenever the language of a sentence
deviates from the language of the article, we have a
candidate for code-switching. For example, in the
yearbook 1867 we find a German text (describing
the activities of the club) with a French quote :

Der Berichterstatter bemerkt darüber :
“On peut remarquer à cette occasion
qu’il est rare que par un effort de l’es-
prit on puisse mettre du brouillard en
bouteille, et . . . ” Die etwas ältere Sek-
tion Diablerets, deren Steuer Herr Au-
gust Bernus mit kundiger Hand . . .

Most code-switching occurs with direct speech,
quotes and book titles. The communicative goal is
obviously to make the text more authentic.

4 Related Work on Detection of
Code-Switching

Most previous work on automatically detecting
code-switching focused on the switches between
two known languages (whereas we have to deal
with a mix of 6 languages).

Solorio and Liu (2008) worked on real-time
prediction of code-switching points in Spanish-
English conversations. This means that the judge-
ment whether the current word is in a different lan-
guage than the language of the matrix clause can
only be based on the previous words. They use the
PoS tag and its probability plus the lemma as pro-
vided by both the Spanish and the English Tree-
Tagger as well as the position of the word in the
Beginning-Inside-Outside scheme as features for
making the decision. In order to keep the number
of experiments manageable they restricted their
history to one or two preceding words. As an inter-
esting experiment they generated code-switching
sentences Spanish-English based on their different
predictors and asked human judges to rate the na-
turalness of the resulting sentences. This helped
them to identify the most useful code-switching
predictor.

Vu et al. (2013) and Adel et al. (2013) consi-
der English-Mandarin code-switching in speech
recognition. They investigate recurrent neural net-
work language models and factored language mo-
dels to the task in an attempt to integrate syntac-
tic features. For the experiments they use SEAME,

in old German spellings. Since these varieties are rare in the
corpus, we do not deal with them explicitly.

the South East Asia Mandarin-English speech cor-
pus compiled from Singaporean and Malaysian
speakers. It consists of spontaneous interviews
and conversations. The transcriptions were clea-
ned and each word was manually tagged as En-
glish, Mandarin or other. The data consists of an
intensive mix of the two languages with the ave-
rage duration of both English and Mandarin seg-
ments to be less than a second ( !). In order to as-
sign PoS tags to this mixed language corpus, the
authors applied two monolingual taggers and com-
bined the results.

Huang and Yates (2014) also work on the de-
tection of English-Chinese code-switching but not
on speech but rather on web forum texts produ-
ced by Chinese speakers living in the US. They
use statistical word alignment and a Chinese lan-
guage model to substitute English words in Chi-
nese sentences with suitable Chinese words. Pre-
paring the data in this way significantly improved
Machine Translation quality. Their approach is li-
mited to two known languages and to very short
code-switching phrases (typically only one word).

Tim Baldwin and his group (Hughes et al.,
2006) have surveyed the approaches to language
identification at the time. They found a number of
missing issues, such as language identification for
minority languages, open class language identifi-
cation (in contrast to identification within a fixed
set of languages), sparse training data, varying
encodings, and multilingual documents. Subse-
quently they (Lui and Baldwin, 2011) introduced a
system for language identification of 97 languages
trained on a mixture of corpora from different
domains. They claim that their system Langid is
particularly well suited for classifying short input
strings (as in Twitter messages). We therefore tes-
ted Langid in our experiments for code-switching
detection.

5 Exploratory Experiments with the
SAC Yearbook 1925

In order to assess the performance of Langid
for the detection of code-switching we performed
an exploratory experiment with the SAC yearbook
1925. We extracted all word sequences between
pairs of quotation marks where at least one token
had been assigned the “unknown” lemma by our
PoS tagger. The “unknown” lemma indicates that
this word sequence may come from a different lan-
guage.

The word sequence had to be at least 4 cha-
racters long, thus skipping single letters and ab-
breviations. In this way we obtained 333 word
sequences that are potential candidates for intra-
sentential code-switching. We then ran these word
sequences through the Langid language identifica-
tion system with the restriction that we expect the
word sequences only to be either English, French,
German, Italian or Latin (Romansh and Swiss Ger-
man are not included in Langid). For a given string
Langid delivers the most likely language together
with a confidence score.

We then compared the language predicted by
the Langid system with the (automatically) com-
puted language of the complete sentence. In 189
out of the 333 sentences the Langid output pre-
dicted a code-switch. We then manually graded all
Langid judgements and found that 225 language
judgements (67.5%) were correct. But only 89 of
the 189 predicted code-switches came with the
correct language. 40 of the 100 incorrect judge-
ments were actually code-switches but with a dif-
ferent language. The remaining ones should have
been classified with the same language as the sur-
rounding sentence and are thus no examples of
code-switching.

A closer inspection of the results revealed that
the book contained not only code-switches in the
expected 5 languages, but also into Romansh (6),
Spanish (4) and Swiss-German (13). Obviously all
of these were incorrectly classified. Most (8) of
the Swiss-German word sequences were classified
as German which could count as half correct, but
the others were misclassified as English (among
them a variant of the popular Swiss German fare-
well phrase uf Wiederluege spelled as uf’s Wieder-
luege).

The Langid system has a tendency to classify
word sequences as English. Many of the short, in-
correctly classified word sequences were judged
as English. It turns out that Langid judges even the
empty string as English with a score of 9.06. The-
refore all judgements with this score are dubious.
We found that 56 short word sequences were clas-
sified as English with this score, out of which 35
were erroneously judged as English. Only strings
with a length of 15 and more characters that are
classified as English should be trusted. All others
need to be discarded.

In general, if precision is the most important as-
pect, then Langid should only be used for strings

with 20 or more characters. In our test set only 4
strings that were longer than 20 characters were
incorrectly classified within the selected language
set. Among the errors was the famous Latin phrase
conditio sine qua non (length : 21 characters inclu-
ding blanks) which Langid incorrectly classified
as Italian.

Another reason for the considerable number of
misclassifications can be repeated occurrences of
a word sequence. Our error count is a token-based
count and thus prone to misclassified recurring
phrases. In our experiment, Langid misclassified
the French book name Echo des Alpes as Italian.
Unfortunately this name occurs 18 times in our
test set and thus accounts for 18 errors. We suspect
that an -o at the end of a word is a strong indicator
for Italian. In a short string like Echo des Alpes (14
characters), this can make the difference.

Another interesting observation is that hyphens
speak for German. Our test set contains the hy-
phenated French string vesse-de-neige which Lan-
gid misclassifies as German with a clear margin
over French. When the same string is analyzed
without hyphens, then Langid correctly computes
a preference for French over German. A similar
observation comes from the Swiss German phrase
uf’s Wiederluege being classified as English when
spelled with the apostrophe (which is less frequent
in German than in English). Without the apos-
trophe Langid would count the string as German.
With short strings like this, special symbols have a
visible impact on the language identification.

We also observed that Langid is sensitive to
all-caps capitalization. For example, AUS DEM
LEBEN DER GEBIRGSMUNDARTEN (EN : The
Lives of Mountain Dialects) is misclassified as En-
glish (with the default score) while Aus dem Le-
ben der Gebirgsmundarten is correctly classified
as German.

Overall, we found that code-switching within
the same article rarely targets different languages.
For example, if the article is in German and
contains code-switches into English, then it hardly
ever contains code-switches into other languages.

In analogy to the one-sense-per-discourse hypo-
thesis we might call this the one-code-switch-
language-per-discourse hypothesis.

6 Detecting Intra-sentential
Code-Switching

Based on exploratory studies and observations
we decided on the following algorithm for detec-
ting and annotating intra-sentential foreign lan-
guage segments in the Text+Berg corpus. We
search for sub-sentential token sequences (possi-
bly of length 1) that are framed by a pair of quota-
tion marks and that contain at least one “unknown”
lemma. There must be at least two tokens outside
of the quotation marks in the same sentence. As
a compromise we restrict our detection to strings
longer than 15 characters so that we get relati-
vely reliable language judgements by Langid. The
strings may consist of one token that is longer than
15 characters (e.g. Matterhornhochtourist) or a se-
quence of tokens whose sum of characters inclu-
ding blanks is more than 15. We feed these can-
didate strings to Langid for language identifica-
tion and compare the output language with the lan-
guage attribute of the surrounding sentence. If the
languages are different, then we regard the token
sequence as code-switch and mark it accordingly
in XML as shown in figure 2.

In order to determine the precision of this al-
gorithm, we checked 10 yearbooks from 1868 to
1878 (there was no yearbook in 1870) and from
1926 to 1935. The results are in table 1. From
the 1180 code-switch candidates that we compu-
ted based on the above restrictions, Langid predic-
ted 456 code-switches (39%). This means that in
39% of the cases Langid predicted a language that
was different from the language of the surrounding
sentence.

We manually evaluated all 456 predicted code-
switches and found that 354 of them (78%) were
correctly classified and labeled. These segments
were indeed in a different language than the sur-
rounding sentence and their language was cor-
rectly determined. For example, the French seg-

ment in the following German sentence is cor-
rectly detected and classified :

très défavorables� auf den Monte Rosa
... (Die Alpen, 1935) (EN : After-
wards Ambros led the same 3 mountai-
neers �under very unfavorable condi-
tions� onto Monte Rosa.)

Out of the 102 segments whose language
was wrongly classified, only 36 were no code-
switches. For example, the Latin segment cum
grano salis africani is indeed a code-switch in
a German sentence although Langid incorrectly
classifies it as English. In fact, our evaluation sho-
wed that Langid is “reluctant” to classify strings as
Latin. Latin strings are often misclassified as En-
glish or Italian.

Overall this means that only 8% of the predicted
code-switches are no code-switches. Therefore we
can safely add the module for code-switch detec-
tion into our processing and annotation pipeline.

In order to estimate the recall of our quota-
tion filtering approach we manually evaluated a
sample of the quotations that our algorithm exclu-
ded. Table 2 presents the numbers for the two time
periods for two cases : first for sequences that are
longer than 15 characters and contain only known
lemmas, second for sequences that are shorter than
16 characters and contain at least one “unknown”
lemma. For both cases we checked 100 instances.

The evaluation for the quotations with more
than 15 characters but with all known lemmas (no
“unknown” lemma) shows only 2 false negatives.
Therefore, we can conclude safely that most of the
code-switches with more than 15 characters were
included in our candidate set.

Table 2 also shows that there were 1540 quota-
tions with 15 or less characters. The manual ins-
pection of 100 randomly selected quotations re-

vealed that 31 indeed include foreign material.
Some of these quotations are geographic names,
e.g. the valley Bergell (EN/IT : Val Bregaglia),
where it is difficult to decide whether this should
be regarded as a code-switch. For this evaluation,
we sticked to the principle that a foreign geogra-
phic name in quotation marks counts as a code-
switch. The number of missed code-switches is
high (31%). However, due to the limited preci-
sion of Langid (and other character-based lan-
guage identifiers) for short character sequences,
we still consider our length threshold appropriate.
A different approach to language identification is
needed to reliably classify these short quotes.

7 Discussion

The correctly marked code-switches in our test
periods can be split by language of the matrix sen-
tence and the language of the sub-sentential seg-
ment (= the code-switch segment). Table 3 gives
an overview of the types of code-switches for the
two periods under investigation. We see clearly
that code-switches from German to English were
rare in the 19th century (8 out of 89 = 9%) but be-
came much more popular in the 1920s and 1930s
(61 out of 265 = 23%). This came at the cost of
French which lost ground from 54% (48 out of 89)
to 40% (106 out of 265).

One can only compare the code-switch num-
bers from German with the corresponding num-
bers from French after normalizing the numbers
in relation to the overall amount of text in Ger-
man and French. During the first period (1868 to
1878) we count roughly 200,000 tokens in French
and 1.4 million tokens in German, whereas in the
second period (1926 to 1935) we have around 1
million tokens in French and again 1.4 million
tokens in German. For the first period we find
87 code-switches (triggered by quotation marks)
in the 1.4 million German tokens compared to
189 code-switches in the second period. The num-

ber of code-switches have clearly increased. For
French we observe the same trend with 2 code-
switches in 200’000 words in the first period com-
pared to 68 code-switches in the 1 million tokens
in the second period.

There is also a striking difference between
French and German with many more code-
switches in German than in French. For instance,
for German we find 135 code-switches per 1 mil-
lion tokens in the second period vs. 68 code-
switches per 1 million tokens for French.

One surprising finding were the code-switches
into Latin. We had not noticed them before, since
our corpus does not contain longer passages of La-
tin text. But this study shows that code-switches

man and 2 out of French).

On the negative side (cf. table 4), misclassi-
fying segments as English is the most frequent
cause for a wrong language assignment in both
periods. Table 5 shows the confusion matrix which
contrasts the manually determined segment lan-
guage with the incorrect language predicted by
Langid. This confirms that Langid has a tendency
to classify short text segments as English. But
there are also a number of errors for Latin being
mistaken for Italian, and German being mistaken
for Italian or French.

As a general remark, it should be noted that an
n-gram-based language identifier has advantages
over a lexicon-based language identifier in the face
of OCR errors. In the yearbook 1926 we observed
the rare case of a whole English sentence having
been contracted to one token Ilovetobemothered.
Still, our code-switch detector recognizes this as
an English string. 4

8 Conclusions

We have described our efforts in language iden-
tification in a multilingual corpus of Alpine texts.
As part of corpus annotation we have identified
the language of each corpus sentence amongst En-
glish, French, Standard German, Swiss German,

4. The complete sentence is : Un long Anglais, avec le-
quel, dans le hall familial, je m’essaie à échanger laborieu-
sement quelques impressions à ce sujet, me dit :�I love to be
mothered.�

Italian and Romansh. Furthermore we have de-
veloped an algorithm to identify intra-sentential
code-switching by analyzing sentence parts in
quotation marks that contain “unknown” lemmas.

We have shown that token sequences that
amount to 15 or more characters can be judged by
a state-of-the-art language identifier and will result
in 78% correctly labeled code-switches. Another
14% are code-switches but with a language dif-
ferent from the auto-assigned language. Only 8%
are not code-switches at all.

There are many ways to continue and extend
this research. We have not included language iden-
tification for Swiss German nor for Romansh in
the intra-sentential code-switch experiments re-
ported in this paper. We will train language models
for these two languages and add them to Langid
to check the impact on the recognition accuracy.
Since code-switches into Romansh are rare, and
since Romansh can easily be confused with Ita-
lian, it is questionable whether the addition of this
language model will have a positive influence.

We have used the “general-purpose” language
identifier Langid in these experiments. It will be
interesting to investigate language identifiers that
are optimized for short text fragments as discus-
sed by Vatanen et al. (2010). Given the relati-
vely high number of short quotations (31%) that
contain code-switches, recall could improve consi-
derably.

In this paper we have focused solely on code-
switching candidates that are triggered by pairs of
quotation marks. In order to increase the recall we
will certainly enlarge the set of triggers to other in-
dicators such as parentheses or commas. We have
briefly looked at parentheses as trigger symbols
and found them clearly less productive than quo-
tation marks. To also find code-switches that have
no overt marker remains the ultimate goal.

Finally, we will exploit the parallel parts of our
corpus. If a sentence in German contains a French
segment, then it is likely that this French segment
occurs verbatim in the parallel French sentence.
Based on sentence and word alignment we will
search for identical phrases in both language ver-
sions. We hope that this will lead to high accuracy
code-switch data that we can use as training mate-
rial for machine learning experiments.
