Abstract

In modern Chinese articles or conversations,
it is very popular to involve a few English
words, especially in emails and Internet liter-
ature. Therefore, it becomes an important and
challenging topic to analyze Chinese-English
mixed texts. The underlying problem is how
to tag part-of-speech (POS) for the English
words involved. Due to the lack of specially
annotated corpus, most of the English words
are tagged as the oversimplified type, “foreign
words”. In this paper, we present a method
using dynamic features to tag POS of mixed
texts. Experiments show that our method
achieves higher performance than traditional
sequence labeling methods. Meanwhile, our
method also boosts the performance of POS
tagging for pure Chinese texts.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, Chinese-English mixed texts are
prevalent in modern articles or emails. More and
more English words are used in Chinese texts as
names of organizations, products, terms and abbre-
viations, such as “eBay”, “iPhone”, “GDP”, “An-
droid” etc. On the other hand, it is also a common
phenomenon to use Chinese-English mixed texts
in daily conversation, especially in communication
among employers in large international corporations.
There are some challenges for analyzing Chinese-

English mixed texts:

1. How to define the POS tags for English words
in these mixed texts. Since the standard of
POS tags for English and Chinese are different,
we cannot use English POS to tag the English
words in mixed texts.

2. Due to lack of annotated corpus for mixed texts,
most of the English words are tagged as “for-
eign words”, which is oversimplified. So we
cannot use them in further processing for the
syntactic and semantic analysis.

3. Most English words used in mixed texts are of-
ten out-of-vocabulary (OOV), which thus in-
creases the difficulties to tag them.

Currently, the mainstream method of Chinese
POS tagging is joint segmentation & tagging with
cross-labels, which can avoid the problem of error
propagation and achieve higher performance on both
subtasks(Ng and Low, 2004). Each label is the cross-
product of a segmentation label and a tagging la-
bel, e.g. {B-NN, I-NN, E-NN, S-NN, ...}. The fea-
tures are generated by position-based templates on
character-level.
Since the main part of mixed texts is in Chinese

and the role of English word is more like Chinese,
we use Chinese POS tags (Xia, 2000) to tag English
words. Since the categories of the most commonly
used English words are nouns, verbs and adjectives,
we can use “NN”, “NR”, “VV”, “VA”, “JJ” to label
their POS tags.
For the English proper nouns and verbs, there

are no significant differences in Chinese and En-
glish POS tags except that English features plural
and tense forms.
For the English nouns, these are some English

nouns used as verbs, such as “我很 [fan/VV]他。(I
adore him very much.)” where “fan” means “adore”
and is used as a verb.
For the English adjectives, there are two corre-

sponding Chinese POS tags “VA” and “JJ”. For ex-
ample, the roles of some English words in Table 1,

1379

Texts

sional/VA]。

sional.

感觉很 [high/VA]。 Feel very high.
他是 [super/JJ] [star/NN] He is a super star.

such as “professional” and “high”, are different with
their original ones.

Therefore, the POS tagging for mixed texts cannot
be settled with simple methods, such as looking up
in a dictionary.

One of the main differences between Chinese and
English in POS tagging is that the two languages
have character-based features and word-based fea-
tures respectively. To ensure the consistency of tag-
ging models, we prefer to use word-level informa-
tion in Chinese, which is both useful for Chinese-
English mixed texts and Chinese-only texts. For in-
stance, in a sentence “X 或者 Y ... (X or Y ...)”,
the word Y ought to have the same POS tag as the
word X . Another example is that the word follow-
ing a pronoun is usually a verb, and adjectives of-
ten describe nouns. Some related works show that
word-level features can improve the performance of
Chinese POS tagging (Jiang et al., 2008; Sun, 2011).

In this paper, we propose a method to tag mixed
texts with dynamic features. Our method combines
these dynamic features, which are dynamically gen-
erated at the decoding stage, with traditional static
features. For Chinese-English mixed texts, the tra-
ditional features cannot yield a satisfied result due to
lack of training data. The proposed dynamic features
can improve the performance by using the informa-
tion of a word, such as POS tag or length of the whole
word, which is proven effective by experiments.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In
section 2, we introduce the sequence labeling mod-
els, thenwe describe our method of dynamic features
in section 3 and analyze its complexity in section 4.
Section 5 describes the training method. The exper-
imental results are manifested in section 6. Finally,
We review the relevant research works in section 7
and conclude our work in section 8.

2 Sequence Labeling Models

Sequence labeling is the task of assigning labels
y = y1, . . . , yn to an input sequence x = x1, . . . , xn.
Given a sample x, we define the feature Φ(x, y).
Thus, we can label x with a score function,

ŷ = argmax
y

F (w, Φ(x, y)), (1)

where w is the parameter of function F (·).
For sequence labeling, the feature can be denoted

asϕk(yi, yi−1, x, i), where i stands for the position in
the sequence and k stands for the number of feature
templates.
we use online Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm

(Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2006)
to train the model parameters. Following (Collins,
2002), the average strategy is used to avoid the over-
fitting problem.

3 Dynamic Features

The form of traditional features is shown in Table
2, where C represents a Chinese character, and T
represents the character-based tag. The subscript i
indicates its position related to the current character.

Table 2: Traditional Feature Templates
Ci, T0(i = −2,−1, 0, 1, 2)

Ci, Cj , T0(i, j = −2,−1, 0, 1, 2 and i ̸= j)
T−1, T0

Traditional features are generated by position-
fixed templates. Since the length of Chinese word
is unfixed, their meanings are incomplete. We cat-
egorize them as “static” features since they can be
calculated before tagging (except “T−1, T0”).
The form of dynamic features is shown in Table

3, where WORD represents a Chinese word, and
POS (LEN ) is the POS tag (length) of the word.
The subscript of dynamic feature template indicates
its position related to the current word.
Table 4 shows an example. If the current posi-

tion is “ Apple”, then {POS−1=CC, POS−2=NR,
WORD−1=“和”, LEN−2=2}. Since these features
are unavailable before tagging, we call them “dy-
namic” features.

POSi, WORDj , T0(i, j = −2,−1, 0)
WORDi, LENj , POSk, T0(i, j, k = −2,−1, 0)

…

Dynamic features are more flexible because the
number of involved characters is dependent on the
length of previous words. Unlike static features, dy-
namic features do not merely rely on the input se-
quence C1:n, so the weights of dynamic features, in
which POS/LEN are involved, can be trained by
Chinese-only texts and used by mixed texts, which
resolve the problem of the lack of training data.

4 Tagging with Dynamic Features

In the tagging stage, we use the current best result
to approximately calculate the unknown tag infor-
mation. For an input sequence C1:n, the current best
tags from index 0 to i−1 can be calculated by Viterbi
algorithm and they can be used to generate dynamic
features for index i. The specific algorithm is shown
in Algorithm 1.
Here is an example to explain the time com-

plexity of the dynamic features. Normal template
xi−2xi−1yi requires to look for the positions of
i − 2 and i − 1 related to the current character
xi, but dynamic template posi−2posi−1yi needs to
know the pos tags of two words. If the length of
wordi−1/wordi−2 is 2, then the positions of i−4, i−
3, i−2, i−1 are needed to generate the dynamic fea-
tures.
For all dynamic features, it is unnecessary to

repetitively calculate the POS/WORD/LEN ar-
ray. Apart from that one time calculation of the ar-
ray, no distinction can be found between the time
complexity of the dynamic features and the tradi-
tional features. For input C1:n, the time complexity
isO(n∗[O(op.2)+(Ts.num+Td.num)∗O(op.1)+
O(op.4)]), n.b. O(op.1) = O(op.3). Universally
the dynamic features only require the information of
position i − 2 and i − 1, so the time complexity of
calculating the POS/WORD/LEN array can be
ignored as compared with the complexity of Viterbi
algorithm and feature extraction. The approximate
algorithm is thus faster than the Brute-Force way by

for ts in Ts do

// create feature string Fs (Op.1)
Fs = createFeature(C1:n, ts);
W [i] += getWeightVector(Fs);

end
// create a list of <posk,wordk,lenk>
// (k = 0,−1,−2 . . .) (Op.2)
dList = getCurrentBestPath(Max, Vp);
for td in Td do

// create dynamic features string Fd
// (Op.3)
Fd = createFeature(C1:n, td, dList);
W [i] += getWeightVector(Fd);

end
// Update Vs[i], Vp[i] (Op.4)
viterbi_OneStep(Vs[i− 1], W [i], M );
Max = argmaxi(Vs[i]) ;

5 Training

Given an example (x, y), ŷ are denoted as the in-
correct labels with the highest score

ŷ = argmax
z ̸=y

wT Φ(x, z). (2)

The margin γ(w; (x, y)) is defined as

γ(w; (x, y)) = wT Φ(x, y)− wT Φ(x, ŷ). (3)

Thus, we calculate the hinge loss ℓ(w; (x, y), (ab-
breviated as ℓw) by

1381

ℓw =

1− γ(w; (x, y)), otherwise (4)

In round k, the new weight vector wk+1 is calcu-
lated by

wk+1 = argminw

||w− wk||2 + C · ξ,

s.t. ℓ(w; (xk, yk)) <= ξ and ξ >= 0 (5)

where ξ is a non-negative slack variable, and C is
a positive parameter which controls the influence of
the slack term on the objective function.
Following the derivation in PA (Crammer et al.,

2006), we can get the update rule,

wk+1 = wk + τk(Φ(xk, yk)− Φ(xk, ŷk)), (6)

where

τk = min(C,
ℓwk

∥Φ(xk, yk)− Φ(xk, ŷk)∥2
) (7)

Our algorithm based on PA algorithm is shown in
Algorithm 2.

6 Experiments

We implement our system based on FudanNLP1.
We employ the commonly used label set {B, I, E,
S} for the segmentation part of cross-labels. {B,
I, E} represent Begin, Inside, End of a multi-node
segmentation respectively, and S represents a Single
node segmentation.
The F1 score is used for evaluation, which is the

harmonic mean of precision P (percentage of pre-
dict phrases that exactlymatch the reference phrases)
and recallR (percentage of reference phrases that re-
turned by system).
The feature templates, which are used to extract

features, are listed in Table 5. We set traditional
method (static features) as the baseline. The detailed
experimental settings and results are reported in the
following subsections.

6.1 POS Tagging for Chinese-only Texts
Before the experiments onChinese-Englishmixed

texts, we evaluate the performance of our method on
Chinese-only texts. We use the CTB dataset from
the POS tagging task of the Fourth International Chi-
nese Language Processing Bakeoff (SIGHAN Bake-
off 2008)(Jin and Chen, 2008). The details are
shown in Table 6.
The performance comparison on joint segmenta-

tion & POS tagging is shown in Table 7. Our method
obtains an error reduction of 6.7% over the baseline.
The reason is that our dynamic features can utilize

6.2 POS Tagging for Chinese-English Mixed
Texts

Without annotated corpus for Chinese-English
mixed texts, we use synthetic data as the alternative.
In Chinese-English mixed texts, English words of
noun(NN/NR), verb(VV/VA) and adjective(JJ) cat-
egories are the most commonly used, so we ran-
domly transform a certain percentage of Chinese
words with these POS tags in the SIGHAN Bakeoff
2008 dataset(Jin and Chen, 2008) into their English
counterparts.

6.2.1 Synthetic Data
Before trying out an experiment, we first study

how to generate the data of mixed texts.
We use two ways to produce the synthetic data:

“Respective Replacement” and “Unified Replace-
ment”.

Respective Replacement We replace the selected
Chinese words into their corresponding English
counterparts.

Unified Replacement We replace the selected Chi-
nese words with a unified labelENG. The rea-
son we use the labelENG instead of real words
is that we want to consider the context of these

words but not the words themselves and over-
come the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
English words.

For our experiments, we just select 5% of the Chi-
nese nouns and verbs from SIGHAN dataset, and re-
place them in the above two ways. After replace-
ment, the training and test data have 12780 and 1254
English words, respectively. 5189 words are gener-
ated by way of “Respective Replacement”. In the
test data, 326words are OOV, which comprises 25%
of the whole vocabulary. The information of gener-
ated data is shown in Table 8.

Table 8: The Synthetic Chinese-English Mixed Dataset

Dataset Numbers of ENGNN VV

We use H1 to represent the dataset generated by
way of “Respective Replacement”, and H2 for the
dataset by way of with “Unified Replacement”. The
experimental results on these two datasets are shown
in Table 9.

Our H1 75.60 54.60 89.79
H2 79.82 77.61 89.81

From Table 9, we can see that the “Unified
Replacement” way is better than the “Respective
Replacement” way for both the baseline and our
method. The main reason is that the “Unified Re-
placement” way can greatly improve the tagging per-
formance of OOV words.

6.2.2 Detail Comparisons
For detail comparisons of all situations of

mixed texts, we design six synthetic datasets,
A/B/C/D1/D2/E by randomly selecting 10% or
15% of Chinese words (“NN/NR/VV/VA/JJ”) in the

1383



above SIGHANBakeoff 2008 dataset, and replacing
them with English label ENG.
The differences of these datasets are as following:

• Dataset A only contains English words with
tags “NN/VV”.

• Dataset B contains English words with tags
“NN/VV/VA”.

• Dataset C contains one more tag “NR” than
Dataset B.

• Datasets D1 and D2 contain one more tag “JJ”
than Dataset B. The difference between D1
and D2 is that D2 has about 50%more English
words than D1 in training set.

• Dataset E contains English words with all the
tags “NN/NR/VV/VA/JJ”.

The detailed information of datasets
A/B/C/D1/D2/E is shown in Table 10.

The results are shown in Table 11. On dataset E,
our method achieves 6.78% higher performance on
tagging ENG labels than traditional static features.
This result is reasonable because our model can use
more flexible feature templates to extract features
and reduce the problem of being dependent on spe-
cific English words.
Tables 12/13/14/15/16/17 show the detailed re-

sults on datasets A/B/C/D1/D2/E.

Experiment on dataset A gets the best result be-
cause “NN” and “VV” can be easily distinguished by
its context. Sometimes, “VA” has the similar context
with “VV”, experiment on datasetB shows its influ-
ence. The performances on datasetsB/C/E descend
in turn. The reason is that words with tag “NN” or
“NR/JJ” have the similar usage/contexts in Chinese.
Since we use the same form ENG instead of real
words, there are no differences between these words,
which leads to some errors. Though the datasets is
generated randomly, we can see our method perform
better on every dataset than the baseline.

6.3 POS Tagging for Mixed Texts with a Real
Dataset

To investigate the actual performance, we collect
a real dataset from Web, which consists of 142 rep-
resentative Chinese-English mixed sentences. This
dataset contains 4, 238 Chinese characters and 275
English words. Since we focus on the performance
for English words, we only label the POS tags of the
English words. Table 18 shows some examples in
the real dataset of mixed texts.

The information of the real dataset is shown in Ta-
ble 19. If all involved English words are tagging as
“NN”, the precision is just 56%.

Since there is no noun-modifier “JJ” in our col-
lected data. We use the models trained on dataset
B and C to tag the real data. The results are shown
in Table 20. The difference between model B and
C is that model B regards all words with tag “NR”
as “NN”. Since it is difficult to distinguish between
“NR” and “NN” merely according to the context,
model B performs better than model C.
The detail results of model B and C are shown in

In recent years, POS tagging has undergone great
development. The mainstream method is to regard
POS tagging as sequence labeling problems (Ra-
biner, 1990; Xue, 2003; Peng et al., 2004; Ng and
Low, 2004).
However, the analysis of Chinese-English mixed

texts is rarely involved in previous literature. In
the aspect of the general multilingual POS tagging,
most works focus on modeling cross-lingual corre-
lations and tagging multilingual POS on respective
monolingual texts, not on mixed texts (Cucerzan and
Yarowsky, 2002; Yarowsky et al., 2001; Naseem et
al., 2009).
Since we choose to use dynamic word-level fea-

tures to improve the performance of POS tagging,
we also review some works on word-level features.

Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-
CRF) (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004) is a model in
which segmentation task is implicitly included into
the decoding algorithm. In this model, feature rep-
resentation would be more flexible than traditional
CRFs, since features can be extracted from the previ-
ous/the next segmentation within a window of vari-
able size. The problem of this approach lies in that
the decoding algorithm depends on the predefined
window size to exploit the boundaries of segmenta-
tions but not the real length of words.

Bunescu (2008) presents an improved pipeline
model in which the output of the previous subtasks
are considered as hidden variables, and the hidden
variables together with their probabilities denoting
the confidence are used as probabilistic features in
the next subtasks. One shortcoming of this method
is inefficiency caused by the calculation of marginal
probabilities of features. The other disadvantages
of the pipeline method are error propagation and the
need of separate training of different subtasks in the
pipeline. Another disadvantage of pipeline method
is error propagation.

Jiang et al. (2008) proposes a cascaded linear
model for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS
tagging. With a character-based perceptron as the
core, combinedwith real-valued features such as lan-
guage models, the cascaded model can efficiently
utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to
incorporate into the perceptron directly. However,
they use POS tags or word information in a Brute-
Force way, which may suffer from the problem of
time complexity.

Sun (2011) presents a stacked sub-word model for
joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.
By merging the outputs of the three predictors (in-
cluding one word-based segmenter) into sub-word
sequences, rich contextual features can be approx-
imately derived. The experiments are conducted to
show the effectiveness of using word-based informa-
tion.

The difference between the above methods and
ours is that our word-level features are dynamically
generated in the decoding stage without exhaustive
or preprocessed word segmentation.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we focus on Chinese-English mixed
texts and use dynamic features for POS tagging.
To overcome the problem of the lack of annotated
corpus on mixed texts, our features use both lo-
cal and non-local information and take advantage of
the characteristics of Chinese-English mixed texts.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. It should be noted that our method is
also effective for the mixed texts of Chinese and any
foreign languages since we use “Unified Replace-
ment”.
For future works, we plan to improve our approx-

imate tagging algorithm to reduce error propagation.
In addition, we will refer to an English dictionary
to generate some useful features to distinguish be-
tween “NR” and “NN” in Chinese-English mixed
texts and add some statistical features derived from
English resources, such as the most common tag of
each English word. We would also like to investi-
gate these features in more applications of natural
language processing, such as name entity recogni-
tion, information extraction, etc.
