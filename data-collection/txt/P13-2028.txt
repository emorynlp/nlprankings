Abstract

Post-retrieval clustering is the task of clus-
tering Web search results. Within this
context, we propose a new methodology
that adapts the classical K-means algo-
rithm to a third-order similarity measure
initially developed for NLP tasks. Results
obtained with the definition of a new stop-
ping criterion over the ODP-239 and the
MORESQUE gold standard datasets evi-
dence that our proposal outperforms all re-
ported text-based approaches.

1 Introduction

Post-retrieval clustering (PRC), also known as
search results clustering or ephemeral clustering,
is the task of clustering Web search results. For
a given query, the retrieved Web snippets are au-
tomatically clustered and presented to the user
with meaningful labels in order to minimize the
information search process. This technique can
be particularly useful for polysemous queries but
it is hard to implement efficiently and effectively
(Carpineto et al., 2009). Indeed, as opposed to
classical text clustering, PRC must deal with small
collections of short text fragments (Web snippets)
and be processed in run-time.

As a consequence, most of the successful
methodologies follow a monothetic approach (Za-
mir and Etzioni, 1998; Ferragina and Gulli, 2008;
Carpineto and Romano, 2010; Navigli and Crisa-
fulli, 2010; Scaiella et al., 2012). The underlying
idea is to discover the most discriminant topical
words in the collection and group together Web
snippets containing these relevant terms. On the
other hand, the polythetic approach which main
idea is to represent Web snippets as word feature
vectors has received less attention, the only rele-
vant work being (Osinski and Weiss, 2005). The
main reasons for this situation are that (1) word

feature vectors are hard to define in small collec-
tions of short text fragments (Timonen, 2013), (2)
existing second-order similarity measures such as
the cosine are unadapted to capture the seman-
tic similarity between small texts, (3) Latent Se-
mantic Analysis has evidenced inconclusive re-
sults (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) and (4) the la-
beling process is a surprisingly hard extra task
(Carpineto et al., 2009).

This paper is motivated by the fact that the poly-
thetic approach should lead to improved results if
correctly applied to small collections of short text
fragments. For that purpose, we propose a new
methodology that adapts the classical K-means
algorithm to a third-order similarity measure ini-
tially developed for Topic Segmentation (Dias et
al., 2007). Moreover, the adapted K-means algo-
rithm allows to label each cluster directly from its
centroids thus avoiding the abovementioned extra
task. Finally, the evolution of the objective func-
tion of the adapted K-means is modeled to auto-
matically define the “best” number of clusters.

Finally, we propose different experiments over
the ODP-239 (Carpineto and Romano, 2010)
and MORESQUE (Navigli and Crisafulli, 2010)
datasets against the most competitive text-based
PRC algorithms: STC (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998),
LINGO (Osinski and Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC
(Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and the classical
bisecting incremental K-means (which may be
seen as a baseline for the polythetic paradigm)1.
A new evaluation measure called the b-cubed F -
measure (Fb3) and defined in (Amigó et al., 2009)
is then calculated to evaluate both cluster homo-
geneity and completeness. Results evidence that
our proposal outperforms all state-of-the-art ap-
proaches with a maximum Fb3 = 0.452 for ODP-
239 and Fb3 = 0.490 for MORESQUE.

1The TOPICAL algorithm proposed by (Scaiella et
al., 2012) is a knowledge-driven methodology based on
Wikipedia.

2 Polythetic Post-Retrieval Clustering

The K-means is a geometric clustering algorithm
(Lloyd, 1982). Given a set of n data points, the
algorithm uses a local search approach to partition
the points into K clusters. A set of K initial clus-
ter centers is chosen. Each point is then assigned
to the center closest to it and the centers are recom-
puted as centers of mass of their assigned points.
The process is repeated until convergence. To as-
sure convergence, an objective function Q is de-
fined which decreases at each processing step. The
classical objective function is defined in Equation
(1) where πk is a cluster labeled k, xi ∈ πk is
an object in the cluster, mπk is the centroid of the
cluster πk and E(., .) is the Euclidean distance.

Q =

K∑

k=1

xi∈πk

E(xi,mπk )
2. (1)

Within the context of PRC, the K-means algo-
rithm needs to be adapted to integrate third-order
similarity measures (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Dias
et al., 2007). Third-order similarity measures,
also called weighted second-order similarity mea-
sures, do not rely on exact matches of word fea-
tures as classical second-order similarity measures
(e.g. the cosine metric), but rather evaluate simi-
larity based on related matches. In this paper, we
propose to use the third-order similarity measure
called InfoSimba introduced in (Dias et al., 2007)
for Topic Segmentation and implement its simpli-
fied version S3s in Equation 2.

S3s (Xi, Xj) =
1

p2

p∑

k=1

p∑

l=1

Xik ∗Xjl ∗ S(Wik,Wjl). (2)

Given two Web snippets Xi and Xj , their sim-
ilarity is evaluated by the similarity of its con-
stituents based on any symmetric similarity mea-
sure S(., .) where Wik (resp. Wjl) corresponds to
the word at the kth (resp. lth) position in the vector
Xi (resp. Xj) and Xik (resp. Xjl) is the weight of
word Wik (resp. Wjl) in the set of retrieved Web
snippets. A direct consequence of the change in
similarity measure is the definition of a new ob-
jective function QS3s to ensure convergence. This
function is defined in Equation (3) and must be
maximized2.

2A maximization process can easily be transformed into a
minimization one

QS3s =

K∑

k=1

∑

xi∈πk

S3s (xi,mπk ). (3)

A cluster centroid mπk is defined by a vector of
p words (wπk1 , . . . , w

πk
p ). As a consequence, each

cluster centroid must be instantiated in such a way
that QS3s increases at each step of the clustering
process. The choice of the best p words repre-
senting each cluster is a way of assuring conver-
gence. For that purpose, we define a procedure
which consists in selecting the best p words from
the global vocabulary V in such a way that QS3s
increases. The global vocabulary is the set of all
words which appear in any context vector.

So, for each word w ∈ V and any symmet-
ric similarity measure S(., .), its interestingness
λk(w) is computed as regards to cluster πk. This
operation is defined in Equation (4) where si ∈ πk
is any Web snippet from cluster πk. Finally, the p
words with higher λk(w) are selected to construct
the cluster centroid. In such a way, we can easily
prove that QS3s is maximized. Note that a word
which is not part of cluster πk may be part of the
centroid mπk .

λk(w) =
1

Finally, we propose to rely on a modified ver-
sion of the K-means algorithm called Global K-
means (Likasa et al., 2003), which has proved to
lead to improved results. To solve a clustering
problem with M clusters, all intermediate prob-
lems with 1, 2, ...,M − 1 clusters are sequentially
solved. The underlying idea is that an optimal so-
lution for a clustering problem with M clusters
can be obtained using a series of local searches us-
ing the K-means algorithm. At each local search,
the M − 1 cluster centers are always initially
placed at their optimal positions corresponding to
the clustering problem with M − 1 clusters. The
remaining M th cluster center is initially placed at
several positions within the data space. In addi-
tion to effectiveness, the method is deterministic
and does not depend on any initial conditions or
empirically adjustable parameters. Moreover, its
adaptation to PRC is straightforward.

3 Stopping Criterion

Once clustering has been processed, selecting the
best number of clusters still remains to be decided.

154



For that purpose, numerous procedures have been
proposed (Milligan and Cooper, 1985). However,
none of the listed methods were effective or adapt-
able to our specific problem. So, we proposed
a procedure based on the definition of a ratio-
nal function which models the quality criterion
QS3s . To better understand the behaviour of QS3s
at each step of the adapted GK-means algorithm,
we present its values for K = 10 in Figure 1.

Figure 1: QS3s and its modelisation.

QS3s can be modelled as in Equation (5) which
converges to a limit α whenK increases and starts
from Q1S3s (i.e. QS3s at K = 1). The underlying
idea is that the best number of clusters is given by
the β value which maximizes the difference with
the average βmean. So, α, β and γ need to be
expressed independently of unknown variables.

∀K, f(K) = α− γ
Kβ

. (5)

As α can theoretically or operationally be de-
fined and it can easily be proved that γ = α−Q1S3s ,
β needs to be defined based on γ or α. This can
also be easily proved and the given result is ex-
pressed in Equation (6).

β =
log(α−Q1S3s )− log(α−Q

K
S3s

)

log(K)
. (6)

Now, the value of α which best approximates
the limit of the rational function must be defined.
For that purpose, we computed its maximum theo-
retical and experimental values as well as its ap-
proximated maximum experimental value based
on the δ2-Aitken (Aitken, 1926) procedure to ac-
celerate convergence as explained in (Kuroda et
al., 2008). Best results were obtained with the
maximum experimental value which is defined as
building the cluster centroid mπk for each Web

snippet individually. Finally, the best number of
clusters is defined as in Algorithm (1) and each
one receives its label based on the p words with
greater interestingness of its centroid mπk .

Algorithm 1 The best K selection procedure.
1. Calculate βK for each K
2. Evaluate the mean of all βK i.e. βmean

3. Select βK which maximizes βK − βmean
4. Return K as the best number of partitions

This situation is illustrated in Figure (1) where
the red line corresponds to the rational functional
for βmean and the blue line models the best β
value (i.e. the one which maximizes the difference
with βmean). In this case, the best number would
correspond to β6 and as a consequence, the best
number of clusters would be 6. In order to illus-
trate the soundness of the procedure, we present
the different values for β at each K iteration and
the differences between consecutive values of β at
each iteration in Figure 2. We clearly see that the
highest inclination of the curve is between clus-
ter 5 and 6 which also corresponds to the highest
difference between two consecutive values of β.

Figure 2: Values of β (on the left) and differences
between consecutive values of β (on the right).

4 Evaluation

Evaluating PRC systems is a difficult task as stated
in (Carpineto et al., 2009). Indeed, a successful
PRC system must evidence high quality level clus-
tering. Ideally, each query subtopic should be rep-
resented by a unique cluster containing all the rel-
evant Web pages inside. However, this task is far
from being achievable. As such, this constraint
is reformulated as follows: the task of PRC sys-
tems is to provide complete topical cluster cov-
erage of a given query, while avoiding excessive

redundancy of the subtopics in the result list of
clusters. So, in order to evaluate our methodol-
ogy, we propose two different evaluations. First,
we want to evidence the quality of the stopping
criterion when compared to an exhaustive search
over all tunable parameters. Second, we propose a
comparative evaluation with existing state-of-the-
art algorithms over gold standard datasets and re-
cent clustering evaluation metrics.

4.1 Text Processing

Before the clustering process takes place, Web
snippets are represented as word feature vectors.
In order to define the set of word features, the
Web service proposed in (Machado et al., 2009) is
used3. In particular, it assigns a relevance score to
any token present in the set of retrieved Web snip-
pets based on the analysis of left and right token
contexts. A specific threshold is then applied to
withdraw irrelevant tokens and the remaining ones
form the vocabulary V . Then, each Web snippet is
represented by the set of its p most relevant to-
kens in the sense of the W (.) value proposed in
(Machado et al., 2009). Note that within the pro-
posed Web service, multiword units are also iden-
tified. They are exclusively composed of relevant
individual tokens and their weight is given by the
arithmetic mean of their constituents scores.

3Access to this Web service is available upon request.

4.2 Intrinsic Evaluation
The first set of experiments focuses on understand-
ing the behaviour of our methodology within a
greedy search strategy for different tunable param-
eters defined as a tuple < p,K, S(Wik,Wjl) >.
In particular, p is the size of the word feature vec-
tors representing both Web snippets and centroids
(p = 2..5), K is the number of clusters to be
found (K = 2..10) and S(Wik,Wjl) is the col-
location measure integrated in the InfoSimba sim-
ilarity measure. In these experiments, two asso-
ciation measures which are known to have dif-
ferent behaviours (Pecina and Schlesinger, 2006)
are tested. We implement the Symmetric Condi-
tional Probability (Silva et al., 1999) in Equation
(7) which tends to give more credits to frequent as-
sociations and the Pointwise Mutual Information
(Church and Hanks, 1990) in Equation (8) which
over-estimates infrequent associations. Then, best
< p,K, S(Wik,Wjl) > configurations are com-
pared to our stopping criterion.

In order to perform this task, we evaluate per-
formance based on the Fb3 measure defined in
(Amigó et al., 2009) over the ODP-239 gold stan-
dard dataset proposed in (Carpineto and Romano,

156



2010). In particular, (Amigó et al., 2009) indi-
cate that common metrics such as the Fβ-measure
are good to assign higher scores to clusters with
high homogeneity, but fail to evaluate cluster com-
pleteness. First results are provided in Table 1 and
evidence that the best configurations for different
< p,K, S(Wik,Wjl) > tuples are obtained for
high values of p, K ranging from 4 to 6 clusters
and PMI steadily improving over SCP . How-
ever, such a fuzzy configuration is not satisfac-
tory. As such, we proposed a new stopping cri-
terion which evidences coherent results as it (1)
does not depend on the used association measure
(FSCPb3 = 0.452 and F

PMI
b3 = 0.450), (2) discov-

ers similar numbers of clusters independently of
the length of the p-context vector and (3) increases
performance with high values of p.

4.3 Comparative Evaluation

The second evaluation aims to compare our
methodology to current state-of-the-art text-based
PRC algorithms. We propose comparative exper-
iments over two gold standard datasets (ODP-239
(Carpineto and Romano, 2010) and MORESQUE
(Di Marco and Navigli, 2013)) for STC (Za-
mir and Etzioni, 1998), LINGO (Osinski and
Weiss, 2005), OPTIMSRC (Carpineto and Ro-
mano, 2010) and the Bisecting Incremental K-
means (BIK) which may be seen as a baseline for
the polythetic paradigm. A brief description of
each PRC algorithm is given as follows.

STC: (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998) defined the
Suffix Tree Clustering algorithm which is still a
difficult standard to beat in the field. In partic-
ular, they propose a monothetic clustering tech-
nique which merges base clusters with high string
overlap. Indeed, instead of using the classical Vec-
tor Space Model (VSM) representation, they pro-
pose to represent Web snippets as compact tries.

LINGO: (Osinski and Weiss, 2005) proposed a
polythetic solution called LINGO which takes into
account the string representation proposed by (Za-
mir and Etzioni, 1998). They first extract frequent
phrases based on suffix-arrays. Then, they reduce
the term-document matrix (defined as a VSM) us-
ing Single Value Decomposition to discover latent
structures. Finally, they match group descriptions
with the extracted topics and assign relevant doc-
uments to them.

OPTIMSRC: (Carpineto and Romano, 2010)
showed that the characteristics of the outputs re-
turned by PRC algorithms suggest the adoption of
a meta clustering approach. As such, they intro-
duce a novel criterion to measure the concordance
of two partitions of objects into different clusters
based on the information content associated to the
series of decisions made by the partitions on single
pairs of objects. Then, the meta clustering phase
is casted to an optimization problem of the concor-
dance between the clustering combination and the
given set of clusterings.

With respect to implementation, we used the
Carrot2 APIs4 which are freely available for STC,
LINGO and the classical BIK. It is worth notic-
ing that all implementations in Carrot2 are tuned
to extract exactly 10 clusters. For OPTIMSRC,
we reproduced the results presented in the paper
of (Carpineto and Romano, 2010) as no imple-
mentation is freely available. The results are il-
lustrated in Table 2 including both Fβ-measure
and Fb3 . They evidence clear improvements of
our methodology when compared to state-of-the-
art text-based PRC algorithms, over both datasets
and all evaluation metrics. But more important,
even when the p-context vector is small (p = 3),
the adapted GK-means outperforms all other ex-
isting text-based PRC which is particularly impor-
tant as they need to perform in real-time.

5 Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed a new PRC ap-
proach which (1) is based on the adaptation of
the K-means algorithm to third-order similar-
ity measures and (2) proposes a coherent stop-
ping criterion. Results evidenced clear improve-
ments over the evaluated state-of-the-art text-
based approaches for two gold standard datasets.
Moreover, our best F1-measure over ODP-239
(0.390) approximates the highest ever-reached F1-
measure (0.413) by the TOPICAL knowledge-
driven algorithm proposed in (Scaiella et al.,
2012)5. These results are promising and in future
works, we propose to define new knowledge-based
third-order similarity measures based on studies in
entity-linking (Ferragina and Scaiella, 2010).

though different results can be obtained for different Fβ-
measures and Fb3 as evidenced in Table 2.
