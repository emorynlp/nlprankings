Abstract

We study the problem of integrating scat-
tered online opinions. For this purpose,
we propose to exploit structured ontology
to obtain well-formed relevant aspects to
a topic and use them to organize scattered
opinions to generate a structured sum-
mary. Particularly, we focus on two main
challenges in implementing this idea, (1)
how to select the most useful aspects from
a large number of aspects in the ontology
and (2) how to order the selected aspects
to optimize the readability of the struc-
tured summary. We propose and explore
several methods for solving these chal-
lenges. Experimental results on two dif-
ferent data sets (US Presidents and Digital
Cameras) show that the proposed methods
are effective for selecting aspects that can
represent the major opinions and for gen-
erating coherent ordering of aspects.

1 Introduction
The explosive growth of online opinions raises in-
teresting challenges for opinion integration and
summarization. It is especially interesting to in-
tegrate and summarize scattered opinions in blog
articles and forums as they tend to represent the
general opinions of a large number of people and
get refreshed quickly as people dynamically gen-
erate new content, making them valuable for un-
derstanding the current views of a topic.

However, opinions in blogs and forums are
usually fragmental, scattered around, and buried
among other off-topic content, so it is quite chal-
lenging to organize them in a meaningful way.
Traditional text summarization techniques gener-
ate an unstructured list of sentences as a sum-
mary, which cannot reveal representative opinions

on different aspects of a topic or effectively facil-
itate navigation into the huge opinion space. To
address this limitation, recent work has shown the
usefulness of generating a structured summary of
opinions, in which related opinions are grouped
into topical aspects with explicit labeling of all the
aspects. A major challenge in producing such a
structured summary is how to generate these as-
pects for an arbitrary topic (e.g., products, politi-
cal ﬁgures, policies, etc.). Intuitively, the aspects
should be concise phrases that can both be easily
interpreted in the context of the topic under con-
sideration and capture the major opinions. How-
ever, where can we ﬁnd such phrases and which
phrases should we select as aspects? Furthermore,
once we selected aspects, how should we order
them to improve the readability of a structured
summary? One way to generate aspects is to clus-
ter all the opinion sentences and then identify rep-
resentative phrases in each cluster. Although as-
pects selected in this way can effectively capture
the major opinions, a major limitation is that it is
generally hard to ensure that the selected phrases
are well connected with the given topic (Chen and
Dumais, 2000).

In this paper, we propose a novel approach
to generating aspects by leveraging the ontolo-
gies with structured information that are available
online, such as open domain knowledge base in
Freebase1. Such kind of ontology data is not in
small scale by any measure. For example, Free-
base alone contains more than 10 million topics,
3000 types, and 30,000 properties; moreover, it is
constantly growing as people collaboratively con-
tribute. Freebase provides different properties for
different types of topics such as personal infor-
mation for a “US President” and product features
for a “Digital Camera”. Since this kind of re-
sources can provide related entities/relations for a

wide range of topics , our general idea is to lever-
age them as guidance for more informed organi-
zation of scattered online opinions, and in partic-
ular, to select the most important properties of a
topic from such structured ontology as aspects to
generate a structured opinion summary. A signif-
icant advantage of this approach to aspect genera-
tion is that the selected aspects are guaranteed to
be very well connected with the topic, but it also
raises an additional challenge in selecting the as-
pects to best capture the major opinions from a
large number of aspects provided for each topic in
the ontology. Different from some existing work
on exploiting ontologies, e.g., (Sauper and Barzi-
lay, 2009), which relies on training data, we focus
on exploring unsupervised approaches, which can
be applied to a larger scope of topics.

Speciﬁcally, given a topic with entries in an on-
tology and a collection of scattered online opin-
ions about the topic, our goal is to generate a
structured summary where representative major
opinions are organized with well aligned aspects
and in an order easy for human to follow. We
propose the following general approach: First, re-
trieval techniques are employed to align opinions
to relevant aspects. Second, a subset of most inter-
esting aspects are selected. Third, we will further
order the selected aspects to present them in a rea-
sonable order. Finally, for the opinions uncovered
by the selected aspects from the ontology, we use
a phrase ranking method to suggest new aspects to
add to the ontology for increasing its coverage.

Implementing the second and third steps in-
volves special challenges. In particular, without
any training data, it is unclear how we should
show the most interesting aspects in ontology with
major opinions aligned and which presentation
order of aspects is natural and intuitive for hu-
man. Solving these two challenges is the main
focus of this paper. We propose three meth-
ods for aspect selection, i.e., size-based, opinion
coverage-based, and conditional entropy-based
methods, and two methods for aspect ordering,
i.e., ontology-ordering and coherence ordering.
We evaluate our methods on two different types of
topics: US Presidents and Digital Cameras. Qual-
itative results demonstrate the utility of integrating
opinions based on structured ontology as well as

the generalizability of proposed methods. Quan-
titative evaluation is also conducted to show the
effectiveness of our methods.

Note that we use the term ”opinion” to broadly
refer to any discussion in opinionated sources
such as blogs and reviews. This allows us to for-
mulate and solve the problem in a general way.
Indeed, the main goal of our work is to extract
and organize the major opinions about a topic that
are buried in many scattered opinionated sources
rather than perform deeper understanding of opin-
ions (e.g., distinguishing positive from negative
opinions), which can be done by using any exist-
ing sentiment analysis technique as an orthogonal
post-processing step after applying our method.

2 Related Work
Aspect summarization,
i.e., structured opinion
summarization over topical aspects, has attracted
much attention recently. Existing work iden-
tiﬁes aspects using frequent-pattern/association-
rule mining, e.g. (Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and
Etzioni, 2005), sentence clustering, e.g.
(Ga-
mon et al., 2005; Leouski and Croft, 1996), or
topic modeling, e.g. (Mei et al., 2006; Titov and
McDonald, 2008). After that, meaningful and
prominent phrases need to be selected to repre-
sent the aspects, e.g. (Zhao and He, 2006; Mei
et al., 2007). However, these methods suffer from
the problem of producing trivial aspects. Conse-
quently, some of the aspects generated are very
difﬁcult to interpret (Chen and Dumais, 2000). In
this paper, we propose a different kind of approach
that is to use aspects provided by ontology which
are known to be relevant and easy to interpret.

Ontology is used in (Carenini et al., 2005) but
only for mapping product features. The closest
work to ours are (Lu and Zhai, 2008; Sauper and
Barzilay, 2009); both try to use well-written arti-
cles for summarization. However, (Lu and Zhai,
2008) assumes the well-written article is struc-
tured with explicit or implicit aspect information,
which does not always hold in practice, while
(Sauper and Barzilay, 2009) needs a relatively
large amount of training data in the given domain.
In comparison, our work only needs the ontology
information for the given topic which is much eas-
ier to obtain from resources such as Freebase.

3 Methods
Given (1) an input topic T , (2) a large number of
aspects/properties A = {A1, ..., Am} from an on-
tology that are related to T , and (3) a huge col-
lection of scattered opinion sentences about the
topic DT = {s1, . . . , sn}, our goal is to gener-
ate a structured organization of opinions that are
both aligned well with the interesting aspects and
representative of major opinions about the topic.
The envisioned structured organization consists
of a sequence of selected aspects from ontol-
ogy ordered to optimize readability and a set of
sentences matching each selected aspect. Once
we obtain a set of sentences in each aspect, we
can easily apply a standard text summarization
method to further summarize these sentences, thus
the unique challenges related to our main idea of
exploiting ontology are the following, which are
also the main focus of our study:
Aspect Selection: How can we select a subset of
aspects A0 ⊂ A to capture the major opinions in
our opinion set DT ?
Aspect Ordering: How can we order a subset of
selected aspects A0 so as to present them in an or-
der π(A0) that is most natural with respect to hu-
man perception?
New Aspects Suggestion: Can we exploit the
opinions in DT to suggest new aspects to be added
to the ontology?
3.1 Aspect Selection
In order to align the scattered opinions to the
most relevant aspects, we ﬁrst use each aspect la-
bel Ai ∈ A as a query to retrieve a set of rel-
evant opinions in the collection Si ⊆ DT with
a standard language modeling approach, i.e., the
KL-divergence retrieval model (Zhai and Lafferty,
2001). Up to 1000 opinion sentences are retrieved
for each aspect; each opinion sentence can be po-
tentially aligned to several aspects. In this way,
scattered online discussion are linked to the most
relevant aspects in the ontology, which enables a
user to use aspects as ”semantic bridges” to navi-
gate into the opinion space..

However, there are usually a lot of candidate
aspects in an ontology, and only some are heav-
ily commented in online discussions, so showing
all the aspects is not only unnecessary, but also
overwhelming for users. To solve this problem,

Intuitively,

we propose to utilize the aligned opinions to fur-
ther select a subset of the most interesting aspects
A0 ⊂ A with size k. Several approaches are pos-
sible for this subset selection problem.
the selected subset A0
Size-based:
should reﬂect the major opinions. So a straightfor-
ward method is to order the aspects Ai by the size
of the aligned opinion sentences Si, i.e., the num-
ber of relevant opinion sentences, and then select
the top k ones.
Opinion Coverage-based: The previous method
does not consider possible redundancy among the
aspects. A better approach is to select the subset
that covers as many distinct opinion sentences as
possible. This can be formulated as a maximum
coverage problem, for which a greedy algorithm
is known to be a good approximation: we select
one aspect at a time that is aligned with the largest
number of uncovered sentences.
Conditional Entropy-based: Aspects from a struc-
tured ontology are generally quite meaningful, but
they are not designed speciﬁcally for organizing
the opinions in our data set. Thus, they do not
necessarily correspond well to the natural clus-
ters in scattered opinions. To obtain aspects that
are aligned well with the natural clusters in scat-
tered opinions, we can ﬁrst cluster DT into l
clusters C = {C1, . . . , Cl} using K-means with
T F × IDF as features, and then choose the sub-
set of aspects that minimize Conditional Entropy
of the cluster label given the aspect:

A0 = arg min H(C|A0) = arg min
p(Ai, Ci) log

− XAi∈A0,Ci∈C

p(Ai, Ci)

p(Ai) 

This Conditional Entropy measures the uncer-
tainty about the cluster label of a sentence given
the knowledge of its aspect. Intuitively, if the as-
pects are aligned well with the clusters, we would
be able to predict well the cluster label of a sen-
tence if we know its aspect, thus there would be
less uncertainty about the cluster label.
In the
extreme case when the cluster label can be com-
pletely determined by the aspect, the conditional
entropy would reach its minimum (i.e., 0). Intu-
itively, the conditional entropy-based method es-
sentially selects the most appropriate aspects from

the ontology to label clusters of opinions.
The exact solution of this combinatorial optimiza-
tion problem is NP-complete, so we employ a
polynomial time greedy algorithm to approximate
it: in the i-th iteration, we select the aspect that
can minimize the conditional entropy given the
previous i − 1 selected aspects. Pseudo code is
given in Algorithm 1.
3.2 Aspect Ordering
In order to present the selected aspects to users
in a most natural way, it is important to obtain a
coherent order of them, i.e., generating an order
consistent with human perception. To achieve this
goal, our idea is to use human written articles on
the topic to learn how to organize the aspects au-
tomatically. Speciﬁcally, we would order aspects
so that the relative order of the sentences in all the
aspects would be as consistent with their order in
the original online discussions as possible.

Formally, the input is a subset of selected as-
pects A0; each Ai ∈ A0 is aligned with a set of
relevant opinion sentences Si = {Si,1, Si,2, ...}.
We deﬁne a coherence measurement function over
sentence pairs Co(Si,k, Sj,l), which is set to 1 iff
Si,k appears before Sj,l in the same article. Other-
wise, it is set to 0. Then a coherence measurement
function over an aspect pair can be calculated as

Co(Ai, Aj) = PSi,k∈Si,Sj,l∈Sj Co(Si,k, Sj,l)

|Si||Sj|

As an output, we would like to ﬁnd a permutation
ˆπ(A0) that maximizes the coherence of all pair-
wise aspects, i.e.,

ˆπ(A0) = arg max

π(A0) XAi,Aj∈A0,Ai≺Aj

Co(Ai, Aj)

Ai.coherence = 0
for each aspect Aj in π(A) do
Ai.coherence+ = Co(Aj, Ai)
for each aspect Aj in A, j 6= i do
Ai.coherence+ = Co(Ai, Aj)
if Ai.coherence > M ax.coherence then

remove M ax from A; add M ax to π(A)

where Ai ≺ Aj means that Ai is before Aj. It
is easy to prove that the problem is NP-complete.
Therefore, we resort to greedy algorithms to ﬁnd
approximations of the solution. Particularly we
view the problem as a ranking problem. The al-
gorithm proceeds by ﬁnding at each ranking po-
sition an aspect that can maximize the coherence
measurement, starting from the top of the rank list.
The detailed algorithm is given in Algorithm 2.
3.3 New Aspects Suggestion
Finally, if the opinions cover more aspects than in
the ontology, we also want to identify informative
phrases to label such extra aspects; such phrases
can also be used to further augment the ontology
with new aspects.

This problem is similar to existing work on gen-
erating labels for clusters (Zeng et al., 2004) or
topic models (Mei et al., 2007). Here we employ
a simple but representative technique to demon-
strate the feasibility of discovering interesting new
aspects for augmenting the ontology. We ﬁrst ex-
tract named entities from scattered opinions DT
using Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel
et al., 2005). After that, we rank the phrases by
pointwise Mutual Information (MI):

M I(T, ph) = log

P (T, ph)

P (T )P (ph)

where T is the given topic and ph refers to a candi-
date entity phrase. P (T, ph) is proportional to the
number of opinion sentences they co-occur; P (T )
or P (ph) are proportional to the number of times
T or ph appears. A higher M I value indicates a

4 Experiments
4.1 Data Sets
To examine the generalizability of our methods,
we test on two very different categories of top-
ics: US Presidents and Digital Cameras.2 For the
ontology, we leverage Freebase, downloading the
structured ontology for each topic. For the opin-
ion corpus, we use blog data for US Presidents and
customer reviews for Digital Cameras. The blog
entries for US Presidents were collected by using
Google Blog Search3 with the name of a president
as the query. Customer reviews for Digital Cam-
eras were crawled from CNET4. The basic statis-
tics of our data sets is shown in Table 1. For all the
data collections, Porter stemmer (Porter, 1997) is
applied and stop words are removed.
4.2 Sample Results
We ﬁrst show sample results of automatic orga-
nization of online opinions. We use the opin-
ion coverage-based algorithm to select 10 aspects
(10-20 aspects were found to be optimal in (K¨aki,
2005)) and then apply the coherence-based aspect
ordering method. The number of clusters is set so
that there are on average 15 opinions per cluster.
Opinion Organization: Table 2 and Table 3
present sample results for President Ronald Rea-
gan and Sony Cybershot DSC-W200 camera re-
spectively5. We can see that (1) although Freebase
aspects provide objective and accurate informa-
tion about the given topics, extracted opinion sen-
tences offer additional subjective information; (2)
aligning scattered opinion sentences to most rel-
evant aspects in the ontology helps digestion and

navigation; and (3) the support number, which is
the number of opinion sentences aligned to an as-
pect, can show the popularity of the aspect in the
online discussions.
Adaptability of Aspect Selection: Being un-
supervised is a signiﬁcant advantage of our meth-
ods over most existing work. It provides ﬂexibil-
ity of applying the methods in different domains
without the requirement of training data, beneﬁt-
ing from both the ontology based template guid-
ance as well as data-driven approaches. As a re-
sult, we can generate different results for differ-
ent topics even in the same domain. In Table 4,
we show the top three selected and ordered as-
pects for Abraham Lincoln and Richard Nixon.
Although they belong to the same category, differ-
ent aspects are picked up due to the differences in
online opinions. People talk a lot about Lincoln’s
role in American Civil War and his famous quo-
tation, but when talking about Nixon, people fo-
cus on ending the Vietnam war and the Watergate
scandal. “Date of birth” and “Government posi-
tion” are ranked ﬁrst because people tend to start
talking from these aspects, which is more natural
than starting from aspects like “Place of death”.
Baseline Comparison: We also show below the
aspects for Lincoln generated by a representative
approach using clustering method (e.g. (Gamon et
al., 2005)). i.e., we label the largest clusters by se-
lecting phrases with top mutual information. We
can see that although some phrases make sense,
not all are well connected with the given topic;
using aspects in ontology circumvents this prob-
lem. This example conﬁrms the ﬁnding in pre-
vious work that the popular existing clustering-
based approach to aspects generation cannot gen-
erate meaningful labels (Chen and Dumais, 2000).

4.3 Evaluation of Aspect Selection
Measures: Aspect selection is a new challenge,
so there is no standard way to evaluate it. It is also
very hard for human to read all of the aspects and
opinions and then select a gold standard subset.
Therefore, we opt to use indirect measures captur-
ing different characteristics of the aspect selection
problem (1) Aspect Coverage (AC): we ﬁrst as-
sign each aspect Ai to the cluster Cj that has the
most overlapping sentences with Ai, approximat-
ing the cluster that would come into mind when
a reader sees Ai. Then AC is deﬁned as the per-
centage of the clusters covered by at least one as-
pect.
(2) Aspect Precision (AP ): for each cov-
ered cluster Ci, AP measures the Jaccard similar-
ity between Ci as a set of opinions and the union
of all aspects assigned to Ci. (3) Average Aspect
Precision (AAP ): deﬁnes averaged AP for all
clusters where an uncovered Ci has a zero AP ;
it essentially combines AC and AP . We also re-
port Sentence Coverage (SC), i.e., how many dis-
tinct opinion sentences can be covered by the se-
lected aspects and Conditional Entropy (H), i.e.,
how well the selected aspects align with the nat-
ural clusters in the opinions; a smaller H value
indicates a better alignment.

opinion coverage-based approach has the best
sentence coverage (SC) performance and condi-
tional entropy-based greedy algorithm achieves
the lowest H. Size-based approach is best in as-
pect precision but at the cost of lowest aspect cov-
erage. The trade-off between AP and AC is com-
parable to that between precision and recall as
in information retrieval while AAP summarizes
the combination of these two. The greedy algo-
rithm based on conditional entropy outperforms
all other approaches in AC and also in AAP , sug-
gesting that it can provide a good balance between
AP and AC.

4.4 Evaluation of Aspect Ordering

Human Annotation: In order to quantitatively
evaluate the effectiveness of aspect ordering, we
conduct user studies to establish gold standard or-
dering. Three users were each given k selected as-
pects and asked to perform two tasks for each US
President: (1) identify clusters of aspects that are
more natural to be presented together (cluster con-
straints) and (2) identify aspect pairs where one
aspect is preferred to appear before the other from
the viewpoint of readability. (order constraints).
We did not ask them to provide a full order of
the k aspects, because we suspect that there are
usually more than one “perfect” order.
Instead,
identifying partial orders or constraints is easier
for human to perform, thus provides more robust
gold standard.
Human Agreement: After obtaining the human
annotation results, we ﬁrst study human consen-
sus on the ordering task. For both types of human
identiﬁed constraints, we convert them into pair-
wise relations of aspects, e.g., “Ai and Aj should
be presented together” or “Ai should be displayed
before Aj”. Then we calculate the agreement per-
centage among the three users. In Table 7, we can
see that only a very small percentage of pair-wise
partial orders (15.92% of the cluster constraints
and none of the order constraints) are agreed by
all the three users, though the agreement of clus-
tering is much higher than that of ordering. This
indicates that ordering the aspects is a subjective
and difﬁcult task.
Measures: Given the human generated gold stan-
dard of partial constraints, we use the follow-
ing measures to evaluate the automatically gen-

the system output. (2) Cluster Penalty (pc): for
each aspect pair placed in the same cluster by hu-
man, we give a linear penalty proportional to the
number of aspects in between the pair that the
system places; pc can be interpreted as the aver-
age number of aspects between aspect pairs that
should be presented together in the case of mis-
ordering. Smaller penalty corresponds to better
ordering performance. (3) Order Precision (pro):
the percentage of correctly predicted aspect pairs
compared with human speciﬁed order.

the ordering
performance based on two selection algorithms:
opinion coverage-based and conditional entropy-
based. Different selection algorithms provide dif-
ferent subsets of aspects for the ordering algo-
rithms to operate on. For comparison with our
coherence-based ordering algorithm, we include a
random baseline and Freebase ontology ordering.
Note that Freebase order is a very strong baseline
because it is edited by human even though the pur-
pose was not for organizing opinions. To take into
account the variation of human annotation, we use
four versions of gold standard: three are from the
individual annotators and one from the union of
their annotation. We did not include the gold stan-

Table 8: Evaluation Results on Aspect Ordering

dard that is the intersection of three annotators be-
cause that would leave us with too little overlap.
We have several observations: (1) In general, re-
sults show large variations when using different
versions of gold standard, indicating the subjec-
tive nature of the ordering task. (2) Coherence-
based ordering shows similar performance to
Freebase order-based in cluster precision (prc),
but when we take into consideration the distance-
based penalty (pc) of separating aspects pairs in
the same cluster, coherence-based ordering is al-
most always signiﬁcantly better except in one
case. This shows that our method can effectively
learn the coherence of aspects based on how their
aligned opinion sentences are presented in online
discussions. (3) Order precision (pro) can hardly
distinguish different ordering algorithm. This in-
dicates that people vary a lot in their preferences
as which aspects should be presented ﬁrst. How-
ever, in cases when the random baseline outper-
forms others the margin is fairly small, while
Freebase order and coherence-based order have a
much larger margin of improvement when show-
ing superior performance.

5 Conclusions and Future Work

A major challenge in automatic integration of
scattered online opinions is how to organize all
the diverse opinions in a meaningful way for any
given topic. In this paper, we propose to solve this
challenge by exploiting related aspects in struc-
tured ontology which are guaranteed to be mean-
ingful and well connected to the topic. We pro-
posed three different methods for selecting a sub-
set of aspects from the ontology that can best
capture the major opinions, including size-based,
opinion coverage-based, and conditional entropy-
based methods. We also explored two ways to
order aspects, i.e., ontology-order and coherence

optimization. In addition, we also proposed ap-
propriate measures for quantitative evaluation of
both aspect selection and ordering.

Experimental evaluation on two data sets (US
President and Digital Cameras) shows that by ex-
ploiting structured ontology, we can generate in-
teresting aspects to organize scattered opinions.
The conditional entropy method is shown to be
most effective for aspect selection, and the coher-
ence optimization method is more effective than
ontology-order in optimizing the coherence of the
aspect ordering, though ontology-order also ap-
pears to perform reasonably well. In addition, by
extracting salient phrases from the major opinions
that cannot be covered well by any aspect in an
existing ontology, we can also discover interest-
ing new aspects to extend the existing ontology.

Complementary with most existing summariza-
tion work, this work proposes a new direction of
using structured information to organize and sum-
marize unstructured opinions, opening up many
interesting future research directions.
For in-
stance, in order to focus on studying aspect selec-
tion and ordering, we have not tried to optimize
sentences matching with aspects in the ontology;
it would be very interesting to further study how
to accurately retrieve sentences matching each as-
pect. Another promising future work is to orga-
nize opinions using both structured ontology in-
formation and well-written overview articles.
