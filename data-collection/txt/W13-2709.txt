Abstract

Manually assigned keywords provide a
valuable means for accessing large docu-
ment collections. They can serve as a shal-
low document summary and enable more
efficient retrieval and aggregation of infor-
mation. In this paper we investigate key-
words in the context of the Dutch Folk-
tale Database, a large collection of stories
including fairy tales, jokes and urban leg-
ends. We carry out a quantitative and qual-
itative analysis of the keywords in the col-
lection. Up to 80% of the assigned key-
words (or a minor variation) appear in the
text itself. Human annotators show moder-
ate to substantial agreement in their judg-
ment of keywords. Finally, we evaluate a
learning to rank approach to extract and
rank keyword candidates. We conclude
that this is a promising approach to auto-
mate this time intensive task.

1 Introduction

Keywords are frequently used as a simple way
to provide descriptive metadata about collections
of documents. A set of keywords can concisely
present the most important aspects of a document
and enable quick summaries of multiple docu-
ments. The word cloud in Figure 1, for instance,
gives a quick impression of the most important
topics in a collection of over 40,000 documents (a
collection of Dutch folktales).

Keyword assignment or generation is the task
of finding the most important, topical keywords or
keyphrases to describe a document (Turney, 2000;
Frank et al., 1999). Based on keywords, small
groups of documents (Hammouda et al., 2005) or
large collections of documents (Park et al., 2002)
can be summarized. Keyword extraction is a re-
stricted case of keyword assignment: the assigned

keywords are a selection of the words or phrases
appearing in the document itself (Turney, 2000;
Frank et al., 1999).

In this paper we look into keyword extraction
in the domain of cultural heritage, in particular
for extracting keywords from folktale narratives
found in the Dutch Folktale Database (more on
this collection in section 3). These narratives
might require a different approach for extraction
than in other domains, such as news stories and
scholarly articles (Jiang et al., 2009). Stories in the
Dutch Folktale Database are annotated with un-
controlled, free-text, keywords. Because suggest-
ing keywords which do not appear in the text is a
considerably harder task to automate and to eval-
uate, we restrict ourselves to keywords extracted
from the text itself.

In the first part of this paper we study the cur-
rent practice of keyword assignment for this col-
lection. We analyze the assigned keywords in the
collection as a whole and present a more fine-
grained analysis of a sample of documents. More-
over, we investigate to what extent human anno-
tators agree on suitable keywords extracted from
the text. Manually assigning keywords is an ex-
pensive and time-consuming process. Automatic
assignment would bring down the cost and time to
archive material. In the second part of this paper
we evaluate a number of automatic keyword ex-
traction methods. We show that a learning to rank
approach gives promising results.

The overview of this paper is as follows. We
first describe related work in automatic keyword
assignment. In section 3 we introduce the Dutch
Folktale Database. In section 4 we present an anal-
ysis of the keywords currently used in the folktale
database. In section 5 we investigate the agree-
ment of human annotators on keyword extraction.
In section 6 we present and evaluate an automatic
method for extracting and ranking keywords. We
end with a discussion and conclusion in section 7.

2 Related Work

Because of space limitations, we limit our dis-
cussion of related work to keyword extraction in
the context of free-text indexing. Automated con-
trolled vocabulary indexing is a fundamentally
different task (see for instance Medelyan and Wit-
ten (2006) and Plaunt and Norgard (1998)).

Typically, keyword extraction consists of two
steps. In the first step candidate keywords are de-
termined and features, such as the frequency or
position in the document, are calculated to char-
acterize these keywords. In the second step the
candidates are filtered and ranked based on these
features. Both unsupervised and supervised algo-
rithms have been used to do this.

2.1 Candidate Extraction
Candidate keywords can be extracted in a number
of ways. The simplest approach is to treat each
single word as a candidate keyword, optionally
filtering out stop words or only selecting words
with a particular Part-of-Speech (Liu et al., 2009a;
Jiang et al., 2009). More sophisticated approaches
allow for multi-word keywords, by extracting con-
secutive words from the text, optionally limited to
keywords adhering to specific lexical patterns (Os-
inski and Weiss, 2005; Hulth, 2003; Rose et al.,
2010; Frank et al., 1999; Turney, 2000).

2.2 Features to Characterize Keywords
Many features for characterizing candidate key-
words have been investigated previously, with
varying computational complexities and resource
requirements. The simplest features are based
on document and collection statistics, for instance

the frequency of a potential keyword in the doc-
ument and the inverse document frequency in the
collection (Turney, 2000; Hulth, 2003; Frank et
al., 1999). Examples of more complex features
are: features based on characteristics of lexical
chains, requiring a lexical database with word
meanings (Ercan and Cicekli, 2007); features re-
lated to frequencies in external document collec-
tions and query logs (Bendersky and Croft, 2008;
Yih et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2009b; Xu et al., 2010);
and a feature to determine the cohesiveness of re-
trieved documents with that keyword (Bendersky
and Croft, 2008).

2.3 Unsupervised Methods for Keyword
Extraction

Unsupervised methods for keyword extraction
typically rely on heuristics to filter and rank the
keywords in order of importance. For instance,
by ranking the candidates by their importance in
the collection – estimated by the inverse docu-
ment frequency. Another approach is to apply the
PageRank algorithm to determine the most impor-
tant keywords based on their co-occurrence link-
structure (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). Liu et al.
(2009b) employed clustering to extract keywords
that cover all important topics from the original
text. From each topic cluster an exemplar is deter-
mined and for each exemplar the best correspond-
ing keyword is determined.

2.4 Supervised Methods for Keyword
Extraction

Early supervised methods used training data to set
the optimal parameters for (unsupervised) systems

66



based on heuristics (Turney, 2000). Other methods
approached keyword extraction as a binary classi-
fication problem: given a candidate keyword it has
to be classified as either a keyword or not. Meth-
ods include decision trees (Bendersky and Croft,
2008), Naive Bayes (Frank et al., 1999) and Sup-
port Vector Machines (Zhang et al., 2006). Zhang
et al. (2008) approached keyword extraction as a
labeling problem for which they employed condi-
tional random fields. Recently, keyword extrac-
tion has been cast as a ranking problem and learn-
ing to rank techniques have been applied to solve
it (Jiang et al., 2009). Jiang et al. (2009) concluded
that learning to rank approaches performed better
than binary classifiers in the context of extracting
keywords from scholarly texts and websites. Dif-
ferent variations of learning to rank exist, see (Li,
2011) for an overview.

3 The Dutch Folktale Database

The Dutch Folktale Database is a repository of
over 40,000 folktales in Dutch, old Dutch, Frisian
and a large number of Dutch dialects. The mate-
rial has been collected in the 19th, 20th and 21th
centuries, and consists of stories from various pe-
riods, including the Middle Ages and the Renais-
sance. The collection has both an archival and a
research function. It preserves an important part
of the oral cultural heritage of the Netherlands and
can be used for comparative folk narrative studies.
Since 2004 the database is available online1.

The real value of the database does not only lie
the stories themselves, but also in their manually
added set of descriptive metadata fields. These
fields include, for example, a summary in Dutch,
a list of proper names present in the folktales, and
a list of keywords. Adding these metadata is a
time-consuming and demanding task. In fact, the
amount of work involved hampers the growth of
the folktale database. A large backlog of digitized
folktales is awaiting metadata assignment before
they can be archived in the collection. Being able
to automatically assign keywords to these docu-
ments would be a first step to speed up the archiv-
ing process.

4 Analysis of Assigned Keywords

In this section we analyze the keywords that have
been manually assigned to the stories in the Dutch
Folktale Database. First we look at the keywords

assigned to the collection as a whole. After that we
make a more fine-grained analysis of the keywords
assigned to a selection of the documents.

4.1 Quantitative Analysis

We analyzed a snapshot from the Dutch Folktale
Database (from early 2012) that consists of 41,336
folktales. On average, 15 keywords have been as-
signed to each of these documents (see Figure 2).
The median number of assigned keywords is 10,
however. The keywords vocabulary has 43,195
unique keywords, most of which consist of a sin-
gle word (90%). Figure 1 shows a word cloud
of keywords used in the collection; more frequent
keyword types appear larger. On the right, it lists
the most frequent keyword types (and their trans-
lations). The assignment of keywords to docu-
ments has a Zipfian distribution: a few keyword
types are assigned to many documents, whereas
many keyword types are assigned to few docu-
ments.

When we limit our collection to stories in Dutch
(15,147 documents), we can determine how many
of the manually assigned keywords can be found
literally in the story text2. We define the keyword
coverage of a document as the fraction of its as-
signed keywords which is found in the full text
or its summary. The average keyword coverage
of the Dutch stories is 65%. Figure 3 shows a
histogram of the coverage. It shows that most of
the documents have a keyword coverage of 0.5 or
more.

4.2 Qualitative Analysis

The quantitative analysis does not provide insight
into what kind of keywords have been assigned.
Therefore, we analyzed a selection of documents
more thoroughly. For each of the five largest gen-
res in the collection (fairy tale, traditional legend,
joke, urban legend and riddle) we sampled 10 tales
and manually classified the keywords assigned to
these folktales. A total of almost 1000 keywords
was analyzed. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of
this analysis. Almost 80% of the keywords appear
literally or almost literally in the text. The almost
literal appearances include keywords which differ
in quantity (plural versus singular form) and verb
forms. Verb forms vary in tense (present rather
than past tense) and infinitive keywords of sepa-
rable verbs. An example of the latter is the as-
signment of the keyword “terugkeren”, to return,
where “keren” (∼ turn) and “terug” (∼ back) are
used in a sentence. Of the analyzed keywords
5% are synonyms of words appearing the text and
2.3% are hypernyms of words appearing the text
(e.g. “wapen”, weapon, is used as a keyword with
“mes”, knife, mentioned in the text). The remain-
ing 13% of the keywords represent abstract topic,
event and activity descriptions. For example, the
keyword “wegsturen”, to send away, when one of
the characters explicitly asks someone to leave.
Other examples are the keywords “baan”, job, and
“arbeid”, labor, when the story is about an unem-
ployed person.

Based on these numbers we can conclude that
based on extraction techniques alone we should
be able to reproduce a large portion of the manual
keyword assignment. When thesauri are employed
to find synonyms and hypernyms, up to 87% of the
manually assigned keywords could be found. A
much harder task is to obtain the remaining 13%

5 Evaluating Agreement in Keyword
Assignment

The previous analyses raise the question whether
the keywords have been consistently assigned: do
annotators choose the same keywords when pre-
sented with the same text? Moreover, knowing
the difficulty of the task for human annotators will
give us an indication of the level of performance
we may expect from automatic keyword assign-
ment. To determine the agreement between an-
notators we asked ten annotators to classify the
vocabulary of five folktales from different genres.
Frog3 (van den Bosch et al., 2007) was used to
extract the vocabulary of lemmas. After carefully
reading a folktale, the annotator classified the al-
phabetically sorted list of lemmas extracted from
the text. Each lemma was classified as either: 1)
not a relevant keyword – should not be assigned
to this document (non); 2) a relevant keyword –
should be assigned (rel); 3) a highly relevant key-
word – should definitely be assigned (hrel). The
three levels of relevance were used to see whether
annotators have a preference for certain keywords.
The pairwise agreement between annotators was
measured using Cohen’s kappa. Each document
was judged twice, totaling a set of 25 documents.
Most of the annotators were familiar with the folk-
tale database and its keywords; two were active
contributors to the database and thus had previous
experience in assigning keywords to folktales.

On average, the annotators judged 79% of the
vocabulary as non-relevant as keywords. 9% and
12% of the vocabulary was judged as relevant and
highly relevant respectively, but there was a large
variation in these percentages: some annotators
assigned more highly relevant keywords, others
assigned more relevant keywords.

Table 2: Classification agreement between annota-
tors. Non: non-relevant, rel: relevant, hrel: highly
relevant.

The two experienced annotators showed a con-
sistently higher average agreement in comparison
to the other annotators (0.56 and 0.50 for non, rel,
hrel; 0.7 and 0.64 for non, rel + hrel; 0.56 and 0.50
for non + rel, hrel). Moreover, they assigned more
(relevant and highly relevant) keywords to the doc-
uments on average.

Table 2 summarizes the agreement measured
between annotators. The first row indicates the
agreement when considering agreement over all
three classes; the second row indicates the agree-
ment when treating relevant and highly relevant
keywords as the same class; the last row shows
the agreement in indicating the same highly rel-
evant keywords. The numbers indicate moder-
ate agreement between annotators over all three
classes and when considering the choice of highly
relevant keywords. Annotators show substantial
agreement on deciding between non-relevant and
relevant keywords. Table 3 shows the agreement
between annotators on keywords with different
parts of speech (CGN4 tagset). Most disagree-
ments are on nouns, adjectives and verbs. Verbs
and adjectives show few agreements on relevant
and highly relevant keywords. In contrast, on
20% of the nouns annotators agree on their rele-
vance. It appears that the annotators do not agree
whether adjectives and verbs should be used as
keywords at all. We can give three other reasons
why annotators did not agree. First, for longer
stories annotators were presented with long lists
of candidate keywords. Sometimes relevant key-
words might have been simply overlooked. Sec-
ond, it turned out that some annotators selected
some keywords in favor to other keywords (for in-
stance a hyponym rather than a hypernym), where
others simply annotated both as relevant. Third,
the disagreement can be explained by lack of de-
tailed instructions. The annotators were not told
how many (highly) relevant keywords to select or

4Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (Spoken Dutch Corpus),
http://lands.let.kun.nl/cgn/ehome.htm

what criteria should be met by the keywords. Such
instructions are not available to current annotators
of the collection either.

We conclude that annotators typically agree on
the keywords from a text, but have a varying
notion of highly relevant keywords. The aver-
age keywords-based representation strongly con-
denses the documents vocabulary: a document can
be represented by a fifth (21%) of its vocabulary5.
This value can be used as a cut-off point for meth-
ods ranking extracted keywords, discussed here-
after.

6 Automatically Extracting Keywords

In the last part of this paper we look into automati-
cally extracting keywords. We compare a learning
to rank classifier to baselines based on frequency
and reuse in their ability to reproduce keywords
found in manually classified folktales.

In all cases we use the same method for extract-
ing keyword candidates. Since most of the manual
keywords are single words (90% of the used key-
word types in the collection), we simply extract
single words as keyword candidates. We use Frog
for tokenization and part of speech tagging. Stop
words are not removed.

6.1 Baseline Systems

We use a basic unsupervised baseline for keyword
extraction: the words are ranked according to de-
scending TF-IDF. We refer to this system as TF-
IDF. TF, term frequency, and IDF, inverse docu-
ment frequency, are indicators of the term’s local
and global importance and are frequently used in
information retrieval to indicate the relative impor-
tance of a word (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
2011).

Note that a word appearing once in the collec-
tion has the highest IDF score. This would imply
that the most uncommon words are also the most
important resulting in a bias towards spelling er-
rors, proper names, and other uncommon words.
Hence, our second baseline takes into account
whether a keyword has been used before in a train-
ing set. Again, the candidates are ranked by de-
scending TF-IDF, but now keywords appearing in
the training collection are ranked above the key-
words not appearing in the collection. We refer to
this baseline as TF-IDF-T.

lary is judged as relevant and 12% as highly relevant

are column-wise percentages. Tags with full agreement are not shown.

6.2 Learning to Rank Keywords
Following Jiang et al. (2009) we apply a learn-
ing to rank technique to rank the list of extracted
keywords. We train an SVM to classify the rel-
ative ordering of pairs of keywords. Words cor-
responding to manual keywords should be ranked
higher than other words appearing in the docu-
ment. We use SVM-rank to train a linear ranking
SVM (Joachims, 2006). We use the following fea-
tures.

6.2.1 Word Context
We use the following word context features:
starts uppercase: indicates whether the token
starts with an uppercase letter (1) or not (0). Since
proper names are not used as keywords in the folk-
tale database, this feature is expected to be a neg-
ative indicator of a word being a keyword.
contains space: indicates whether the token con-
tains a space (Frog extracts some Dutch multi-
word phrases as a single token). Tokens with
spaces are not very common.
is number: indicates whether the token consists
of only digits. Numbers are expected not to be a
keyword.
contains letters: indicates whether the token con-
tains at least a single letter. Keywords are expected
to contain letters.
all capital letters: indicates whether the token
consists of only capital letters. Words with only
capital letters are not expected to be keywords.
single letter: indicates whether the token consists
of only one letter. One letter keywords are very
uncommon.
contains punctuation: indicates whether the to-
ken contains punctuation such as apostrophes.
Keywords are expected not to contain punctuation.
part of speech: indicates the part of speech of
the token (each tag is a binary feature). Nouns
are expected to be a positive indicator of key-
words (Jiang et al., 2009).

6.2.2 Document Context
We use the following document context features:
tf: the term frequency indicates the number of ap-
pearances of the word divided by the total number
of tokens in the document.
first offset: indicates the offset of the word’s
first appearance in the document, normalized by
the number of tokens in the document (follow-
ing Zhang et al. (2008)). Important (key)words are
expected to be mentioned early.
first sentence offset: indicates the offset of the
first sentence in which the token appears, normal-
ized by the number of sentences in the document.
sentence importance: indicates the maxi-
mum importance of a sentence in which the
word appears, as measured by the SumBasic
score (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005). Sum-
Basic determines the relative importance of sen-
tences solely on word probability distributions in
the text.
dispersion: indicates the dispersion or scattering
of the word in the document. Words which are
highly dispersed are expected to be more impor-
tant. The DPnorm is used as a dispersion measure,
proposed in Gries (2008).

6.2.3 Collection Context
We use the following features from the collec-
tion/training context:
idf: the inverse document frequency indicates the
collection importance of the word based on fre-
quency: frequent terms in the collection are less
important than rare terms in the collection.
tf.idf: combines the tf and idf features by multi-
plying them. It indicates a trade-off between local
and global word importance.
is training keyword: indicates whether the word
is used in the training collection as a keyword.
assignment ratio: indicates the percentage of
documents in which the term is present in the text
and in which it is also assigned as a keyword.

6.3 Evaluation Method

We evaluate the ranking methods on their ability
to reproduce the manual assignment of keywords.
Ideally the ranking methods rank these manual
keywords highest. We measure the effectiveness
of ranking in terms of (mean) average precision
(MAP), precision at rank 5 (P@5) and precision at
rank R (P@R), similar to Jiang et al. (2009). Note
that we use all the manually assigned keywords
as a ground truth, including words which do not
occur in the text itself. This lowers the highest
achievable performance, but it will give a better
idea of the performance for the real task.

We perform a 10-fold stratified cross-validation
with a set of 10,900 documents from the Dutch
Folktale Database, all written in modern Dutch.

6.4 Results

Table 4 lists the performance of the three tested
systems. The TF-IDF system performs worst,
and is significantly outperformed by the TF-IDF-
T system, which in turn is significantly outper-
formed by the rank-SVM system. On average,
rank-SVM returns 3 relevant keywords in its top
5. The reported mean average precision values
are affected by manual keywords which are not
present in the text itself. To put these numbers
in perspective: if we would put the manual key-
words which are in the text in an optimal ranking,
i.e. return these keywords first, we would achieve
an upper bound mean average precision of 0.5675.
Taking into account the likelihood that some of
the highly ranked false positives are relevant af-
ter all (the annotator might have missed a relevant
keyword) and considering the difficulty of the task
(given the variation in agreement between manual
annotators), we argue that the rank-SVM performs
quite well.

Jiang et al. (2009) reported MAPs of 0.288 and
0.503 on the ranking of extracted keyphrases from
scholarly articles and tags from websites respec-
tively. Based on these numbers, we could argue
that assigning keywords to folktales is harder than
reproducing the tags of websites, and slightly eas-
ier than reproducing keyphrases from scientific ar-
ticles. Because of differences in the experimental
setup (e.g. size of the training set, features and
system used), it is difficult to make strong claims
on the difficulty of the task.

6.5 Feature Ablation

To determine the added value of the individual fea-
tures we carried out an ablation study. Table 5
lists the changes in performance when leaving out
a particular feature (or group of features in case
of part of speech). It turns out that many features
can be left out without hurting the performance.
All the features testing simple word characteristics
(such as single letter) do not, or only marginally
influence the results. Also taking into account the

Table 7: SVM performance split according to
story genre. Values in bold are significantly dif-
ferent from the results on the other genres (inde-
pendent t-test, p-value < 0.01)

These observations suggest that almost identi-
cal results can be obtained using only the features
assignment ratio, tf.idf, part of speech and disper-
sion. The results reported in Table 6 confirm this
(we do note that these results were obtained by op-
timizing on the test set).

6.6 Performance on Folktale Genres

The folktale database contains stories from differ-
ent folktale genres, varying from legends to fairy
tales and jokes. Table 7 lists the performance mea-
sures per story genre. Values in bold indicate sig-
nificant differences with the stories from the other
genres combined. The performance on traditional
legends turns out to be significantly better than
other genres: this could be explained by the fact
that on average these stories are longer and there-
fore contain more keywords. Similarly, the de-
crease can be explained for jokes, which are much
shorter on average. Another explanation could be
that more abstract keywords are used to indicate
the type of joke. Interestingly, the riddles, which
are even shorter than jokes, do not perform sig-
nificantly worse than the other genres. Personal
narratives also underperformed in comparison to
the other genres. We cannot readily explain this,
but we suspect it may have something to do with
the fact that personal narratives are more varied in
content and contain more proper names.

7 Discussion and Conclusion

In this work we analyzed keywords in the context
of the Dutch Folktale Database. In this database,
on average 15 keywords have been assigned to a
story, many of which are single keywords which
appear literally or almost literally in the text itself.

Keyword annotators show moderate to substantial
agreement in extracting the same keywords for a
story. We showed that a learning to rank method
using features based on assignment ratio, tf.idf,
part of speech and dispersion can be effectively
used to extract and rank keyword candidates. We
believe that this system can be used to suggest
highly relevant keyword candidates to human an-
notators to speed up the archiving process.

In our evaluation we aimed to reproduce the
manual annotations, but it is unclear whether bet-
ter performing systems are actually more helpful
to the user. In an ad hoc retrieval scenario, in
which the user issues a single query and reviews
a list of retrieved documents, extracted keywords
might be used to boost the early precision of the
results. However, a user might not even notice
a difference when a different keyword extraction
system is used. Moreover, the more abstract key-
words which do not appear in the text might be
more important for the user experience. In fu-
ture work we want to get insight in how keywords
contribute to the end user experience. Ideally, the
evaluation should directly measure how useful the
various keywords are for accessing the collection.

In this work we considered only extracting key-
words from the text we want to annotate. Given
the multilingual content of the database this is a
limited approach: if the goal of assigning key-
words is to obtain a normalized representation of
the stories, this approach will require translation
of either the source text (before extraction) or the
extracted keywords. Even in the monolingual sce-
nario, the extraction of keywords is limited in deal-
ing with differences in style and word use. Writers
may use different words or use words in a differ-
ent way; ideally the representation based on key-
words is a normalized representation which closes
this semantic gap. In future work we will look into
annotation with keywords from multi-lingual the-
sauri combined with free-text keywords extracted
from the text itself. Finally, we want to look into
classification of abstract themes and topics.
