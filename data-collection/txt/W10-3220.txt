Abstract 
 

We develop a grammar for Urdu in 

Grammatical Framework (GF). GF is a 

programming language for defining 

multilingual grammar applications. GF 

resource grammar library currently 

supports 16 languages. These grammars 

follow an Interlingua approach and 

consist of morphology and syntax 

modules that cover a wide range of 

features of a language. In this paper we 

explore different syntactic features of the 

Urdu language, and show how to fit them 

in the multilingual framework of GF. We 

also discuss how we cover some of the 

distinguishing features of Urdu such as, 

ergativity in verb agreement (see Sec 

4.2).  The main purpose of GF resource 

grammar library is to provide an easy 

way to write natural language 

applications without knowing the details 

of syntax, morphology and lexicon. To 

demonstrate it, we use Urdu resource 

grammar to add support for Urdu in the 

work reported in (Angelov and Ranta, 

2010) which is an implementation of 

Attempto (Attempto 2008) in GF.  

 

1. Introduction 
 
Urdu is an Indo-European language of the Indo-

Aryan family, widely spoken in south Asia. It is 

a national language of Pakistan and one of the 

official languages of India. It is written in a 

modified Perso-Arabic script from right to left. 

As regards vocabulary, it has a strong influence 

of Arabic and Persian along with some 

borrowing from Turkish and English. Urdu is an 

SOV language having fairly free word order. It 

is closely related to Hindi as both originated 

from the dialect of Delhi region called khari boli 

(Masica, 1991). 

We develop a grammar for Urdu that addresses 

problems related to automated text translation 

using an Interlingua approach and provide a way 

to precisely translate text. This is described in 

Section 2. Then we describe different levels of 

grammar development including morphology 

(Section 3) and syntax (Section 4). In Section 6, 

we discuss an application in which a semantics-

driven translation system is built upon these 

components. 

 

2. GF (Grammatical Framework) 
 

GF (Grammatical Framework, Ranta 2004) is a 

tool for working with grammars, implementing a 

programming language for writing grammars 

which in term is based on a mathematical theory 

about languages and grammars
1
. Many 

multilingual dialog and text generation 

applications have been built using GF. GF 

grammars have two levels the abstract and the 

concrete syntax
2
. The abstract syntax is 

language independent and is common to all 

languages in GF grammar library. It is based on 

common syntactic or semantic constructions, 

which work for all the involved languages on an 

appropriate level of abstraction. The concrete 

syntax is language dependent and defines a 

mapping from abstract to actual textual 

representation in a specific language
2
. GF uses 

the term ‘category’ to model different parts of 

speech (e.g verbs, nouns adjectives etc.). An 

abstract syntax defines a set of categories, as 

well as a set of tree building functions. Concrete 

syntax contains rules telling how these trees are 

linearized. Separating the tree building rules 

(abstract syntax) from linearization rules 

(concrete syntax) makes it possible to have 

multiple concrete syntaxes for one abstract. This 

153



  

 

makes it possible to parse text in one language 

and translate it to multiple languages. 

Grammars in GF can be roughly classified into 

two kinds: resource grammars and application 

grammars. Resource grammars are general 

purpose grammars (Ranta, 2009a) that try to 

cover the general aspects of a language 

linguistically and whose abstract syntax encodes 

syntactic structures. Application grammars, on 

the other hand, encode semantic structures, but 

in order to be accurate they are typically limited 

to specific domains. However, they are not 

written from scratch for each domain, but they 

use resource grammars as libraries (Ranta 

2009b).  

Previously GF had resource grammars for 16 

languages: English, Italian, Spanish, French, 

Catalan, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finish, 

Russian, Bulgarian, German, Interlingua (an 

artificial language), Polish, Romanian and 

Dutch. Most of these languages are European 

languages. We developed resource grammar for 

Urdu making it the 17
th
 in total and the first 

south Asian language. Resource grammars for 

several other languages (e.g. Arabic, Turkish, 

Persian, Maltese and Swahili) are under 

construction. 

 

3. Morphology 
 
In GF resource grammars a test lexicon of 350 

words is provided for each language. These 

words are built through lexical functions. The 

rules for defining Urdu morphology are 

borrowed from (Humayoun et el., 2006), in 

which Urdu morphology was developed in the 

Functional Morphology toolkit (Forsberg and 

Ranta, 2004). Although it is possible to 

automatically generate equivalent GF code from 

it, we wrote the rules of morphology from 

scratch in GF, to receive better abstractions than 

are possible in generated code. Furthermore, we 

extend this work by including compound words. 

However, the details of morphology are beyond 

the scope of this paper, and its focus is on 

syntax. 

 

4. Syntax 
 

While morphological analysis deals with the 

formation and inflection of individual words, 

syntax shows how these words (parts of speech) 

are grouped together to build well formed 

phrases. In this section we show how this works 

and is implemented for Urdu. 

 

4.1 Noun Phrases (NP) 
 
When nouns are to be used in sentences as part 

of speech, then there are several linguistic 

details which need to be considered. For 

example other words can modify a noun, and 

nouns have characteristics such as gender, 

number etc. When all such required details are 

grouped together with the noun, the resulting 

structure is known as noun phrase (NP). The 

basic structure of Urdu noun phrase is, “(M) H 

(M)” according to (Butt M., 1995), where (M) is 

a modifier and (H) is the head of a NP. Head is 

the word which is compulsory and modifiers can 

or cannot be there. In Urdu modifiers are of two 

types pre-modifiers i.e modifiers that come 

before the head for instance (��� ���� kali: bli: 
“black cat”), and post-modifiers which come 

after the head for instance (�	 
�  tm sb “you 
all”). In GF resource library we represent NP as 

a record 

 

lincat NP : Type = {s : NPCase => Str ; a : 

Agr} ; 

 

where 

 

NPCase = NPC Case | NPErg | NPAbl                   

               |NPIns|NPLoc1NPLoc2 

               |NPDat;|NPAcc  

Case = Dir | Obl | Voc ; 

Agr = Ag Gender Number UPerson ; 

Gender = Masc | Fem ; 

UPerson = Pers1| Pers2_Casual 

                 | Pers2_Familiar | Pers2_Respect 

                 | Pers3_Near | Pers3_Distant; 

Number = Sg | Pl ; 

 

Thus NP is a record with two fields, ’s’ and ’a’. 

‘s’ is an inflection table and stores different 

forms of a noun.  

The Urdu NP has a system of syntactic cases 

which is partly different from the morphological 

cases of the category noun (N). The case 

markers that follow nouns in the form of post-

positions cannot be handled at lexical level 

154



  

 

through morphological suffixes and are thus 

handled at syntactic level (Butt et el., 2002). 

Here we create different forms of a noun phrase 

to handle case markers for Urdu nouns. Here is a 

short description of the different cases of NP : 

 

• NPC Case: this is used to retain the 
original case of Noun 

• NPErg: Ergative case with case marker 

‘ne: ے’ 
• NPAbl: Ablative with case marker ‘se: 

 ’	ے
• NPIns: Instrumental case with case 

marker ‘se: ے	’ 
• NPLoc1: Locative case with case 

marker ‘mi: ɳ ں��’ 
• NPLoc2: Locative case with case 

marker ‘pr ��’ 
• NPDat: Dative case with case marker 

‘kʋ ��’ 
• NPAcc: Accusative case with case 

marker ‘kʋ ��’ 
   

And ‘a’ (Agr in the code sample given in 

previous column) is the agreement feature of the 

the noun that is used for selecting the 

appropriate form of other categories that agree 

with nouns.   

A noun is converted to an intermediate category 

common noun (CN; also known as N-Bar) 

which is then converted to NP category. CN 

deals with nouns and their modifiers.  As an 

example consider adjectival modification:  

 

fun AdjCN   : AP -> CN  -> CN ;    

 

lin  AdjCN ap cn = { 

      s = \\n,c =>  

           ap.s ! n ! cn.g ! c ! Posit ++ cn.s ! n ! c ; 

      g = cn.g 

      } ; 

 

The linearization of AdjCN gives us common 

nouns such as (� ʈȹn ɖa pani: “cold ٹ��ڈا ��
water”) where a CN (��� pani: “water”) is 

modified by an AP (   .(”ʈȹn ɖa “cold ,  ٹ��ڈا
Since Urdu adjectives also inflect in number, 

gender, case and degree, we need to concatenate 

the appropriate form of adjective that agrees 

with common noun. This is ensured by selecting 

the corresponding forms of adjective and 

common noun from their inflection tables using 

selection operator (‘!’). Since CN does not 

inflect in degree but the adjective does, we fix 

the degree to be positive (Posit) in this 

construction. Other modifiers include possibly 

adverbs, relative clauses, and appositional 

attributes.  

A CN can be converted to a NP using different 

functions: common nouns with determiners; 

proper names; pronouns; and bare nouns as mass 

terms: 

 

 fun DetCN   : Det -> CN -> NP  (e.g the boy) 

fun UsePN   : PN -> NP (e.g John) 

fun UsePron : Pron -> NP  (e.g he) 

fun MassNP     : CN -> NP (e.g milk) 

 

These different ways of building NP’s, which 

are common in different languages, are defined 

in the abstract syntax of the resource grammar, 

but the linearization of these functions is 

language dependent and is therefore defined in 

the concrete syntaxes.   

   

4.2 Verb Phrases (VP) 
 
A verb phrase is a single or a group of words 

that act as a predicate. In our construction Urdu 

verb phrase has following structure 

 

lincat VP = { 

       s    : VPHForm => {fin, inf: Str} ; 

      obj  : {s : Str ; a : Agr} ;  

      vType : VType ; 

      comp : Agr => Str; 

      embComp : Str ; 

      ad  : Str  } ;  

 

where 

 

VPHForm =  

   VPTense VPPTense Agr  

    | VPReq HLevel | VPStem 

 

and 

 
  VPPTense = VPPres |VPPast |VPFutr; 

 HLevel = Tu |Tum |Ap |Neutr 

 

155



  

 

In GF representation a VP is a record with 

different fields. The most important field is ‘s’ 

which is an inflectional table and stores different 

forms of Verb.  

At VP level we define Urdu tenses by using a 

simplified tense system, which has only three 

tenses, named VPPres, VPPast, VPFutr. In case 

of VPTense for every possible combination of 

VPPTense and agreement (gender, number, 

person) a tuple of two string values {fin, inf : 

Str} is created. ‘fin’  stores the coupla (auxiliary 

verb) , and ‘inf’ stores corresponding form of 

verb. VPStem is a special tense which stores the 

root form of verb. This form is used to create the 

full set of Urdu tenses at clause level (tenses in 

which the root form of verb is used, i.e. 

perfective and progressive tenses). Handling 

tenses at clause level rather than at verb phrase 

level simplifies the VP and results in a more 

efficient grammar.  

The resource grammar has a common API 

which has a much simplified tense system, 

which is close to Germanic languages. It is 

divided into tense and anteriority. There are only 

four tenses named as present, past, future and 

conditional, and two possibilities of anteriority 

(Simul , Anter). This means it creates 8 

combinations. This abstract tense system does 

not cover all the tenses in Urdu. We have 

covered the rest of tenses at clause level, even 

though these tenses are not accessible by the 

common API, but still can be used in language 

specific modules. 

Other forms for verb phrases include request 

form (VPReq), imperative form (VPImp). There 

are four levels of requests in Urdu. Three of 

them correspond to (tʋ ��, tm 
� , a:p پ� ) honor 
levels and the fourth is neutral with respect to 

honorific levels.           . 

The Urdu VP is a complex structure that has 

different parts: the main part is a verb and then 

there are other auxiliaries attached to verb. For 

example an adverb can be attached to a verb as a 

modifier. We have a special field ‘ad’ in our VP 

representation. It is a simple string that can be 

attached with the verb to build a modified verb. 

In Urdu the complement of a verb precedes the 

actual verb e.g (ہے ����ہ � :ʋo dʋɽna tʃahti وہ دوڑ
he: “she want to run”), here (ہ���� tʃahna “want”) 
is complement of verb (� ,(”dʋɽna “run دوڑ
except in the case where, a sentence or a 

question is the complement of the verb. In that 

case complement of the verb comes at the very 

end of clause e.g (ʋo khta he: kh ʋo dʋɽti: he:   وہ
 .(”he says that she runs“ �ہ�� ہے �ہ وہ دوڑ�� ہے
We have two different fields named ‘compl’ and 

‘embCompl’ in the VP to deal with these 

different situations.  

 ‘vType’ field is used to store information about 

type of a verb. In Urdu a verb can be transitive, 

intransitive or double-transitive (Schmidt R. L., 

1999). This information is important when 

dealing with ergativity in verb agreement.  The 

information about the object of the verb is stored 

in ‘obj’ field. All this information that a VP 

carries is used when a VP is used in the 

construction of a clause. 

A distinguishing feature of Urdu verb agreement 

is ‘ergativity’. Urdu is one of those languages 

that shows split ergativity at verb level. Final 

verb agreement is with direct subjective except 

in the transitive perfective tense. In transitive 

perfective tense verb agreement is with direct 

object. In this case the subject takes the ergative 

construction (subject with addition of ergative 

case marker (ne: ے).  
However, in the case of the simple past tense, 

verb shows ergative behavior, but in case of 

other perfective tenses (e.g immediate past, 

remote past etc) there are two different 

approaches, in first one auxiliary verb (tʃka �$�) 
is used to make clauses. If (tʃka �$�) is used, 
verb does not show ergative behavior and final 

verb agreement is with direct subjective. 

Consider the following example 

 

  �ڑ�� ���ب '�&% �$� ہے
lɽka Direct ktab Direct xri:d Root tʃka aux_verb he: 
 The boy has bought a book 

 

The second way to make the same clause is 

 

  �ڑ�ے ے ���ب '�&%* ہے
lɽke: ne: Erg ktab Direct_Fem xri:di: Direct_Fem he:  
 The boy has bought a book 

 

In the first case the subject (lɽka, ڑ��� “boy”) is 
in direct case and auxiliary verb agrees to 

subject, but in second case verb is in agreement 

with object and ergative case of subject is used.  

However, in the current implementation we 

follow the first approach.  

156



  

 

In the concrete syntax we ensure this ergative 

behavior through the following code segment in 

GF. However the code given here is just a 

segment of the code that is relevant. 

 

case vt of { 

   VPPast => case vp.vType of { 

     (Vtrans| VTransPost) => <NPErg, vp.obj.a>  

      _                                => <NPC Dir, np.a> 

                    } ; 

   _ => <NPC Dir, np.a> 

            } ;                     

e.g in case of simple past tense if verb is 

transitive then ergative case of noun is used and 

agreement is with object of verb. In all other 

cases direct case of noun is used and agreement 

is with subject of verb. 

A VP is constructed in different ways; the 

simplest is  

 

fun UseV     : V   -> VP ; 

 

where V is the morphological category and VP 

is the syntactic category. There are other ways to 

make a VP from other categories, or 

combinations of categories. For example 

 

fun AdvVP    : VP -> Adv -> VP ; 

 

An adverb can be attached to a VP to make an 

adverbial modified VP. For example (i:haɳ  ہ�ں&
  ��	)   
 

4.3 Adjective Phrases (AP)  
 
Adjectives (A) are converted into the much 

richer category adjectival phrases (AP) at syntax 

level. The simplest function to convert is 

  

 fun PositA  : A  -> AP ; 

 

Its linearization is very simple, since in our case 

AP is similar to A e.g. 

 

fun PositA a = a ; 

 

There are other ways of making AP for example 

 

fun ComparA : A  -> NP -> AP ; 

 

When a comparative AP is created from an 

adjective and a NP, constant “se: ے	” is used 
between oblique form of noun and adjective. For 

example linearization of above function is 

 

lin ComparA a np = { 

    s = \\n,g,c,d => np.s ! NPC Obl ++ "se:"          

         ++ a.s ! n ! g ! c ! d ;                        

       } ;   

 

4.4 Clauses 
 
A clause is a syntactic category that has variable 

tense, polarity and order. Predication of a NP 

and VP gives simplest clause 

 

fun PredVP    : NP -> VP -> Cl ; 

 

The subject-verb agreement is insured through 

agreement feature of NP which is passed to verb 

as inherent feature. A clause is of following type 

 

lincat Clause : Type = {s : VPHTense => 

Polarity => Order => Str} ; 

 

Here VPHTense represents different tenses in 

Urdu. Even though current abstract level of 

common API does not cover all tenses of Urdu, 

we cover them at clause level and can be 

accessed through language specific module. So, 

VPHTense is of following type 

 

 VPHTense =  VPGenPres | VPPastSimple  

                      | VPFut | VPContPres 

                      | VPContPast | VPContFut 

                      | VPPerfPres  | VPPerfPast           

                      | VPPerfFut    | VPPerfPresCont 

                      | VPPerfPastCont 

                      | VPPerfFutCont | VPSubj 

 

Polarity is used to make positive and negative 

sentences; Order is used to make simple and 

interrogative sentences. These parameters are of 

following forms 

 

Polarity  = Pos | Neg  

Order    = ODir | OQuest    

 

PredVP function will create clauses with 

variable tense, polarity and order which are 

157



  

 

fixed at sentence level by different functions, 

one is.  

 

fun UseCl    : Temp -> Pol -> Cl  -> S 

 

Here Temp is syntactic category which is in the 

form of a record having field for Tense and 

Anteriority. Tense in the Temp category refers 

to abstract level Tense and we just map it to 

Urdu tenses by selecting the appropriate clause.  

This will create simple declarative sentence, 

other forms of sentences (e.g Question 

sentences) are handled in Questions categories 

of GF which follows next. 

 

4.5 Question Clauses and  Question 
Sentences 

 

Common API provides different ways to create 

question clauses. The simplest way is to create 

from simple clause 

 

fun QuestCl     : Cl -> QCl ; 

 

In Urdu simple interrogative sentences are 

created by just adding “ki:a ���” at the start of a 
direct clause that already have been created at 

clause level. Hence, the linearization of above 

function simply selects appropriate form of 

clause and adds “ki:a ���” at the start. However 
this clause still has variable tense and polarity 

which is fixed at sentence level e.g 

 

fun UseQCl   : Temp -> Pol -> QCl -> QS 

 

Other forms of question clauses include clauses 

made with interrogative pronouns (IP), 

interrogative adverbs (IAdv), and interrogative 

determiners (IDet), categories. Some of the 

functions for creating question clauses are 

 

fun QuestVP     : IP -> VP -> QCl  (e.g who 

walks) 

fun QuestIAdv   : IAdv -> Cl -> QCl (e.g why 

does he walk) 

 

IP, IAdv, IDet etc are built at morphological 

level and can also be created with following 

functions. 

 

fun AdvIP     : IP -> Adv -> IP  

fun IdetQuant : IQuant -> Num -> IDet ; 

fun PrepIP    : Prep -> IP -> IAdv ; 

 

5. Example 
 
As an example consider the translation of 

following sentence from English to Urdu, to see 

how our proposed system works at different 

levels.  

 

He drinks hot milk. 

Figure 1 shows the parse tree for this sentence. 

As a resource grammar developer our goal is to 

provide correct concrete level linearization of 

this tree for Urdu.  

 
          

Figure 1. Parse tree of an example sentence 

 

The nodes in this tree represent different 

categories and its branching shows how a 

particular category is built from other categories 

and/or leaves (words from lexicon). In GF 

notation these are the syntactic rules which are 

declared at abstract level. For example category 

CN can be built from an AP (adjectival phrase) 

and a CN. So in GF representation it has 

following type signature. 

 

fun AdjCN   : AP -> CN  -> CN ; 

 

A correct implementation of this rule in Urdu 

concrete syntax ensures correct formation of a 

common noun (م دوده�. grm dʋdȺ “hot milk”) 
from a CN (دوده dʋdȺ “milk”) modified by an 
Adjective ( .(”grm  “hot ,  .�م

158



______________________________ 

3  http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis.html 

 

A NP is constructed from this CN by one of the 

NP construction rules (see section 4.1 for 

details). A VPSlash (object missing VP) is build 

from a two place verb (���� pi:ta “drinks”). This 
VPSlash is then converted to VP through 

function 

 

fun ComplSlash : VPSlash -> NP -> VP ; 

 

Resulting VP and NP are grouped together to 

make a VP (ہے �� :ʈgrm dʋdȺ pi:ta he .�م دوده ��
“drinks hot milk”). Finally clause (ہے �� .�م دوده ��

 ʋh grm dʋdȺ pi:ta he: “he drinks hot milk”) is وہ
build from NP (وہ ʋh “he”) which is build from 
pronoun (وہ ʋh “he”)   and VP (ہے �� .�م دوده ��
grm dʋdȺ pi:ta he: “drinks hot milk”). Language 
dependent concrete syntax assures that correct 

forms of words are selected from lexicon and 

word order is according to rules of that specific 

language. While, morphology makes sure that 

correct forms of words are built during lexicon 

development. 

 

6. An application: Attempto 
 
An experiment of implementing Controlled 

languages in GF is reported in (Angelov and 

Ranta, 2010). In this experiment, a grammar for 

Attempto Controlled English (Attempto, 2008) 

is implemented and then ported to six languages 

(English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, and 

Swedish) using the GF resource library. To 

demonstrate the usefulness of our grammar and 

to check its correctness, we have added Urdu to 

this set. Now, we can translate Attempto 

documents between all of these seven languages. 

The implementation followed the general recipe 

for how new languages can be added (Angelov 

and Ranta, 2009) and created no surprises. 

However the details of this implementation are 

beyond the scope of this paper. 

 

7. Related Work 
 
A suite of Urdu resources were reported in 

(Humayoun et el., 2006) including a fairly 

complete open-source Urdu morphology and a 

small fragment of syntax in GF. In this sense, it 

is a predecessor of Urdu resource grammar, 

implemented in a different but related 

formalism. 

Like the GF resource library, Pargram project 

(Butt et el., 2007) aims at building a set of 

parallel grammars including Urdu. The 

grammars in Pargram are connected with each 

other by transfer functions, rather than a 

common representation. Further, the Urdu 

grammar is still one of the least implemented 

grammars in Pargram at the moment. This 

project is based on the theoretical framework of 

lexical functional grammar (LFG).  

Other than Pargram, most work is based on LFG 

and translation is unidirectional i.e. from 

English to Urdu only. For instance, English to 

Urdu MT System is developed under the Urdu 

Localization Project (Hussain, 2004), (Sarfraz 

and Naseem, 2007) and (Khalid et el., 2009).  

Similarly, (Zafer and Masood, 2009) reports 

another English-Urdu MT system developed 

with example based approach. On the other 

hand, (Sinha and Mahesh, 2009) presents a 

strategy for deriving Urdu sentences from 

English-Hindi MT system. However, it seems to 

be a partial solution to the problem.  

 

8. Future Work 
 

The common resource grammar API does not 

cover all the aspects of Urdu language, and non-

generalizable language-specific features are 

supposed to be handled in language-specific 

modules. In our current implementation of Urdu 

resource grammar we have not covered those 

features. For example in Urdu it is possible to 

build a VP from only VPSlash (VPSlash 

category represents object missing VP) e.g (ہے 

����� kȹata he:) without adding the object. This 
rule is not present in the common API. One 

direction for future work is to cover such 

language specific features. 

Another direction for future work could be to 

include the causative forms of verb which are 

not included in the current implementation due 

to efficiency issues. 

 

9. Conclusion 
 
The resource grammar we develop consists of 

44 categories and 190 functions
3
 which cover a 

fair enough part of language and is enough for

159



 

building domain specific application grammars 

including multilingual dialogue systems, 

controlled language translation, software 

localization etc. Since a common API for 

multiple languages is provided, this grammar is 

useful in applications where we need to parse 

and translate the text from one to many other 

languages.  

However our approach of common abstract 

syntax has its limitations and does not cover all 

aspects of Urdu language. This is why it is not 

possible to use our grammar for arbitrary text 

parsing and generation.
