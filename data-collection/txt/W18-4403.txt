Abstract

This paper describes the participation of the IRIT team to the TRAC 2018 shared task on Aggres-
sion Identification and more precisely to the shared task in English language. The three following
methods have been used: a) a combination of machine learning techniques that relies on a set
of features and document/text vectorization, b) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and c) a
combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
Best results were obtained when using the method (a) on the English test data from Facebook
which ranked our method sixteenth out of thirty teams, and the method (c) on the English test
data from other social media, where we obtained the fifteenth rank out of thirty.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the emergence of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. changes the way
people communicate (Sticca and Perren, 2013).

Although these platforms give many benefits to their users, they can also have several negative impacts
where people can be hurt for example by some aggressive texts (Dadvar et al., 2012). The aggression
on social media platforms is actually more harmful than traditional bullying for many reasons such as
allowing people to hide behind an alias (Sticca and Perren, 2013). Unfortunately, such phenomena of
on-line aggression and bullying not only have created psychological and mental health issues for on-line
users, but it can end by forcing some of them to change several things in their lives and can even conduct
them to suicide according to (Kumar et al., 2018b). The TRAC 2018 workshop has been created in order
to study these problems (Kumar et al., 2018a).

The TRAC 2018 workshop aims at providing the framework for evaluatig systems that aim at detect-
ing/identifying aggression, trolling, cyberbullying and other related phenomena in both speech and text
from social media (Kumar et al., 2018a). The shared task challenge consists in distinguishing three levels
of aggression from text: overtly aggressive, covertly aggressive and non-aggressive. Overtly aggressive
means that there is an expression of aggression directly with specific words or keywords. Covertly
aggressive expresses aggression subtly such as indirect attack or with more polite expressions. Two
different languages are studied independently: English and Hindi.

The shared task was organized into two different stages: training and testing. During the training
stage, two datasets of 15, 000 aggression-annotated Facebook posts and comments, one in English and
the other in Hindi, were provided. During testing stage, the organizers also included a data set from a
second social media platform. Overall, the test data set contains four sub-collections: two from Facebook
and two from another social media (not named by the organizers); for each source, one sub-collection is
in English while the other is in Hindi.Participants could participate to one or several of the four subtasks
which are: (1) English (Facebook) task, (2) Hindi (Facebook) task, (3) English (another social media)
task, and (4) Hindi (another social media).

More details about the task can be found in (Kumar et al., 2018a). Our team, IRIT, participated to
shared task in English language for both Facebook and the other social media platform: subtask (1) and
(3).

In this paper, we report the methods we proposed when participating to the subtasks; we have de-
veloped three approaches that we compare in this paper on the problem of aggression identification in
texts.

The first method is a combination of two classifiers : random forest that relies on features ranging from
surface features to more linguistic features and logistic regression based on text vectorization. We named
this method Trac-RF LR. The second approach is a deep learning technique widely used in image area
and adapted for text classification. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network and we named it Trac-CNN
in the rest of the paper. Finally, the third approach is a combination of two deep learning techniques:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We named this method
Trac-CNN LSTM.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is an overview of state-of-the-art ap-
proaches for aggression detection. Section 3 details the methods we developed. Section 4 reports the
results as well as the data sets and Section 5 concludes this paper.

2 Related Work

Several series of evaluation forums for applications related to social media have been developed in the
recent years, such as tweet contextualisation (Ermakova et al., 2017) or e-risk (Losada et al., 2017) in
CLEF. TRAC is the first that focus on detecting aggressive text. In the last few years, several studies have
been published in which the problem of detecting abusive language in social media has been tackled.
Although researchers focused on different aspects of abusive language such as cyberbullying (Dadvar et
al., 2013), hate speech (Warner and Hirschberg, 2012), profanity (Sood et al., 2012) and abusive language
in general (Chen et al., 2012), most of the approaches are based on supervised approaches (Schmidt and
Wiegand, 2017). Generally, the detection of abusive language is considered as a classification problem,
mainly as a binary text classification problem (Bosque and Garza, 2014) detecting whether the text
contains abusive parts or not.

For text classification problems, approaches based on features are widely used.

Methods are based on simple surface features such as unigrams and/or n-grams (Xu et al., 2012; Chen
et al., 2012; Waseem and Hovy, 2016; Abdou Malam et al., 2017), key-phrases (Mothe et al., 2018),
the frequency of punctuation, capitalized words, Htag, image, URL mentions (Hoang and Mothe, 2017),
average length of words, or frequency of words that do not exist in English dictionaries (Chen et al.,
2012; Nobata et al., 2016). Other features are: word generalization (for example using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) (Zhong et al., 2016) and word/paragraph embedding (Nobata et al., 2016)), sentiment
analysis (Xu et al., 2012; Dinakar et al., 2012; Hee et al., 2015); lexical resources (Burnap and Williams,
2015; Burnap and Williams, 2016; Gitari et al., 2015; Hoang and Mothe, 2018); linguistic features (Xu
et al., 2012; Gitari et al., 2015; Burnap and Williams, 2016; Nobata et al., 2016; Abdou Malam et al.,
2017); knowledge-based features (Dinakar et al., 2012); and meta-information (Dadvar et al., 2012;
Dadvar et al., 2013; Waseem and Hovy, 2016).

Using these features, supervised classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used in order
to classify a text as containing aggressiveness or not (Schmidt and Wiegand, 2017).

In recent years, deep learning has been also employed. For example, (Mehdad and Tetreault, 2016)
used Recurrent Neural Network Language Model which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks for the
task of abusive language detection. The choice of this type of models is based on the fact that with few
training data, they can achieve good results for language models.

In addition of detecting if a text contains something harmful and/or aggressive, another challenge is to
distinguish the different aspects of the abusive language. (Malmasi and Zampieri, 2018) try to distinguish
general profanity from hate speech, but their results show that it is difficult to differentiate one from the
other. Their study also shows that all hate speech, bullying text, cyberbullying and abusive language are
not explicit, there are aggressive text written with subtle language and it can be hard to distinguish them.
This observation motivated the shared task not only to classify the text as aggressive or not, but also to
distinguish two kinds of aggression: overt and covert aggression.

3 Developped methods for the IRIT participation

In this section, we present the three supervised approaches we developed to automatically detect aggres-
sion in texts and that we submitted to TRAC 2018 shared task for English.

3.1 Trac-RF LR: combination of two classifiers

In this model we combine two classifiers namely random forest and logistic regression where the first
one is based on different set of features from surface features to more linguistic features and the second
one is based on document vectorization. In the following, we first describe each classifier, then we detail
the combination method used.

Classifiers description

i) Features - RF Classifier:

This model uses different features, adapted from features used for depression detection in (Ab-
dou Malam et al., 2017), and are computed from the texts to predict the aggression. We represent texts
with a vector composed of the features as presented in Table 1.

Name Hypothesis or tool/resource used
Part-Of-Speech frequency Normalized frequencies of each tag: adjectives, verbs, nouns and

adverbs (four features). The idea behind is to check offensive
words used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs.

Negation Normalized frequencies of negative words like: no, not, didn’t,
can’t, ... The idea behind is to detect non direct aggressiveness.

Capitalized The idea behind is that aggressive texts tend to put emphasis on
the target they mention. It can indicate feelings or speaking vol-
ume.

Punctuation marks ! or ? or any combination of both can emphasize offensiveness of
texts.

Emoticons Another way to express sentiment or feeling.

Sentiment Use of NRC-Sentiment-Emotion-Lexicons1 to trace the polarity
in text.

Emotions Frequency of emotions from specific categories: anger, fear, sur-
prise, sadness and disgust. The idea behind is to check the cate-
gories related to aggressiveness.

Gunning Fog Index Estimate of the years of education that a person needs to under-
stand the text at first reading.

Flesch Reading Ease Measure how difficult to understand a text is.

Linsear Write Formula Developed for the U.S. Air Force to calculate the readability of
their technical manuals2.

New Dale-Chall Read-
ability

Measure the difficulty of comprehension that persons encounter
when reading a text. It is inspired from Flesch Reading Ease
measure.

Swear words The intuition behind is that the texts containing insults are often
aggressive.

Lexical analysis with
python library empath

Empath is a tool for analyzing text across lexical categories. By
default, it has 194 lexical categories and each category is consid-
ered as feature.

Table 1: List of features used in RF.



22

Some of these features are used for abusive language detection, hate speech, cyberbullying and the
others are used for sentiment or personality analysis that we judged useful for aggression detection.

A random forest classifier was trained on train and validation sets by representing each text with a vec-
tor composed by the features we mentioned above. The following parameters were used during the train-
ing: class weight=”balanced”, max features=”sqrt”, n estimators=60, min weight fraction leaf=0.0,
criterion=’entropy’, random state=2.

At prediction time, a text from the test set is represented with features and then run the trained model.
The output is the estimated probabilities for the three classes (overtly aggressive, covertly aggressive and
non-aggressive).

ii) Document vector - LR Classifier:

This model is based on document vectorization using Doc2vec (Le and Mikolov, 2014). Doc2vec is
used to represent sentences, paragraphs, or whole documents as vectors and it can be trained on small
corpora, which is case of the task datasets.

Before building the model (LR Classifier), we first trained two separate Doc2vec models: a Distributed
Bag of Words and a Distributed Memory model (Le and Mikolov, 2014). For the training, we used the
same configuration as in (Trotzek et al., 2017) for representing user’s text in order to detect if he or she is
depressed. The two Doc2vec models are trained on English text from the train and validation sets and we
used the Python package gensim3(Rehurek and Sojka, 2010). We also concatenated the output vectors
of these two models, as done in (Trotzek et al., 2017), resulting in a representation by a 200-dimension
vector per text.

Then a logistic regression classifier was trained on the vectors for both the train and validation sets with
the following parameters : class weight=”balanced”, random state=1, max iter=100, solver=”liblinear”.

At prediction time, the texts from the test set were vectorized by using the two Doc2vec models and
the 200-dimension vectors were given as input of trained classifier. The output is also a set of class
probabilities.

Combination of two classifiers
After the two classifiers (as described in section 3.1) provided their results, the calculated class probabil-
ities obtained from RF classifier and LR Classifier were averaged and finally the class with the highest
probability was considered as the class the text belongs to.

3.2 Trac-CNN: Model based on CNN

This model is based on the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN)(LeCun et al., 1998). CNN which is widely used in image analysis (Bhandare et al., 2016) and
has been adapted for text classification such as sentiment analysis (Chen et al., 2017). Figure 1 shows
the model architecture that we used for TRAC 2018 shared task.

We can see in this figure that before sending the text to the CNN, it is transformed as a matrix where
each row is a vector representation4 of words that compose the text5 . To perform convolutions on the
sentence matrix, we decided to use three sizes of filters6: bigrams (height = 2), trigrams (height = 3) and
fourgrams (height = 4) filters, each of which has 100 filters (in total we had 300 filters). The result of
convolutions is called feature map, a vector with variable-length according to the filter size and we had
300 features map. The 1-max pooling (Boureau et al., 2010), a common strategy, is performed over each

4We used word2vec trained on the training and validation sets. Two models were trained, namely CBOW and Skip-gram

(Mikolov et al., 2013), and the final vector is a 200-dimensional vector which is a concatenation of the results from these
models.

5All the texts need to be the same length in order to have the same matrix size. We used Keras zero-pads at the beginning if
a text length is shorter than the maximum length (= length of longer text/document in the datasets).

6The width of filters are the same as word vectors (i.e 200) but the heights are different.

feature map. More precisely, the largest number from each feature map is kept and then concatenated to
form a concatenated vector, where the dimension is equal to 300. Then we added one fully connected
hidden layer to reduce the dimension of the concatenated vector , the dropout is performed on the hidden
layer because dropout helps to reduce over fitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). Finally, the latest feature
vector is fed through a sigmoid function to generate the final classification.

3.3 Trac-CNN LSTM: Combination of CNN and LSTM

This model combines two deep learning techniques: CNN and LSTM. The main idea is to modify the
CNN architecture presented in Figure 1 by adding a LSTM layer and change the activation function
to softmax for the last classification. The LSTM is inserted after the poling layer and before the fully
connected hidden layer. It takes as input the 300-dimension concatenated feature vector and gives as
output a 300-dimension vector. Figure 2 presents the architecture of the combination.

4 Results

In this section, we detail the data used for TRAC 2018 shared task and the result we obtained using our
different models.

4.1 Data

The way the dataset used in the TRAC 2018 shared task was built is described in (Kumar et al., 2018b).
The dataset in the shared task was divided in three sets: training, validation and test. The training and

validation sets were released during the training stage to allow participants to train and built their systems.
These two sets are composed of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook posts and comments written
in English for participants who want to participate in this language and 15,001 aggression-annotated
Facebook writen in Hindi for those who prefer to work in this language.

For the test set, the collection crawled from Facebook is also divided into two languages, 916 posts
and comments for the English dataset and 970 for the Hindi dataset. The organizers also included what
they called the surprise collection crawled from another social media, also divided into two languages
(1,257 posts and comments for English and 1,194 for Hindi). Table 2 describes the datasets used in the
shared task, it reports the total number of posts and comments (texts) in each set and the number of
texts with overt and covert aggression and texts without aggression. We can see from the Table 2 that
the proportion of aggressive text is more important in the Hindi dataset (13,803 texts which correspond
to 80.4% of total aggressive text (17,173)) than in the English dataset (9,776 texts which correspond to
56.9% of total aggressive text (17,165)).

4.2 Models
All submitted models was evaluated using weighted macro-averaged F-scores. This measure is defined
by organizers as follow: for each class, the individual F-score was weighted by the proportion of the
concerned class in the test set and then the average of these individual weighted F-scores is the final
F-score (See (Kumar et al., 2018a)). In order to have a baseline for comparison, the organizers give a
random baseline generated by assigning random labels.

Table 3 reports the results we obtained with the three models (see Section 3) we submitted for the
shared task and the baseline given by organizers. We can see that all of our models outperform the
baseline on both Facebook and the other social media platform. More precisely Trac-RF gives the best
results on Facebook and Trac-CNN LSTM on the other social media.

We can also see that our three models give better results on Facebook, this could be due to the train
dataset which is only composed of texts crawled from Facebook.

5 Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we presented our participation to TRAC 2018 shared task on aggression identification in
English language for both platforms: Facebook and the other social media. We proposed three kinds
different methods: (a) a combination of machine learning techniques (classifiers) that relies on a set of
features and document vectorization, (b) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); and (c) combination of
CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We obtained encouraging results: sixteenth out of thirty
teams with method (a) for Facebook and fifteenth out of thirty for the other social media with method
(c).

We can conclude that the model based on features gives the best results if the train dataset is built from
the same platform as the test dataset. However a deeper analysis of features is to be done to get stronger
conclusions. We can also see that deep learning models perform well even if the train and test datasets
are built from different platforms (unlike combined RF and LR models). So these techniques are useful
to build systems that can identify aggression on different social media.

For future work, we will analyze what the best features are for aggression detection by analyzing
those we already used and/or adding new ones. For example, more linguistic-oriented features such as



26

specific writing or structure of sentences/paragraphs containing aggression could be added and feature
like ”proportion of aggressive text posted last year”. Finally, we would like to improve our model based
on deep learning by using different configurations and architectures, by combining it with traditional
machine learning algorithms (RF and LR models), and also training a model on large datasets built from
different social media platforms.
