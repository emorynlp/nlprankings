Abstract

LIUM participated in the System Combi-
nation task of the Fifth Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation (WMT 2010).
Hypotheses from 5 French/English MT
systems were combined with MANY, an
open source system combination software
based on confusion networks currently de-
veloped at LIUM.

The system combination yielded signifi-
cant improvements in BLEU score when
applied on WMT’09 data. The same be-
havior has been observed when tuning is
performed on development data of this
year evaluation.

1 Introduction

This year, the LIUM computer science labora-
tory has participated in the French-English sys-
tem combination task at WMT’10 evaluation cam-
paign. The system used for this task is MANY1

(Barrault, 2010), an open source system combina-
tion software based on Confusion Networks (CN).
Several improvements have been made in order to
being able to combine many systems outputs in a
decent time.

The focus has been put on the tuning step, and
more precisely how to perform system parameter
tuning. Two methods have been experimented cor-
responding to two different representations of sys-
tem combination. In the first one, system combi-
nation is considered as a whole : fed by system
hypotheses as input and generating a new hypoth-
esis as output. The second method considers that
the alignment module is independent from the de-
coder, so that the parameters from each module
can be tuned separately.

1MANY is available at the following address http://
www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/˜barrault/MANY

Those tuning approaches are described in sec-
tion 3. Before that, a quick description of MANY,
including recent developments, can be found in
section 2. Results on WMT’09 data are pre-
sented in section 4 along results of tuning on
newssyscombtune2010.

2 System description

MANY is a system combination software (Bar-
rault, 2010) based on the decoding of a lattice
made of several Confusion Networks (CN). This is
a widespread approach in MT system combination
(Rosti et al., 2007); (Shen et al., 2008); (Karakos
et al., 2008). MANY can be decomposed in two
main modules. The first one is the alignment mod-
ule which actually is a modified version of TERp
(Snover et al., 2009). Its role is to incrementally
align the hypotheses against a backbone in order to
create a confusion network. Those confusion net-
works are then connected together to create a lat-
tice. This module uses different costs (which cor-
responds to a match, an insertion, a deletion, a sub-
stitution, a shift, a synonym and a stem) to com-
pute the best alignment and incrementally build
a confusion network. In the case of confusion
network, the match (substitution, synonyms, and
stems) costs are considered when the word in the
hypothesis matches (is a substitution, a synonyms
or a stems of) at least one word of the considered
confusion sets in the CN, as shown in Figure 1.

The second module is the decoder. This decoder
is based on the token pass algorithm and it accepts
as input the lattice previously created. The proba-
bilities computed in the decoder can be expressed
as follow :

log(PW ) =
Len(W )∑

n=0

{
α1logPws(n) + α2logPlm(n)

+α3Lpen(n) + α4Npen(n)
}

(1)

where Len(W ) is the length of the hypothesis,

Pws(n) is the score of the nth word in the lattice,
Plm(n) is its LM probability, Lpen(n) is the length
penalty (which apply when Wn is not a null-arc),
Npen(n) is the penalty applied when crossing a
null-arc, and the αi are the features weights.

Multithreading

One major issue with system combination con-
cerns scaling. Indeed, in order to not lose infor-
mation about word order, all system hypotheses
are considered as backbone and all other hypothe-
ses are aligned to it to create a CN. Consequently,
if we consider N system outputs, then to build N
confusion networks, N ∗ (N − 1) alignments with
modified TERp have to be performed. Moreover,
in order to get better results, the TERp costs have
to be optimized, which requires a lot of iterations,
all of which calculate N ∗ (N − 1) alignments.
However, the building of a CN with system i as
backbone does not depend on the building of CN
with other system as backbone. Therefore multi-
threading has been integrated into MANY so that
multiple CNs can be created in parallel. From now
on, the number of thread can be specified in the
configuration file.

3 Tuning

As mentioned before, MANY is made of two main
modules : the alignment module based on a modi-
fied version of TERp and the decoder. Considering
10 systems, 19 parameters in total have to be op-
timized in order to get better results. By default,
TERp costs are set to 0.0 for match and 1.0 for
everything else. These costs are not correct, since
a shift in that case will hardly be possible. TERp

costs, system priors, fudge factor, null-arc penalty,
length penalty are tuned with Condor (a global op-
timizer based on the Powell’s algorithm, (Berghen
and Bersini, 2005)).

Two ways of tuning have been experimented.
The first one consists in optimizing the whole set
of parameters together (see section 3.1). The sec-
ond one rely on the (maybe likely) independence
of the TERp parameters towards those of the de-
coder and consists in tuning TERp parameters in
a first step and then using the optimized TERp
costs when tuning the decoder parameters (see
section 3.2).

3.1 Tuning all parameters together
Condor is an optimizer which aims at minimizing
a certain objective function. In our case, the ob-
jective function is the whole system combination.
As input, it takes the whole set of parameters (i.e.
TERp costs except match costs (which is always
set to 0), system priors, the fudge factor, and null-
arc and length penalty) and outputs -BLEU score.
The BLEU score is one of the most robust met-
rics as presented in (Leusch et al., 2009), which is
consequently an obvious target for optimization.

Such a tuning protocol has the disadvantage
to be slower as all the confusion networks have
to be regenerated at each step because the TERp
costs provided by the optimizer will hardly be the
same for two iterations (thus, confusion networks
computed during previous iterations can hardly be
reused). Another issue with this approach is that it
is hard to converge when the parameter set is that
large. This is mainly due to the fact that we can-
not guarantee the convexity of the problem. How-
ever, one advantage is that the possible correlation
between all parameters are taken into account dur-
ing the optimization process, which is not the case
when optimizing in several steps.

3.2 Two-step tuning
Tuning TERp parameters : In order to opti-
mize TERp parameters (i.e. del, ins, sub, shift,
stem and syn costs), we have to determine which
measure to use to evaluate a certain configuration.
We naturally considered the minimization of the
TERp score. To do so, the confusion networks are
built using the set of parameters given by the op-
timizer. TERp scores are then calculated between
the reference and each CN, and summed up.

The goal of this step is to guide the confusion
networks generation process to produce sentences

272



similar to the reference. Consequently, if the con-
fusion networks generated at this step have a lower
TERp score, then this means that the decoder is
more likely to find a better hypothesis inside.

Tuning decoder parameters : Based on the
TERp configuration determined at the previous
step, this step aims at finding good parameter val-
ues. Those parameters control the final hypothe-
sis size and the importance given to the language
model probabilities compared to the translation
scores (occurring on words). The metric which is
minimized is -BLEU for the same reasons men-
tioned in section 3.1.

4 Experiments and Results

During experiments, data from last year evaluation
campaign are used for testing the tuning approach.
news-dev2009a is used as development set, and
news-dev2009b as internal test, these corpora are
described in Table 1.

words and tokens calculated on the reference.

For the sake of speed and simplicity, the five
best systems (ranking given by score on dev) are
considered only. Baseline systems performances
on dev and test are presented in Table 2.

When tuning all parameters together, the set ob-
tained is presented in Table 3. The 2-step tuning

protocol applied on news-dev2009a provides the

can observe that 2-step tuning provides almost 0.9
BLEU point improvement on development corpus
which is well reflected on test set with a gain of
more than 0.7 BLEU. The best results are obtain
when tuning all parameters together, which give
more than 1 BLEU point improvement on dev and
more than 0.9 on test.

4.1 Discussion

Choosing a measure to optimize the TERp costs is
not something easy. One important remark is that
default (equal) costs are not suitable to get good
confusion networks. The goal of the confusion
networks is to make possible the generation of a
new hypothesis which can be different from those
provided by each individual system.

In these experiments, TERp calculated between
the CNs and the reference is used as the distance
to be minimized by the optimizer. We can no-
tice that for the 2-step optimization, the deletion
cost is very small. This is probably not a value
which is expected, because in this case, this means
that deletions can occur in an hypothesis without
penalizing it a lot. However, this parameter set
has a beneficial impact on the system combination
performance. Another comment is that the sys-
tem weights are not directly proportional to the re-
sults. This suggests that some phrases proposed
by weaker systems can have a higher importance
for system combination.

By contrast, optimizing parameters all together
provides more fair weights, according to the re-

273



sults of the single systems.

4.2 2010 evaluation campaign

For this year system combination tasks, a de-
velopment corpus (syscombtune) and the test
(syscombtest), described in Table 6, were pro-
vided to participants.

Language model : The English target language
models has been trained on all monolingual data
provided for the translation tasks. In addition,
LDC’s Gigaword collection was used for both lan-
guages. Data corresponding to the development
and test periods were removed from the Gigaword
collections.

Tuning on syscombdev2010 corpus produced
the parameter set presented in Table 7

The result provided by the system with this con-
figuration can be compared to the single systems

A behavior comparable to WMT’09 evaluation
campaign is observed, which suggests that the ap-
proach is correct.

5 Conclusion and future work

We have shown that tuning all parameters together
is better than 2-step tuning. However, the second
method has not been fully explored. Tuning TERp
parameters targeting minimum TERp score is not
satisfying. Therefore, an alternative measure, like
ngram agreement which would be more related to
BLEU, can be considered in order to obtain better
parameters.

Further improvement for MANY will be con-
sidered like case insensitive combination then re-
casing the output using majority vote on the con-
fusion networks. This is currently a work in
progress.
