Abstract

This paper evaluates four metaphor identi-
fication systems on the 200,000 word VU
Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, comparing re-
sults by genre and by sub-class of metaphor.
The paper then compares the rate of agree-
ment between the systems for each genre and
sub-class. Each of the identification systems
is based, explicitly or implicitly, on a the-
ory of metaphor which hypothesizes that cer-
tain properties are essential to metaphor-in-
language. The goal of this paper is to see what
the success or failure of these systems can tell
us about the essential properties of metaphor-
in-language. The success of the identification
systems varies significantly across genres and
sub-classes of metaphor. At the same time, the
different systems achieve similar success rates
on each even though they show low agree-
ment among themselves. This is taken to
be evidence that there are several sub-types
of metaphor-in-language and that the ideal
metaphor identification system will first de-
fine these sub-types and then model the lin-
guistic properties which can distinguish these
sub-types from one another and from non-
metaphors.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate four sys-
tems for identifying metaphor-in-language on the
large and representative VU Amsterdam Metaphor
Corpus (Steen, et al., 2010) and then to analyze the
correct and incorrect identifications in order to see
what they can tell us about the linguistic properties

of metaphor-in-language. The four metaphor identi-
fication systems include a word-level semantic simi-
larity measurement method (Sporleder and Li, 2009;
Li and Sporleder, 2010), a word-level abstract-
ness measurement method (Turney and Littmann,
2003; Turney, et al., 2011), a grammatical-relation-
level source-target mapping method (Shutova, 2010;
Shutova and Teufel, 2010; Shutova, Sun, and Ko-
rhonen, 2010; Shutova, Teufel, and Korhonen,
2013), and an utterance-level domain interaction
method (Dunn, 2013b).

2 The VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus

The VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (Steen, et
al., 2010) consists of approximately 200,000 words
taken from the British National Corpus’s Baby Cor-
pus and divided into four genres: academic, news,
fiction, and conversation. It was manually annotated
for metaphoric uses of words by five analysts us-
ing a version of the MIP method (Pragglejaz Group,
2007). For the purposes of this study, the corpus
was divided into sentences, under the assumption
that each sentence represents an utterance. There
are 16,202 sentences in the corpus. Sentences which
contain at least one metaphoric use of a word are la-
beled as metaphoric sentences. This is done because
a metaphorically used word is not metaphoric except
in relation to its linguistic context; thus, a larger lin-
guistic unit like the sentence is necessary for reveal-
ing metaphorically used words.

The VU Amsterdam Corpus is annotated with
several sub-classes of metaphor-in-language. The
sub-classes included in this evaluation are MRW-
Met (a metaphoric use of a metaphor related word);

MRW-Lit (a literal use of a metaphor related
word); PP (a possible personification resulting in a
metaphor related word); Double (a metaphor related
word which is involved in a double metaphor; for ex-
ample, personification and a conceptual metaphor);
WIDLII (possible metaphor related words which
were considered ambiguous between metaphoric
and non-metaphoric use).

Table 1 shows a break-down of the number of sen-
tences in each of these sub-classes in the corpus as a
whole and as represented by each of the metaphor
identification systems. Because each system uses
different linguistic properties to identify metaphor-
in-language and uses different methods to represent
those properties, the systems differ in how many
of the sentences are sufficiently represented. For
example, the semantic similarity measurement sys-
tem looks at pairwise similarity values while the ab-
stractness measurement system looks at values for
individual words. Thus, the abstractness system
could potentially have twice as many data points as
the similarity system. The numbers in Table 1 in-
clude only the sentences with a minimum number of
data points. The evaluation results below do not take
into account sentences for which a system has insuf-
ficient representation. However, it is important to
note that the systems differ in how many sentences
they adequately represent, which means that some
(for example, the similarity system) are less able to
identify metaphor-in-language because they have a
less robust representation of the linguistic utterance.

For the purposes of this study, metaphor identifi-
cation was conceptualized as a sentence-level task.
For example, the systems evaluated here could be
used within a larger computational semantic sys-
tem to separate metaphoric and non-metaphoric sen-
tences for purposes of reasoning. One result of this
choice is that some of the original systems need to

be slightly reconceptualized; thus, it is better to say
that these systems are inspired by the cited systems,
rather than strict reimplementations of those sys-
tems. The similarity and abstractness systems orig-
inally were meant to decide which uses of a given
verb are metaphoric and which are not metaphoric.
In the present study, however, metaphor is not lim-
ited to verbs and the systems do not know which
words in the sentence may be metaphoric (e.g., it
could be any noun or any verb, etc.). Thus, these
systems have been altered to determine whether
there are any metaphorically used words anywhere
in the sentence. Further, all of the reconceptual-
ized systems compared here involve training or seed
metaphors, even those which were originally unsu-
pervised systems.

3 Identifying Metaphor-in-Language
Using Semantic Similarity

The semantic similarity system (Sporleder and Li,
2009; Li and Sporleder, 2010) uses pairwise seman-
tic similarity to detect metaphoric uses of words. As
conceptualized in this study, the system is designed
to detect whether any of the words in the sentence
are used metaphorically without knowing in advance
which words are candidates for metaphoric use.

While the original system used Normalized
Google Distance (Cilibrasi and Vitanyi, 2007)
to measure semantic similarity, the evaluation in
this study used Iosif’s SemSim system (Iosif and
Potamianos, 2012). There were two main reasons
for not using the NGD measure: (1) SemSim offers
more control because the corpus used to determine
pairwise similarity is known and can be made simi-
lar to the test corpus; (2) SemSim is more transpar-
ent in terms of its methodology and its results are
more stable over time. For this evaluation we used
the Open American National Corpus (henceforth,

2



OANC (Ide and Suderman, 2004)), which consists
of 14 million words taken from spoken and writ-
ten contemporary American English, to determine
the pairwise similarity values. Both the test corpus
and OANC were lemmatized and had common func-
tion words removed. Pairwise similarities were de-
termined for all words in the test corpus which oc-
curred 10 or more times, for a total of 1,691 words.
SemSim’s contextual window was set at 2. As with
all systems discussed below, Morpha (Guido, Car-
roll, and Pearce, 2001) was used for lemmatization
and OpenNLP (Apache, 2011) was used for named
entity recognition.

The variables used in the original system had to
be changed slightly because no particular word in
the sentence is given a special focus. The follow-
ing variables were used: (1) the number of similar-
ity measurements for a given sentence; (2) the aver-
age similarity; (3) the standard deviation of similar-
ity, in order to see how much divergence there was
from the average; (4) the highest pairwise similarity;
(5) the lowest pairwise similarity; (6) the difference
between the highest and lowest pairwise similarity.
One of the weaknesses of this particular implemen-
tation of the system is that it only considers words
that are adjacent to one another (with function words
removed). While the original system also used the
average pairwise similarity between the candidate
word and all other words, this was not possible here
given that there were no words starting as candi-
dates.

4 Identifying Metaphor-in-Language
Using Word Abstractness

The word abstractness system uses a measurement
of word abstractness to identify highly abstract con-
texts which are posited to be more likely to contain
metaphors. In the reconceptualization of the system
evaluated here there is also a focus on disparities in
abstractness ratings within a given sentence, so that
the mixture of abstract and concrete words can be
used to detect possible metaphors.

The system first rates lexical items according to
how abstract they are, on a scale from 0 to 1, with
1 being the most abstract. The approach to rating
abstraction is taken from (Turney, et al., 2011); a list
of rated lexical items is available from the authors.

The system tags the words in the sentence with their
parts of speech and finds the abstractness rating for
each; if an abstractness rating is not available for a
particular word form, the system attempts to find a
match for its lemmatized form. All words not found
on the list of abstractness ratings after these searches
were removed.

For each sentence a feature vector was created
that consisted of twelve different combinations of
abstractness ratings: (1) the number of abstractness
ratings available for the sentence; (2) the average ab-
stractness for all words; (3) the standard deviation
of the abstractness for all words; (3)-(4) the average
and standard deviation for the abstractness of nouns;
(5)-(6) the average and standard deviation for the ab-
stractness of verbs; (7)-(8) the average and standard
deviation for the abstractness of adjectives and ad-
verbs; (9)-(10) the highest and lowest abstractness in
the sentence; (11) the difference between the highest
and lowest abstractness; (12) the difference between
the average abstractness for nouns and for verbs.
Empty slots in the feature vector (e.g., if there were
no adjectives) were filled with a value of 0.5 for ab-
stractness, following the original system.

5 Identifying Metaphor-in-Language
Using Source-Target Mappings

The source-target mapping system clusters verbs
and nouns using their distributional properties and
argues that abstract nouns will cluster according to
the metaphoric source domains to which they are
connected. The system moves from the linguistic
utterance to the underlying conceptual mapping by
assuming that the verb directly represents the source
domain in the metaphoric mapping and that nouns
(functioning as the subject and/or object of the verb)
directly represent the target. Thus, the system looks
at grammatical relations containing a verb and a
noun and generalizes from seed metaphors to other
metaphors involving words from the same clusters.

The first part of evaluating the source-target map-
ping approach to metaphor identification was to
cluster lexical items. The method for clustering
verbs is described in (Sun and Korhonen, 2009);
(Sun, Korhonen, and Krymolowski, 2008) provide
a resource of the most frequent 1,510 English verbs
in the Gigaword corpus divided into 170 clusters.

3



These clusters were used in the evaluation. The pro-
cedure used for clustering nouns in (Shutova, Teufel,
and Korhonen, 2013) is to include the frequency of
grammatical relations (subject, object, indirect ob-
ject), as annotated by the RASP parser, in a feature
vector. In evaluating the source-target system, we
took a different approach to obtaining noun clus-
ters. Starting with 8,752 nouns examined by Iosif’s
SemSim system (Iosif and Potamianos, 2012), we
used a pairwise similarity matrix (measured using
the Google-based Semantic Relatedness metric, as
computed by Iosif) for the feature vector used for
clustering nouns. The nouns were divided into 200
clusters using Weka’s (Witten and Frank, 2005) im-
plementation of the k-means algorithm.

The search for metaphors was performed on the
RASP-parsed version of the evaluation corpus. A to-
tal of 1,000 randomly selected metaphoric sentences
were used as seed metaphors; any relation between
two different clusters was accepted as a candidate.
Many of the seed metaphoric utterances contained
multiple grammatically related clusters (e.g., verb-
object) which were candidates for the metaphoric
material in the utterance. In this evaluation we have
erred on the side of inclusion by searching for all
possible candidates. A total of 903 grammatical re-
lations between clusters were identified in the seed
sentences; no attempt was made to trim this num-
ber down. While the original system removed verbs
which have loose selectional restrictions, such verbs
were not removed from the clusters here; the origi-
nal system focuses on preventing false positives, but
in the evaluation here the focus is on preventing false
negatives, which such a reduction would necessarily
create.

6 Identifying Metaphor-in-Language
Using Domain Interactions

The domain interaction system (Dunn, 2013b)
is a knowledge-based system unlike the previ-
ous distributional-semantic systems. It identifies
metaphoric utterances using properties of the con-
cepts pointed to by lexical items in the utterance.
The system has two stages: first, determining what
concepts are present in an utterance and what their
properties are; second, using these properties to
model metaphor.

The system maps lexical items to their WordNet
synsets (WordNet, 2011) using the part of speech
tags to maintain a four-way distinction between
nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The system
then maps the WordNet synsets onto concepts in the
SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2001) using the
mappings provided (Niles and Pease, 2003). This
is done using the assumption that each lexical item
is used in its default sense, so that no disambigua-
tion takes place. Once the concepts present in the
utterance have been identified in this manner, using
the concepts present in the SUMO ontology, the sys-
tem uses domain (ABSTRACT, PHYSICAL, SOCIAL,
MENTAL) and event-status (PROCESS, STATE, OB-
JECT) properties of each concept present in the ut-
terance. These are not present as such in the SUMO
ontology, but were developed following Ontologi-
cal Semantics (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004) as a
knowledge-base specific to the system.

The domain interaction system was implemented
with a feature vector created using the properties
of the concepts referred to by lexical items in the
utterance. The feature vector uses the following
variables: (1) number of concepts in the utterance;
(2-5) number of instances of each type of domain
(ABSTRACT, PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, MENTAL); (6-
8) number of instances of each type of event sta-
tus (PROCESS, STATE, OBJECT); (9) number of in-
stances of the domain with the highest number of
instances; (10) number of instances of event-status
with the highest number of instances; (11) sum of
the individual domain variables minus (9); (12) sum
of individual event-status variables minus (10); (13)
number of domain types present at least once in the
utterance; (14) number of event-status types present
at least once in the utterance; (15) number of in-
stances of the main domain divided by the number
of concepts; (16) number of other domain instances
divided by the number of concepts; (17) number of
main event-status instances divided by the number
of concepts; (18) number of other event-status in-
stances divided by the number of concepts.

mantic similarity system had a minimum representa-
tion for many fewer sentences than does the abstract-
ness system, but those unrepresented sentences are
not held against the system. Three of the systems use
feature vectors: the semantic similarity, word ab-
stractness, and domain interaction systems. To make
the evaluation comparable all three systems are eval-
uated using Weka’s (Witten and Frank, 2005) imple-
mentation of the logistic regression algorithm, fol-
lowing (Turney, et al., 2011), using cross-validation
(100 folds) and a ridge estimator value of 0.2. The
evaluation of the source-target system searched for
the 903 seed relations in the RASP-parsed test cor-
pus. The sentences used as seeds were removed
from the test corpus before searching. For each
evaluation, the reported F-Measure is the weighted
average of the F-Measures for metaphors and non-
metaphors.

Table 2 shows the evaluation results for the four
systems on the entire corpus. The similarity system
has the highest number of true positives (5,936), but
also the highest number of false positives (4,214).
In fact, the similarity system identifies very few ut-
terances as non-metaphors and this makes the re-
sults rather unhelpful. The abstractness and do-
main interaction systems have similar F-measures
(0.582 and 0.583, respectively); both make a large
number of predictions for both metaphor and non-
metaphor, so that they attempt to distinguish be-
tween the two, but these predictions are not particu-
larly accurate. The source-target system stands out

here, as it does below, with a significantly smaller
number of false positives than the other systems
(785). At the same time, it also has a significantly
higher number of false negatives (5,496). The simi-
larity and source-target systems are on opposite ends
of the spectrum in terms of over-identifying and
under-identifying metaphor-in-language, and both
have similar F-measures (0.444 and 0.440, respec-
tively) which are lower than the abstractness and do-
main interaction systems.

In Table 3 the same results across all genres and
sub-types are presented for implementations with-
out Named Entity Recognition. The only system
which performs significantly differently is the ab-
stractness system, with an F-Measure of 0.482 with-
out vs. 0.582 with NER. This decline goes hand-in-
hand with the fact that the system with NER has suf-
ficient representation for a total of 14,454 sentences,
while without NER it has sufficient representation
for only 10,883 sentences.

Table 4 starts to break these results down further
by genre, in order to find out if the systems perform
differently on different sorts of texts. Every system
except for the similarity system (with F-measures of
0.444 and then 0.463) performs more poorly on fic-
tion than on the corpus as a whole. More interest-
ingly, within the fiction genre the similarity and ab-
stractness systems do not predict that any utterances
are non-metaphors, which makes their F-measures
largely meaningless. The source-target system con-
tinues to make a distinction between metaphor and

non-metaphor within this genre, although the true
and false positives (293 and 243, respectively) are
much closer to one another than when looking at the
corpus as a whole.

Table 5 looks at the systems’ performance within
the News genre. The similarity system, which above
made few predictions for non-metaphor continues
to predict only metaphors; the abstractness and do-
main interaction systems join it, predicting only
metaphors. The source-target system, on the other
hand, maintains a small number of false positives
(61), although continuing to show a large number of
false negatives (1,352). In terms of practical applica-
tions, the F-measures here do not adequately reflect
the fact that three of the four systems essentially fail
on this genre. One of the difficulties is the fact that
the News genre contains 1,708 metaphoric sentences
and 325 non-metaphoric sentences according to the
manual annotations in the VU Amsterdam Metaphor
Corpus; that means that 84% of the sentences are an-
notated as metaphoric.

Table 6 looks at the results within the Academic
genre. Here all systems make a distinction between
metaphor and non-metaphor; this is the first set on
which the similarity system has predicted a mean-
ingful number of non-metaphors. The source-target
system misses the most metaphors (1,321) but also
makes significantly fewer false positives (146 vs. the
next lowest 590 by the similarity system). The F-
measures do not adequately reflect the performance
of the systems for this genre.

Table 7 shows the results within the Conversation
genre. This is the reverse of the News genre: three of
the four systems make no predictions of metaphors.
This genre contains 1,958 utterances with at least
one metaphorically used word and 5,262 without.
Further, this genre contains many more short and/or
fragmentary sentences than the others. Even the
source-target system, which is the only system to
identify any metaphors, has more than twice as
many false positives as true positives (334 vs. 136,
respectively), which reverses its performance on the
three previous genres.

The initial conclusions we can draw from the
genre break-down is that (1) the F-measure does not
always reflect meaningful performance and thus that
the numbers of true and false positives and negatives
should be reported as well; and (2) that the perfor-
mance on the corpus as a whole disguises a large
amount of variation according to genre.

Table 8 shows the results for only the MRW-Met
sub-class in the corpus. This is the basic metaphor
sub-class in the corpus and the most common. The
systems perform better on this sub-class than on any
other. Interestingly, the source-target system makes
more false than true positives here (785 vs. 749) and
is the only system to make more false than true posi-
tives for this sub-class. It also makes more false neg-
atives than the other systems, although the abstract-
ness, source-target, and domain interaction systems
make a comparable number (3,971 and 3,990 and
3,386, respectively). The domain interaction system

makes the most true positives, although all the F-
measures are comparable (the lowest is only 0.062
below the highest).

Table 9 shows the results for the ambiguous
metaphors, under the label WIDLII, and the results
are comparable to the results for all other sub-classes
except for the MRW-Met sub-class (thus, the other
sub-classes will not be discussed individually). The
similarity, abstractness, and domain interaction sys-
tems do not detect any of these sentences as con-
taining metaphorically used words. In some ways
this failure is acceptable because the original ana-
lysts were not convinced that these utterances con-
tained metaphors in the first place. The source-target
system has a very uncharacteristic performance on
this sub-class, with 5-times as many false positives
as true positives (785 vs. 157, respectively).

This is interesting because it is exactly the op-
posite of the other systems, which do not predict
any sentences to be metaphors at all. This differ-
ence is likely a result of the fact that the other three
systems rely on feature vectors that were trained
on the WIDLII / Non-Metaphor distinction, while
the source-target system uses seed grammatical re-
lations from other sub-classes as well (it shouldn’t
matter because the relations are hypothesized to rep-
resent conceptual metaphors for which the sub-class
distinction is not relevant; more seed metaphors
were not used because this would have removed
them from the evaluation). In other words, the
sub-class comparisons try to distinguish between

WIDLII metaphors and non-metaphors in the cor-
pus. The source-target system was trained on one
and only one set of seed metaphors; in other cases
this fact increased the system’s performance, but in
this case it had the opposite effect. It also shows that
non-metaphors are more likely to contain the seed
clusters than are ambiguous metaphors.

8 Error Analysis

The next question to ask is whether these four sys-
tems succeed and fail on the same metaphors. Each
system makes different assumptions and is based on
a different theory of what linguistic properties are
essential to metaphor-in-language, and thus can be
used to distinguish metaphor from non-metaphor.

systems as measured by Fleiss’ Kappa. In the first
column, under “Full,” the predictions used to deter-
mine agreement differ slightly from the earlier pre-
dictions because all sentences were included, even
those for which a particular system lacked sufficient
representation. This was done in order to make
a comparison of the four systems possible (sen-
tences without representation could not be identified
as metaphors and thus defaulted to non-metaphors).
The sentences used as seeds for the source-target
system were removed for all systems. A possi-
ble cause for low agreement between the systems
is that if one system lacks sufficient representation
for a sentence, it will cause disagreement by its lack
of representation. The second column, under “Re-
duced,” shows the agreement between the four sys-
tems for only those sentences for which all systems
had an adequate representation and which were not
used for seed metaphors (a total of 8,887 sentences
rather than the full 16,202). The results are simi-
lar, showing that the low agreement is not caused by
lack of sufficient representation.

All of the divisions, whether by genre or by sub-
class, have a similarly low level of agreement, with
a range from 0.259 to 0.293. The sub-class of Dou-
ble metaphors has a higher agreement of 0.346. This
low agreement is the case even though the systems
have similar overall performance on these particular
genres and sub-classes. In other words, even though
the systems make similar numbers of correct predic-
tions, the particular utterances for which metaphor is

correctly or incorrectly predicted are not the same.
This is an important point because if all four

systems succeeded and failed on the same utter-
ances then we could say that those particular ut-
terances were the cause of the failure and try to
model the properties of those utterances. What
seems to be happening is quite the opposite: each
system implements a particular model of metaphor-
in-language which makes specific explicit and im-
plicit assumptions about what metaphor-in-language
is and what properties are essential for distinguish-
ing metaphoric language from non-metaphoric lan-
guage. These different models seem to be succeed-
ing on those metaphors which fall within their scope
and failing on all others, which leads to disagree-
ment in the predictions of the systems.

9 Synthesizing the Systems

Several meta-systems were constructed using the re-
sults of the four systems on the sub-set of the cor-
pus for which each system had adequate representa-
tion (8,887 sentences). The first meta-system iden-
tified as metaphor only those sentences which the
two top-performing systems, the source-target map-
ping and the domain interaction systems, agreed
were metaphoric; the second only those sentences
which all four systems agreed were metaphoric; the
third only those sentences which a majority of sys-
tems agreed were metaphoric; the fourth those sen-
tences for which either the domain interaction or

the source-target system identified as metaphor; the
fifth all sentences which the domain interaction and
source-target systems agreed were metaphoric, us-
ing the similarity and abstractness systems to resolve
disagreement. There are two versions of this last
meta-system: the inclusive version identifies dis-
puted sentences as metaphoric if either the similarity
or abstractness system does, and the exclusive ver-
sion only if the two agree.

Table 11 shows the results of the evaluations of
these meta-systems. The system with the fewest
false positives is the one which requires four-
way agreement before an utterance is identified as
metaphor; however, this also has the fewest true
positives. The performance of the exclusive meta-
system for the top two systems has a better propor-
tion of true to false positives, but also has an unfor-
tunately high number of false negatives. The major-
ity vote meta-system has more false than true pos-
itives and, thus, is not successful. The last three
meta-systems differ in how they resolve disagree-
ments between the top two systems; there is a con-
sistent trade-off between more true positives and
fewer false positives and all three have comparable
F-measures.

10 What This Tells Us About
Metaphor-in-Language

What can we learn about metaphor-in-language
from the successes and failures of these four
metaphor identification systems? First, there is a
significant difference between genres. The linguistic
properties which can distinguish metaphors in one
genre may not apply to other genres. Or, looked
at another way, different genres are more likely to
contain different types of metaphors (the types of
metaphor referred to here involve different sources

of metaphoric meaning and are not comparable to
the corpus’s sub-classes).

Second, the predictions of the four systems, re-
gardless of their accuracy, have a relatively low level
of agreement. This low level of agreement is consis-
tent across genres and sub-classes. This means that
the systems are succeeding and failing on different
metaphors. Each of the systems is based on a differ-
ent theory of metaphor-in-language. The combina-
tion of these two facts suggests that different types
of metaphor have different linguistic properties.

Most theories of metaphor conceive of it as a
single and coherent phenomenon, so that the pre-
dictions of competing theories are mutually exclu-
sive. The lack of agreement coupled with similar
success rates, however, suggests that these theories
of metaphor-in-language are not mutually exclusive
but rather apply to different types of metaphor-in-
language. If this is the case, then a more accu-
rate model of metaphor-in-language will start by
positing a number of different types of metaphor-
in-language, which differ in the source of their
metaphoric meaning, and then predicting what lin-
guistic properties can be used to distinguish among
these types and between them and non-metaphors.

Metaphor identification systems can be im-
proved by focusing on two important properties of
metaphor-in-language: First, metaphors are gradi-
ent, with some being much more metaphoric than
others (Dunn, 2011). One problem with the sys-
tems described in this paper is that they are forced
to draw an arbitrary line between two classes to rep-
resent a gradient phenomenon. Second, metaphoric
expressions receive their metaphoric meaning from
different sources (Dunn, 2013a). These different
types of metaphor-in-language have different prop-
erties and should be modeled individually.
