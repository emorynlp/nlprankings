Abstract

This study presents a novel method that
measures English language learners’ syntac-
tic competence towards improving automated
speech scoring systems. In contrast to most
previous studies which focus on the length of
production units such as the mean length of
clauses, we focused on capturing the differ-
ences in the distribution of morpho-syntactic
features or grammatical expressions across
proficiency. We estimated the syntactic com-
petence through the use of corpus-based NLP
techniques. Assuming that the range and so-
phistication of grammatical expressions can
be captured by the distribution of Part-of-
Speech (POS) tags, vector space models of
POS tags were constructed. We use a large
corpus of English learners’ responses that are
classified into four proficiency levels by hu-
man raters. Our proposed feature measures
the similarity of a given response with the
most proficient group and is then estimates the
learner’s syntactic competence level.

Widely outperforming the state-of-the-art
measures of syntactic complexity, our method
attained a significant correlation with human-
rated scores. The correlation between human-
rated scores and features based on manual
transcription was 0.43 and the same based on
ASR-hypothesis was slightly lower, 0.42. An
important advantage of our method is its ro-
bustness against speech recognition errors not
to mention the simplicity of feature genera-
tion that captures a reasonable set of learner-
specific syntactic errors.

1 Introduction

This study provides a novel method that measures
ESL (English as a second language) learners’ com-
petence in grammar usage (syntactic competence).
Being interdisciplinary in nature, it shows how to
combine the core findings in the ESL literature with
various empirical NLP techniques for the purpose of
automated scoring.

Grammar usage is one of the dimensions of lan-
guage ability that is assessed during non-native pro-
ficiency level testing in a foreign language. Overall
proficiency in the target language can be assessed
by testing the abilities in various areas including flu-
ency, pronunciation, and intonation; grammar and
vocabulary; and discourse structure. Testing rubrics
for human raters contain descriptors used for the
subjective assessment of several of these features.
With the recent move towards the objective assess-
ment of language ability (spoken and written), it is
imperative that we develop methods for quantifying
these abilities and measuring them automatically.

Ortega (2003) indicated that “the range of forms
that surface in language production and the degree
of sophistication of such forms” were two impor-
tant areas in grammar usage and called the combina-
tion of these two areas “syntactic complexity.” Fea-
tures that measure syntactic complexity have been
frequently studied in ESL literature and have been
found to be highly correlated with students’ profi-
ciency levels in writing.

Studies in automated speech scoring have focused
on fluency (Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Cucchiarini et
al., 2002), pronunciation (Witt and Young, 1997;

600



Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 1997; Neumeyer et al.,
2000), and intonation (Zechner et al., 2009), and rel-
atively fewer studies have been conducted on gram-
mar usage. More recently, Lu (2010), Chen and
Yoon (2011) and Chen and Zechner (2011) have
measured syntactic competence in speech scoring.
Chen and Yoon (2011) estimated the complexity of
sentences based on the average length of the clauses
or sentences. In addition to these length measures,
Lu (2010) and Chen and Zechner (2011) measured
the parse-tree based features such as the mean depth
of parsing tree levels. However, these studies found
that these measures did not show satisfactory empir-
ical performance in automatic speech scoring (Chen
and Yoon, 2011; Chen and Zechner, 2011) when the
features were calculated from the output of a speech
recognition engine.

This study considers new features that measure
syntactic complexity and is novel in two important
ways. First, in contrast to most features that in-
fer syntactic complexity based upon the length of
the unit, we directly measure students’ sophistica-
tion and range in grammar usage. Second, instead
of rating a student’s response using a scale based on
native speech production, our experiments compare
it with a similar body of learners’ speech. Elicit-
ing native speakers’ data and rating it for grammar
usage (supervised approach) can be arbitrary, since
there can be a very wide range of possible grammat-
ical structures that native speakers utilize. Instead,
we proceed in a semi-supervised fashion. A large
amount of learners’ spoken responses were collected
and classified into four groups according to their
proficiency level. We then sought to find how dis-
tinct the proficiency classes were based on the distri-
bution of POS tags. Given a student’s response, we
calculated the similarity with a sample of responses
for each score level based on the proportion and dis-
tribution of Part-of-Speech using NLP techniques.

POS tag distribution has been used in various
tasks such as text genre classification (Feldman et
al., 2009); in a language testing context, it has been
used in grammatical error detection (Chodorow and
Leacock, 2000; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008) and
essay scoring. Recently, Roark et al. (2011) ex-
plored POS tag distribution to capture the differ-
ences in syntactic complexity between healthy sub-
jects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment,

but no other research has used POS tag distribution
in measuring syntactic complexity, to the best of au-
thors’ knowledge.

An assessment of ESL learners’ syntactic compe-
tence should consider the structure of sentences as a
whole - a task which may not be captured by the sim-
plistic POS tag distribution. However, studies of Lu
(2010) and Chen and Zechner (2011) showed that
more complex syntactic features are unreliable in
ASR-based scoring system. Furthermore, we show
that POS unigrams or bigrams indeed capture a rea-
sonable portion of learners’ range and sophistication
of grammar usage in our discussion in Section 7.

This paper will proceed as follows: we will re-
view related work in Section 2 and present the
method to calculate syntactic complexity in Section
3. Data and experiment setup will be explained in
Section 4 and Section 5. The results will be pre-
sented in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we discuss
the levels of syntactic competence that are captured
using our proposed measure.

2 Related Work

Second Language Acquisition (SLA) researchers
have developed many quantitative measures to es-
timate the level of acquisition of syntactic compe-
tence. Bardovi-Harlig and Bofman (1989) classi-
fied these measures into two groups. The first group
is related to the acquisition of specific morphosyn-
tactic features or grammatical expressions. Tests of
negations or relative clauses - whether these expres-
sions occurred in the test responses without errors -
fell into this group (hereafter, the expression-based
group). The second group is related to the length of
the clause or the relationship between clauses and
hence not tied to particular structures (hereafter, the
length-based group). Examples of the second group
measures include the average length of clause unit
and dependent clauses per sentence unit.

These syntactic measures have been extensively
studied in ESL writing. Ortega (2003) synthesized
25 research studies which employed syntactic mea-
sures on ESL writing and reported a significant re-
lationship between the proposed features and writ-
ing proficiency. He reported that a subset of features
such as the mean length of the clause unit increased
with students’ proficiency. More recently, Lu (2010)

601



has conducted a more systematic study using an au-
tomated system. He applied 14 syntactic measures
to a large database of Chinese learners’ writing sam-
ples and found that syntactic measures were strong
predictors of students’ writing proficiency.

Studies in the area of automated speech scor-
ing have only recently begun to actively investi-
gate the usefulness of syntactic measures for scoring
spontaneous speech (Chen et al., 2010; Bernstein
et al., 2010). These have identified clause bound-
aries (identified from manual annotations and au-
tomatically) and obtained length-based features. In
addition to these conventional syntactic complexity
features, Lu (2009) implemented an automated sys-
tem that calculates the revised Developmental Level
(D-Level) Scale (Covington et al., 2006) using nat-
ural language processing (NLP) techniques. The
original D-Level Scale was proposed by Rosenberg
and Abbeduto (1987) based primarily on observa-
tions of child language acquisition. They classified
children’s grammatical acquisition into 7 different
groups according to the presence of certain types of
complex sentences. The revised D-Level Scale clas-
sified sentences into the eight levels according to the
presence of particular grammatical expressions. For
instance, level 0 is comprised of simple sentences,
while level 5 is comprised of sentences joined by
subordinating conjunction or nonfinite clauses in an
adjunct position. The D-Level Scale has been less
studied in the speech scoring. To our knowledge,
Chen and Zechner (2011) is the only study that ap-
plied the D-Level analyzer to ESL learners’ spoken
responses.

In contrast to ESL writing, applying syntactic
complexity features, both conventional length-based
features and D-Level features, presents serious ob-
stacles for speaking. First, the length of the spo-
ken responses are typically shorter than written re-
sponses. Most measures are based on sentence or
sentence-like units, and in speaking tests that elicit
only a few sentences the measures are less reli-
able. Chen and Yoon (2011) observed a marked
decrease in correlation between syntactic measures
and proficiency as response length decreased. In
addition, speech recognition errors only worsen the
situation. Chen and Zechner (2011) showed that
the significant correlation between syntactic mea-
sures and speech proficiency (correlation coefficient

= 0.49) became insignificant when they were applied
to the speech recognition word hypotheses. Errors
in speech recognition seriously influenced the mea-
sures and decreased the performance. Due to these
problems, the existing syntactic measures do not
seem reliable enough for being used in automated
speech proficiency scoring.

In this study, we propose novel syntactic measures
which are relatively robust against speech recogni-
tion errors and are reliable in short responses. In
contrast to recent studies focusing on length-based
features, we focus on capturing differences in the
distribution of morphosyntactic features or gram-
matical expressions across proficiency levels. We in-
vestigate the distribution of a broader class of gram-
matical forms through the use of corpus-based NLP
techniques.

3 Method

Many previous studies, that assess syntactic com-
plexity based on the distribution of morpho-
syntactic features and grammatical expressions, lim-
ited their experiments to a few grammatical expres-
sions. Covington et al. (2006) and Lu (2009) cov-
ered all sentence types, but their approaches were
based on expert observation (supervised rubrics),
and descriptions of each level were brief and ab-
stract. It is important to develop a more detailed and
refined scale, but developing scales in a supervised
way is difficult due to the subjectivity and the com-
plexity of structures involved.

In order to overcome this problem, we employed
NLP technology and a corpus-based approach. We
hypothesize that the level of acquired grammatical
forms is signaled by the distribution of the POS tags,
and the differences in grammatical proficiency re-
sult in differences in POS tag distribution. Based on
this assumption, we collected large amount of ESL
learners’ spoken responses and classified them into
four groups according to their proficiency levels.
The syntactic competence was estimated based on
the similarity between the test responses and learn-
ers’ corpus.

A POS-based vector space model (VSM), in
which the response belonging to separate profi-
ciency levels were converted to vectors and the sim-
ilarity between vectors were calculated using cosine

602



similarity measure and tf-idf weighting, was em-
ployed. Such a score-category-based VSM has been
used in automated essay scoring. Attali and Burstein
(2006) to assess the lexical content of an essay by
comparing the words in the test essay with the words
in a sample essays from each score category. We
extend this to assessment of grammar usage using
vectors of POS tags.

Proficient speakers use complicated grammati-
cal expressions, while beginners use simple expres-
sions and sentences with frequent grammatical er-
rors. POS tags (or sequences) capturing these ex-
pressions may be seen in corresponding proportions
in each score group. These distributional differences
are captured by inverse-document frequency.

In addition, we identify frequent POS tag se-
quences as those having high mutual information
and include them in our experiments. Temple (2000)
pointed out that the proficient learners are charac-
terized by increased automaticity in speech produc-
tion. These speakers tend to memorize frequently
used multi-word sequences as a chunk and retrieve
the whole chunk as a single unit. The degree of auto-
maticity can be captured by the frequent occurrence
of POS sequences with high mutual information.

We quantify the usefulness of the generated fea-
tures for the purpose of automatic scoring by first
considering its correlation with the human scores.
We then compare the performance of our features
with those in Lu (2011), where the features are a
collection of measures of syntactic complexity that
have shown promising directions in previous stud-
ies.

4 Data

Two different sets of data were used in this study:
the AEST 48K dataset and AEST balanced dataset.
Both were collections of responses from the AEST,
a high-stakes test of English proficiency and had
no overlaps. The AEST assessment consists of 6
items in which speakers are prompted to provide re-
sponses lasting between 45 and 60 seconds per item.
In summary, approximately 3 minutes of speech is
collected per speaker.

Among the 6 items, two items are tasks that ask
examinees to provide information or opinions on fa-
miliar topics based on their personal experience or

background knowledge. The four remaining items
are integrated tasks that include other language skills
such as listening and reading. All items extract
spontaneous, unconstrained natural speech. The
size, purpose, and speakers’ native language infor-
mation for each dataset is summarized in Table 1.

Each response was rated by trained human raters
using a 4-point scoring scale, where 1 indicates
a low speaking proficiency and 4 indicates a high
speaking proficiency. In order to evaluate the relia-
bility of the human ratings, the data should be scored
by two raters. Since none of the AEST balanced
data was double scored the inter-rater agreement ra-
tio was estimated using a large (41K) double-scored
dataset using the same scoring guidelines and scor-
ing process. The Pearson correlation coefficient was
0.63 suggesting a reasonable inter-rater agreement.
The distribution of the scores for this data can be
found in Table 2.

We used the AEST 48K dataset as the training
data and the AEST balanced dataset as the evalua-
tion data.

5 Experiments

5.1 Overview

Our experimental procedure is as follows. All tran-
scriptions were tagged using the POS tagger de-
scribed in Section 5.3 and POS tag sequences were
extracted. Next, the POS-based VSMs (one for
each score class) were created using the AEST 48K
dataset. Finally, for a given test response in the
AEST balanced dataset, similarity features were
generated.

A score-class-specific POS-based VSM was cre-
ated using POS tags generated from the manual tran-
scriptions. For evaluation, two different types of
transcriptions (manual transcription and word hy-
potheses from the speech recognizer described in
Section 5.2) were used in order to investigate the in-
fluence of speech recognition errors in the feature
performance.

of bigram, trigram, and four-gram language models
were used. The word error rate (WER) on the held-
out test dataset was 27%.

5.3 POS tagger

POS tags were generated using the POS tagger im-
plemented in the OpenNLP toolkit. It was trained
on the Switchboard (SWBD) corpus. This POS tag-
ger was trained on about 528K word/tag pairs and
achieved a tagging accuracy of 96.3% on a test set
of 379K words. The Penn POS tag set was used in
the tagger.

5.4 Unit generation using mutual information

POS bigrams with high mutual information were se-
lected and used as a single unit. First, all POS bi-
grams which occurred less than 50 times were fil-
tered out. Next, the remaining POS tag bigrams
were sorted by their mutual information scores, and
two different sets (top50 and top110) were selected.
The selected POS pairs were transformed into com-
pound tags. As a result, we generated three sets
of POS units by this process: the original POS set
without the compound unit (Base), the original set
and an additional 50 compound units (Base+mi50),
and the original set and an additional 110 units
(Base+mi110).

Finally, unigram, bigram and trigram were gener-
ated for each set separately. The size of total terms
in each condition was presented in table 3.

Base Base+mi50 Base+mi110
Unigram 42 93 151
Bigram 1366 4284 9691
Trigram 21918 54856 135430

5.5 Building VSMs

For each ngram, three sets of VSMs were built us-
ing three sets of tags as terms, yielding a total of
nine VSMs. The results were based on the individ-
ual model and we did not combine any models.

5.6 Cosine similarity-based features

The cosine similarity has been frequently used in
the information retrieval field to identify the relevant
documents for the given query. This measures the
similarity between a given query and a document by
measuring the cosine of the angle between vectors in
a high-dimensional space, whereby each term in the
query and documents corresponding to a unique di-
mension. If a document is relevant to the query, then
it shares many terms resulting in a small angle. In
this study, the term was a single or compound POS
tag (unigram,bigram or trigram) weighted by its tf-
idf, and the document was the response.

First, the inverse document frequency was calcu-
lated from the training data, and each response was
treated as a document. Next, responses in the same

was generated for each score group. A total of 4

where ~q is a vector of the test response,
~dj is a vector of the scoreGroupj ,
n is the total number of POS tags,
tf(ti, ~q) is the term frequency of POS tag ti in the
test response,
tf(ti, ~dj) is the term frequency of POS tag ti in the
scoreGroupj ,
N is the total number of training responses,
df(ti) is the document frequency of POS tag ti in
the total training responses

Finally, a total of 4 cos scores (one per score
group) were generated. Among these four values,
the cos4, the similarity score to the responses in the
score group 4, was selected as a feature with the fol-
lowing intuition. cos4 measures the similarity of a
given test response to the representative vector of
score class 4; the larger the value, the closer it would
be to score class 4.

6 Results

6.1 Correlation
Table 4 shows correlations between cosine similarity
features and proficiency scores rated by experts.

The bigram-based features outperformed both
unigram-based and trigram-based features. In par-
ticular, the similarities using the base tag set with
bigrams achieved the best performance. By adding
the mutual information-based compound units to the
original POS tag sets, the performance of features
improved in the unigram models. However, there
was no performance gain in either bigram or tri-
gram models; on the contrary, there was a large
drop in performance. Unigrams have good coverage
but limited power in distinguishing different score
levels. On the other hand, trigrams have opposite
characteristics. Bigrams seem to strike a balance
in both coverage and complexity (from among the
three considered here) and may thus have resulted in
the best performace.

The performance of ASR-based features were
comparable to that of transcription-based features.
The best performing feature among ASR-based-
features were from the bigram and base set, with
correlations nearly the same as the best performing
one among the transcription-based-features. See-
ing how close the correlations were in the case of
transcription-based and ASR-hypothesis based fea-
ture extraction, we conclude that the proposed mea-
sure is robust to ASR errors.

6.2 Comparison with other Measures of
Syntactic Complexity

We compared the performance of our features with
the features of syntactic complexity proposed in (Lu,
2011). Towards this, the clause boundaries of the
ASR hypotheses, were automatically detected using
the automated clause boundary detection method1.

1The automated clause boundary detection method in this
study was a Maximum Entropy Model based on word bigrams,
POS tag bigrams, and pause features. The method achieved an

605



The utterances were then parsed using the Stanford
Parser, and a total of 22 features including both
length-related features and parse-tree based features
were generated using (Lu, 2011). Finally, we calcu-
lated Pearson correlation coefficients between these
features and human proficiency scores.

Current study bigram based cos4 0.41**

(Lu, 2011) DCC 0.14**

Table 5: Comparison between (Lu, 2011) and this study
** Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level

As indicated in Table 5, the best performing fea-
ture was mean number of dependent clauses per
clause (DCC) and the correlation r was 0.14. No
features other than DCC achieved statistically sig-
nificant correlation. Our best performing feature (bi-
gram based cos4) widely outperformed the best of
Lu (2011)’s features (correlations approximately 0.3
apart).

A logical explanation for the poor performance of
Lu (2011)’s features is that the features are gener-
ated using multi-stage automated process, and the
errors in each process contributes the low feature
performance. For instance, the errors in the auto-
mated clause boundary detection may result in a se-
rious drop in the performance. With the spoken re-
sponses being particularly short (a typical response
in the data set had 10 clauses on average), even one
error in clause boundary detection can seriously af-
fect the reliability of features.

7 Discussion

While the measure of syntactic competence that we
study here is an abstraction of the overall syntactic
competence, without consideration of specific con-
structions, we analyzed the results further with the
intention of casting light on the level of details of
syntactic competence that can be explained using
our measure. Furthermore, this section will show
that bigram POS sequences can yield significant in-
formation on the range and sophistication of gram-
mar usage in the specific assessment context (spon-

F-score of 0.60 on the non-native speakers’ ASR hypotheses.
A detailed description of the method is presented in (Chen and
Zechner, 2011)

taneous speech comprised of only declarative sen-
tences).

ESL speakers with high proficiency scores are ex-
pected to use more complicated grammatical expres-
sions that result in a high proportion of POS tags
related to these expressions in that score group. The
distribution of POS tags was analyzed in detail in or-
der to investigate whether there were systematic dis-
tributional changes according to proficiency levels.
Owing to space constraints, we restrict our discus-
sion to the analysis using unigrams (base and com-
pund). For each score group, the POS tags were
sorted based on the frequencies in training data, and
the rank orders were calculated. The more frequent
the POS tag, the higher its rank.

A total of 150 POS tags, including the original
POS tag set and top 110 compound tags, were clas-
sified into 5 classes:

• Absence-of-low-proficiency (ABS): Group of
POS tags that appear in all score groups except
the lowest proficiency group;

• Increase (INC): Group of POS tags whose
ranks increase consistently as proficiency in-
creases;

• Decrease (DEC): Group of POS tags whose
ranks decrease consistently as proficiency in-
creases;

• Constant (CON): Group of POS tags whose
ranks remain same despite change in profi-
ciency;

• Mix: Group of POS tags of with no consistent
pattern in the ranks.

Table 6 presents the number of POS tags in each
class.

ABS INC DEC CON Mix
14 37 33 18 48

Table 6: Tag distribution and proficiency scores

The ‘ABS’ class mostly consists of ‘WP’ and
‘WDT’; more than 50% of tags in this class are re-
lated to these two tags. ‘WP’ is a Wh-pronoun while
‘WDT’ is a Wh-determiner. Since most sentences in

606



our data are declarative sentences, ‘Wh’ phrase sig-
nals the use of relative clause. Therefore, the lack
of these tags strongly support the hypothesis that the
speakers in score group 1 showed incompetence in
the use of relative clauses or their use in limited sit-
uations.

The ‘INC’ class can be sub-classified into three
groups: verb, comparative, and relative clause. Verb
group is includes the infinitive (TO VB), passive
(VB VBN, VBD VBN, VBN, VBN IN, VBN RP),
and gerund forms (VBG, VBG RP, VBG TO). Next,
the comparative group encompasses comparative
constructions. Finally, the relative clause group sig-
nals the presence of relative clauses. The increased
proportion of these tags reflects the use of more
complicated tense forms and modal forms as well
as more frequent use of relative clauses. It supports
the hypothesis that speakers with higher proficiency
scores tend to use more complicated grammatical
expressions.

The ‘DEC’ class can be sub-classified into five
groups: noun, simple tense verb, GW and UH,
non-compound, and comparative. The noun group
is comprised of many noun or proper noun-related
expressions, and their high proportions are consis-
tent with the tendency that less proficient speakers
use nouns more frequently. Secondly, the simple
tense verb group is comprised of the base form (VB)
and simple present and past forms(PRP VBD, VB,
VBD TO, VBP TO, VBZ). The expressions in these
groups are simpler than those in ‘Increase’ group.

The ‘UH’ tag is for interjection and filler words
such as ‘uh’ and ‘um’, while the ‘GW’ tag is for
word-fragments. These two spontaneous speech
phenomena are strongly related to fluency, and it
signals problems in speech production. Frequent
occurrences of these two tags are evidence of fre-
quent planning problems and their inclusion in the
‘DEC’ class suggests that instances of speech plan-
ning problems decrease with increased proficiency.

Tags in the non-compound group, such as ‘DT’,
‘MD’, ‘RBS’, and ‘TO’, have related compound
tags. The non-compound tags are associated with
the expressions that do not co-occur with strongly
related words, and they tend to be related to errors.
For instance, the non-compound ‘MD’ tag signals
that there is an expression that a modal verb is not
followed by ‘VB’ (base form) and as seen in the ex-

amples, ‘the project may can change’ and ‘the others
must can not be good’, they are related to grammat-
ical errors.

Finally, the comparative group includes
‘RBR JJR’. The decrease of ‘RBR JJR’ is re-
lated to the correct acquisition of the comparative
form. ‘RBR’ is for comparative adverbs and ‘JJR’ is
for comparative adjectives, and the combination of
two tags is strongly related to double-marked errors
such as ‘more easier’. In the intermediate stage in
the acquisition of comparative form, learners tend
to use the double-marked form. The compound tags
correctly capture this erroneous stage.

The ‘Decrease’ class also includes three Wh-
related tags (WDT NN, WDT VBP, WRB), but the
proportion is much smaller than the ‘Increase’ class.

The above analysis shows that the combination of
original and compound POS tags correctly capture
systematic changes in the grammatical expressions
according to changes in proficiency levels.

The robust performance of our proposed mea-
sure to speech recognition errors may be better ap-
preciated in the context of similar studies. Com-
pared with the state-of-the art measures of syntac-
tic complexity proposed in Lu (2011) our features
achieve significantly better performance especially
when generated from ASR hypotheses. It is to
be noted that the performance drop between the
transcription-based feature and the ASR hypothesis-
based feature was marginal.

8 Conclusions

In this paper, we presented features that measure
syntactic competence for the automated speech scor-
ing. The features measured the range and sophisti-
cation of grammatical expressions based on POS tag
distributions. A corpus with a large number of learn-
ers’ responses was collected and classified into four
groups according to proficiency levels. The syntac-
tic competence of the test response was estimated by
identifying the most similar group from the learners’
corpus. Furthermore, speech recognition errors only
resulted in a minor performance drop. The robust-
ness against speech recognition errors is an impor-
tant advantage of our method.
