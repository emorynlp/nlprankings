Abstract 
Social media platforms have enabled people to 
freely express their views and discuss issues of 
interest with others. While it is important to dis-
cover the topics in discussions, it is equally use-
ful to mine the nature of such discussions or de-
bates and the behavior of the participants. There 
are many questions that can be asked. One key 
question is whether the participants give rea-
soned arguments with justifiable claims via 
constructive debates or exhibit dogmatism and 
egotistic clashes of ideologies. The central idea 
of this question is tolerance, which is a key 
concept in the field of communications. In this 
work, we perform a computational study of tol-
erance in the context of online discussions. We 
aim to identify tolerant vs. intolerant partici-
pants and investigate how disagreement affects 
tolerance in discussions in a quantitative 
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first such study. Our experiments using 
real-life discussions demonstrate the effective-
ness of the proposed technique and also provide 
some key insights into the psycholinguistic 
phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions. 

1 Introduction 
Social media platforms have enabled people 
from anywhere in the world to express their 
views and discuss any issue of interest in online 
discussions/debates. Existing works in this con-
text include recognition of support and oppose 
camps (Agrawal et al., 2003), mining of authori-
ties and subgroups (Mayfield and Rosè, 2011; 
Abu-Jbara et al. (2012), dialogue act segmenta-
tion and classification (Morbini and Sagae, 2011; 
Boyer et al., 2011), etc. 

This paper probes further to study a different 
and important angle, i.e., the psycholinguistic 
phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions. 
Tolerance is an important concept in the field of 
communications. It is a subfacet of deliberation 
which refers to critical thinking and exchange of 
rational arguments on an issue among partici-
pants that seek to achieve consensus/solution 

(Habermas, 1984). 
Perhaps the most widely accepted definition 

of tolerance is that of Gastil (2005; 2007), who 
defines tolerance as a means to engage (in writ-
ten or spoken communication) in critical think-
ing, judicious argument, sound reasoning, and 
justifiable claims through constructive discus-
sion as opposed to mere coercion/egotistic clash-
es of ideologies.  

In this work, we adopt this definition, and also 
employ the following characteristics of tolerance 
(also known as “code of conduct”) (Crocker, 
2005; Gutmann and Thompson, 1996) to guide 
our work.  
Reciprocity: Each member (or participant) offers 

proposals and justifications in terms that others 
could understand and accept. 

Publicity: Each member engages in a process 
that is transparent to all and each member 
knows with whom he is agreeing or disagree-
ing.  

Accountability: Each member gives acceptable 
and sound reasons to others on the various 
claims or proposals suggested by him. 

Mutual respect and civic integrity: Each mem-
ber’s speech should be morally acceptable, i.e., 
using proper language irrespective of agree-
ment or disagreement of views. 

The issue of tolerance has been actively re-
searched in the field of communications for the 
past two decades, and has been investigated in 
multiple dimensions. However, existing studies 
are typically qualitative and focus on theorizing 
the socio-linguistic aspects of tolerance (more 
details in §2).  

With the rapid growth of social media, the 
large volumes of online discussions/debates offer 
a golden opportunity to investigate people’s im-
plicit psyche in discussions quantitatively based 
on the real-life data, i.e., their tolerance levels 
and their arguing nature, which are of fundamen-
tal interest to several fields, e.g., communica-
tions, marketing, politics, and sociology 
(Dahlgren, 2005; Gastil, 2005; Moxey and 

1680



Sanford, 2000). Communication and political 
scholars are hopeful that technologies capable of 
identifying tolerance levels of people on social 
issues (often discussed in online discussions) can 
render vital statistics which can be used in pre-
dicting political outcomes in elections and help-
ful in tailoring voting campaigns and agendas to 
maximize winning chances (Dahlgren, 2002). 
Objective: The objective of this work is two-
fold:  
1. Identifying tolerant and intolerant participants 

in discussions.  
2. Analyzing how disagreement affects toler-

ance and estimating the tipping point of such 
effects.  

To the best of our knowledge, these tasks have 
not been attempted quantitatively before. The 
first task is a classification/prediction problem. 
Due to the complex and interactive nature of dis-
cussions, the traditional n-gram features are no 
longer sufficient for accurate classification. We 
thus propose a generative model, called DTM, to 
discover some key pieces of information which 
characterize the nature of discussions and their 
participants, e.g., the arguing nature (agreeing 
vs. disagreeing), topic and expression distribu-
tions. These allow us to generate a set of novel 
features from the estimated latent variables of 
DTM capable of capturing authors’ tolerance 
psyche during discussions. The features are then 
used in learning to identify tolerant and intoler-
ant authors. Our experimental results show that 
the proposed approach is effective and outper-
forms several strong baselines significantly. 

The second task studies the interplay of toler-
ance and disagreement. It is well-known that 
tolerance facilitates constructive disagreements, 
but sustained disagreements often result in a 
transition to destructive disagreement leading to 
polarization and intolerance (Dahlgren, 2005). 
An interesting question is: What is the tipping 
point of disagreement to exhibit intolerance? We 
take a Bayesian approach to seek an answer and 
discover issue-specific tipping points. Our em-
pirical results discover some interesting relation-
ships which are supported by theoretical studies 
in psychology and linguistic communications. 

Finally, this work also produces an annotated 
corpus of tolerant and intolerant users in online 
discussions across two domains: politics and re-
ligion. We believe this is the first such dataset 
and will be a valuable resource to the communi-
ty. 

2 Related Work 
Although limited work has been done on analy-
sis of tolerance in online discussions, there are 
several general research areas that are related to 
our work.  
Communications: Tolerance has been an active 
research area in the field of communications for 
the past two decades. Ryfe (2005) provided a 
comprehensive survey of the literature. The topic 
has been studied in multiple dimensions, e.g., 
opinion and attitude (Luskin et al., 2004; Price et 
al., 2002), public engagement (Escobar, 2012), 
psychoanalysis (Slavin and Kriegman, 1992), 
argument repertoire (Cappella et al., 2002), etc. 

Tolerance has also been investigated in the 
domain of political communications with an em-
phasis on political sophistication (Gastil and 
Dillard, 1999), civic culture (Dahlgren, 2002), 
and democracy (Fishkin, 1991). These existing 
works study tolerance from the qualitative per-
spective. Our focus is quantitative analysis. 
Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis deter-
mines positive or negative opinions expressed on 
topics (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). Main 
tasks include aspect extraction (Hu and Liu, 
2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Mukherjee and 
Liu, 2012c; Chen et al., 2013), opinion polarity 
identification (Hassan and Radev, 2010; Choi 
and Cardie, 2010) and subjectivity analysis 
(Wiebe, 2000). Although related, tolerance is 
different from sentiment. Sentiments are mainly 
indicated by sentiment terms (e.g., great, good, 
bad, and poor). Tolerance in discussions refers 
to the reception of certain views and often indi-
cated by agreement and disagreement expres-
sions and other features (§5). 
Online discussions or debates: Several works 
put authors in debate into support and oppose 
camps. Agrawal et al. (2003) used a graph based 
method, and Murakami and Raymond (2010) 
used a rule-based method. In (Mukherjee and 
Liu, 2012a), contention points were identified, in 
(Mukherjee and Liu, 2012b), various expressions 
in review comment discussions were mined, and 
in (Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003), 
speaker utterances were classified into agree-
ment, disagreement, and backchannel classes. 
Also related are studies on linguistic style ac-
commodation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012d) and 
user pair interactions (Mukherjee and Liu, 2013) 
in online debates. However, these works do not 
consider tolerance analysis in debate discussions, 
which is the focus of this work. 

1681



In a similar vein, several classification meth-
ods have been proposed to recognize opinion 
stances and speaker sides in online debates (So-
masundaran and Wiebe, 2009; Thomas et al., 
2006; Bansal et al., 2008; Burfoot et al., 2011; 
Yessenalina et al., 2010). Lin and Hauptmann 
(2006) also proposed a method to identify oppos-
ing perspectives. Abu-Jbara et al. (2012) identi-
fied subgroups. Kim and Hovy (2007) studied 
election prediction by analyzing online discus-
sions. Other related works studying dialogue and 
discourse in discussions include authority recog-
nition (Mayfield and Rosè, 2011), dialogue act 
segmentation and classification (Morbini and 
Sagae, 2011; Boyer et al., 2011), discourse struc-
ture prediction (Wang et al., 2011). 

All these prior works are valuable. But they 
are not designed to identify tolerance or to ana-
lyze tipping points of disagreements for intoler-
ance in discussions which are the focus of this 
work. 

3 Discussion/Debate Data 
For this research, we used discussion posts from 
Volconvo.com. This forum is divided into vari-
ous domains: Politics, Religion, Science, etc. 
Each domain consists of multiple discussion 
threads. Each thread consists of a list of posts. 
Our experimental data is from two domains, Pol-
itics and Religion. The data is summarized in 
Table 1(a). In this work, the terms users, authors 
and participants are used interchangeably. The 
full data is used for modeling, but 436 and 501 
authors from Politics and Religion domains were 
manually labeled as being tolerant or intolerant 
(Table 1(c)) respectively for classification exper-
iments.   

Two judges (graduate students) were used to 
label the data. The judges are fluent in English 
and were briefed on the definition of tolerance 
(see §1). From each domain (Politics, Religion), 
we randomly sampled authors having not more 
than 60 posts in order to reduce the labeling bur-
den as the judges need to read all posts and see 
all interactions of each author before providing a 
label. Given all posts by an author, 𝑎 and his/her 
associated interactions (posts by other authors 
replying or quoting 𝑎), the judges were asked to 
provide a label for author 𝑎 as being tolerant or 
intolerant. In our labeling, we found that users 
strongly exhibit one dominant trait: tolerant or 
intolerant, as our data consists of topics like elec-
tions, immigration, theism, terrorism, and vege-
tarianism across politics and religion domains, 

which are often heated and thus attract people 
with pre-determined, strong, and polarized 
stances1.  

The judges worked in isolation (to prevent bi-
as) during annotation/labeling and were also 
asked to provide a short reason for their judg-
ment. The agreement statistics using Cohen’s 
kappa are given in Table 1(b), which shows sub-
stantial agreements according to the scale 2  in 
(Landis and Koch, 1977). This shows that toler-
ance as defined in §1 is quite decisive and one 
can decide whether a debater is exhibiting toler-
ant vs. intolerant quite well. To account for disa-
greements in labels, the judges discussed their 
reasons to reach a consensus. The final labeled 
data is reported in Table 1(c). 

4 Model 
We now present our generative model to capture 
the key aspects of discussions/debates and their 
intricate relationships, which enable us to (1) 
design sophisticated features for classification 
and (2) perform an in-depth analysis of the inter-
play of disagreement and tolerance. The model is 
called Debate Topic Model (DTM).  

DTM is a semi-supervised generative model 
motivated by the joint occurrence of various top-
ics; and agreement and disagreement expressions 
(abbreviated AD-expressions hereon) in debate 
posts. A typical debate post mentions a few top-
ics (using similar topical terms) and expresses 
some viewpoints with one or more AD-
expression types (Agreement and Disagreement) 
using semantically related expressions. This ob-
servation forms the basis of the generative pro-
cess of our model where documents (posts) are 
represented as admixtures of latent topics and 
AD-expression types (Agreement and Disagree-
ment). This key observation and the motivation 
of modeling debates are from our previous work 
in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a). In the new set-
                                                           
1  These hardened perspectives are theoretically supported 
by the polarization effect (Sunstein, 2002), and the hostile 
media effect, a scenario where partisans rigidly hold on to 
their stances (Hansen and Hyunjung, 2011). 
2  Agreement levels are as follows. 𝜅 ∈ [0, 0.2]: Poor, 
𝜅 ∈ (0.2, 0.4]:Fair, 𝜅 ∈ (0.4, 0.6]: Moderate, 𝜅 ∈ (0.6, 0.8]: 
Substantial, and 𝜅 ∈ (0.8, 1.0]: Almost perfect agreement.

ting, we model topics and debate expression dis-
tributions specific to authors as this work is con-
cerned with modeling authors’ (in)tolerance na-
ture. Making latent variable 𝜃𝐸 and 𝜃𝑇 author 
specific facilitates modeling user behaviors 
(§5.3). 

Assume we have 𝑡1…𝑇  topics and 𝑒1…𝐸  expres-
sion types in our corpus. In our case of debate 
posts, based upon reading various posts, we hy-
pothesize that 𝐸 = 2 as in debates as we mostly 
find 2 dominant expression types: Agreement 
and Disagreement. Meanings of variables used in 
the following discussion are detailed in Table 2. 

In this work, a document/post is viewed as a bag 
of n-grams and we use terms to denote both 
words (unigrams) and phrases (n-grams)3. DTM 
is a switching graphical model performing a 
switch between topics and AD-expressions simi-
lar to that in (Zhao et al., 2010). The switch is 
done using a learned maximum entropy (Max-
Ent) model. The rationale here is that topical and 
AD-expression terms usually play different syn-
tactic roles in a sentence. Topical terms (e.g., 
“U.S. elections,” “government,” “income tax”) 
tend to be noun and noun phrases while expres-
sion terms (“I refute,” “how can you say,” “I’d 
agree”) usually contain pronouns, verbs, wh-
determiners, and modals. In order to utilize the 
part-of-speech (POS) tag information, we place 
the topic/AD-expression distribution, 𝜓𝑎,𝑑,𝑗  (the 
prior over the indicator variable 𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗) in the term 
plate (Figure 1)  and set it using a Max-Ent mod-
el conditioned on the observed context 𝑥𝑎,𝑑,𝑗  as-
sociated with 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗  and the learned Max-Ent 
parameters 𝜆 (details in §4.1). In this work, we 
use both lexical and POS features of the previ-
ous, current and next POS tags/lexemes of the 
term 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗  as the contextual information, 
i.e., 𝑥𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 = [𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗−1 , 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 , 𝑃𝑂𝑆𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗+1 ,
𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗−1,𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 , 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗+1], which is used to produce 
feature functions for Max-Ent. For phrasal terms 
(n-grams), all POS tags and lexemes of 𝑤𝑑,𝑗  are 
considered as contextual information for compu-
ting feature functions in Max-Ent. DTM has the 
following generative process: 

A. For each AD-expression type 𝑒, draw 𝜑𝑒𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛽𝐸) 
B. For each topic t, draw 𝜑𝑡𝑇~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛽𝑇) 
C. For each author 𝑎 ∈ {1 …𝐴}: 

i. Draw 𝜃𝑎𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛼𝐸) 
ii. Draw 𝜃𝑎𝑇~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛼𝑇) 
iii. For each document/post 𝑑 ∈ {1 …𝐷𝑎}: 

I. For each term 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗, 𝑗 ∈ {1 …𝑁𝑎,𝑑}: 
a. Set 𝜓𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 ← 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐸𝑛𝑡(𝑥𝑎,𝑑,𝑗; 𝜆) 
b. Draw 𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗~𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑖(𝜓𝑎,𝑑,𝑗) 
c. if (𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 =  �̂�) // 𝑤𝑑,𝑗is an AD-expression term 

Draw 𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃𝑎𝐸) 
else // 𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 =  �̂�, 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗is a topical term 

Draw 𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗~ 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜃𝑎𝑇) 
d. Emit 𝑤𝑎,𝑑,𝑗~𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡(𝜑𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗

𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗) 

4.1 Inference 
We employ posterior inference using Monte Car-
                                                           
3 Topics in most topic models (e.g., LDA (Blei et al., 2003)) 
are unigram distributions and a document is treated as an 
exchangeable bag-of-words. This offers a computational 
advantage over models considering word orders (Wallach, 
2006). As our goal is to enhance the expressiveness of 
DTM (rather than “modeling” word order), we use 1-4 
grams preserving the advantages of exchangeable modeling.

where 𝑘 = (𝑎,𝑑, 𝑗) denotes the 𝑗𝑡ℎ  term of docu-
ment 𝑑 by author 𝑎 and the subscript ¬𝑘 denotes 
assignments excluding the term at (𝑎,𝑑, 𝑗). Omis-
sion of the latter index denoted by (·) represents 
the marginalized sum over the latter index. 
Count variables are detailed in Table 1 (last two 
rows). 𝜆1…𝑛  are the parameters of the learned 
Max-Ent model corresponding to the 𝑛  binary 
feature functions 𝑓1…𝑛 for Max-Ent. The learned 
Max-Ent 𝜆  parameters in conjunction with the 
observed context, 𝑥𝑎,𝑑,𝑗 feed the supervision sig-
nal for updating the topic/expression switch pa-
rameter, 𝑟 in equations (1) and (2).  

The hyper-parameters for the model were set 
to the values 𝛽𝑇= 𝛽𝐸= 0.1 and 𝛼𝑇  = 50/𝑇, 𝛼𝐸  = 
50/ 𝐸 , suggested in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 
2004). Model parameters were estimated after 
5000 Gibbs iterations with a burn-in of 1000 it-
erations. The Max-Ent parameters 𝜆  were 
learned using 500 labeled terms in each domain 
(politics:- topical: 376 and AD-expression: 124; 
religion:- topical: 349 and AD-expression: 151) 
appearing at least 10 times in debate threads oth-
er than the data in Table 1 (we do so since the 

data in Table 1(c) is later used in the classifica-
tion experiments in §6.1). 

Table 3 lists some top AD-expressions discov-
ered by DTM. We see that DTM can cluster 
many correct AD-expressions, e.g., “I disagree”, 
“I refute”, “don’t accept”, etc. in disagreement; 
and “I agree”, “you’re correct”, “agree with 
you”, etc. in agreement. Further, it also discovers 
highly specific and more distinctive expressions 
beyond those used in Max-Ent training (marked 
blue in italics), e.g., “I don’t buy your”, “can you 
prove,” “you fail to”, and “you have no clue” in 
disagreement; and phrases like “valid point”, 
“rightly said”, “I do support”, and “very well 
put” in agreement. In §6.1, we will see that these 
AD-expressions serve as high quality features 
for predicting tolerance. 

Lastly, we note that DTM also estimates sev-
eral pieces of useful information (e.g., AD-
expressions, posterior estimates of author’s argu-
ing nature, 𝜃𝑎𝐸 ; latent topics and expressions, 
𝜑𝑡𝑇;  𝜑𝑒𝐸 , etc.). These will be used to produce a 
rich set of user behavioral features for character-
izing tolerance in §5.3. 

5 Feature Engineering 
We now propose features which will be used for 
model building to classify tolerant and intolerant 
authors in Table 1(c). We use three sets of fea-
tures. 

5.1 Language based Features of Tolerance 
Word and POS n-grams: As tolerance in com-
munication is directly reflected in language us-
age, word n-grams are obvious features. We also 
use POS tags (obtained using Stanford Tagger4) 
as features. The rationale of using POS tag based 
features is that intolerant communications are 
often characterized by hate/egotistic speech 
which have pronounced use of specific part of 
speech (e.g., pronouns) (Zingo, 1998). 

Heuristic Factor Analysis: In psycholinguistics, 
factor analysis refers to the process of finding 
groups of semantically similar linguistic con-
structs (words/phrases). It is also called meaning 
extraction in (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007). As 
tolerance in discussions is characterized by rea-
soned expressions which often accompany 
sourcing (e.g., providing a hyperlink, making an 
attempt to clarify with some evidence, etc.), we 
compiled a list of reasoned and sourced expres-
sions (shown in Table 4) from prior works

Disagreement expressions (𝜑𝑒=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐸  ) 
I, disagree, I don’t, I disagree, argument, reject, claim, I reject, 
I refute, and, your, I refuse, won’t, the claim, nonsense, I con-
test, dispute, I think, completely disagree, don’t accept, don’t

doubt, your nonsense, true, can you prove, argument fails, you

5.2 Debate Expression Features 
AD-expressions: As we have seen in §4, DTM 
can discover specific agreement and disagree-
ment expressions in debates. We use these ex-
pressions as another feature set. Estimated AD-
expressions (Table 3) serve as a principled way 
of performing factor analysis in debates instead 
of heuristic factor analysis as in Table 4 used in 
prior works.  

As the AD-expression types are modeled as 
Dirichlet distributions (𝜑𝐸~𝐷𝑖𝑟(𝛽𝐸)), due to the 
smoothing effect, each term in the vocabulary 
has some non-zero probability mass associated 
with the expression types. To ensure that the dis-
covered expressions are representative AD-
expressions, we only consider the terms in 𝜑𝐸 
with 𝑝(𝑣|𝑒) = 𝜑𝑒,𝑣𝐸 > 0.001  as probability 
masses lower than 0.001 are more due to the 
smoothing effect of Dirichlet distribution than 
true correlation. 

5.3 User Behavioral Features 
Here we propose several features of user interac-
tion which reflect the socio-psychological state 
of tolerance while participating in discussions. 
We note that these features rely on the posterior 
estimates of latent variables 𝜃𝐸, 𝑧, and 𝑟 in DTM 
(§4) and are thus difficult to obtain without 
modeling. 

Overall Arguing Nature: The posterior on 𝜃𝑎𝐸 
(Table 2) for each author, 𝑎 gives an estimate of 
𝑎’s overall arguing nature (agreeing or disagree-
ing). We use the probability mass assigned to 
each arguing nature type as a user behavioral 
feature. This gives us two features 𝑓1, 𝑓2 as fol-

lows: 
𝑓1(𝑎) =  𝜃𝑎,𝐴𝑔𝐸  ;   𝑓2(𝑎) =  𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸      (3) 

Behavioral Response: As intolerant users are 
likely to attract more disagreement, it is naturally 
useful to estimate the response (agreeing vs. dis-
agreeing) a user receives from other users. For 
computing behavioral response, we first use the 
posterior on 𝑧 to compute the distribution of AD-
expressions (i.e., the relative probability masses 
of agreeing and disagreeing expressions) in a 
document 𝑑 by an author 𝑎 as follows: 

𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐴𝑔𝐸 =
��𝑗�𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=𝐴𝑔,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��

��𝑗�𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=�̂�,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��
; 

𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 =
��𝑗�𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��

��𝑗�𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=�̂�,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��
     (4) 

Now to get the overall behavioral response of an 
author, 𝑎  we take the expected value of the 
agreeing and disagreeing responses that 𝑎  re-
ceived from other authors 𝑎′  who replied to or 
quoted 𝑎 ’s posts. The expectations below are 
taken over all posts 𝑑′  by 𝑎′  which reply/quote 
posts of 𝑎. 

𝑓3(𝑎) =  𝐸[𝜃𝑎′ 𝑑′,𝐴𝑔
𝐸 ]; 𝑓4(𝑎) =  𝐸�𝜃𝑎′ 𝑑′,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔

𝐸 �  (5) 

Equality of Speech: In communication literature 
(Dahlgren, 2005; Habermas, 1984), equality is 
theorized as an essential element of tolerance. 
Each participant must be able to participate on an 
equal footing with others without anybody domi-
nating the discussion. In online debates, we can 
measure this phenomenon using the following 
feature: 

𝑓5(𝑎) = 𝐸 ��
# 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑏𝑦 𝑎 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝑙

# 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝑙
� 𝐸[𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 ]�  (6) 

where the inner expectation is taken over all 
posts of 𝑎 in thread 𝑙 and the outer expectation is 
taken over all threads 𝑙  in which 𝑎  participated. 
The above definition computes the aggressive 
posting behavior of author 𝑎 whereby he tires to 
dominate the thread by posting more than others. 
The aggressive posting behavior is weighted by 
author’s disagreeing nature because a person 
usually exhibits a dominating nature when he 
pushes hard to establish his ideology (which is 
often in disagreement with others) (Moxey and 
Sanford, 2000).  

Topic Shifts: An interesting phenomenon of hu-
man (social) psyche is that when people are una-
ble to logically argue their stances and feel they 
are losing the debate, they often try to belit-
tle/deride others by pulling unrelated topics into 
discussion (Slavin and Kriegman, 1992). This is

referred to as topic shifts. Topic shifts thus have a 
relation with tolerance in deliberation. Stromer-
Galley (2005) reported that if the discussion is 
off topic, then tolerance or deliberation cannot 
meet its objective of deep consideration of an 
issue. Hence, the average topic shifts of an au-
thor, 𝑎 across various posts in a thread can serve 
as a good feature for measuring tolerance. We 
use the posterior on per-document topic distribu-
tion, 𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝑡𝑇 =

��𝑗�𝑧𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=𝑡,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��
��𝑗�𝑟𝑎,𝑑,𝑗=�̂�,1≤𝑗≤𝑁𝑎,𝑑��

 to measure topic 
shifts using KL-Divergence as follows: 

𝑓6 = 𝐸 �avg𝑑,𝑑′∈ 𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝑙 �𝐷𝐾𝐿�𝜃𝑎,𝑑𝑇 ||𝜃𝑎,𝑑′
𝑇 ���     (7) 

We first compute author, 𝑎’s average topic shifts 
in a thread, 𝑙 which measures his topic shifts in 𝑙. 
But this only gives us his behavior in one thread. 
To capture his overall behavior, we take the ex-
pected value of this behavior over all threads in 
which 𝑎  participated. We take average KL-
divergence (KL-Div.) over all pairs of posts by 𝑎 
in a given thread to account for the asymmetry of 
KL-Div. 

Finally, we note that by no means do we claim 
that the mere presence and a large value of any of 
the above features imply that a user is intolerant 
or tolerant. They are indicators of the phenome-
non of tolerance in discussions/debates. The ac-
tual prediction is done using the learned models 
in §6.1. 
6 Experimental Evaluation 
We now detail the experiments that investigate 
the strengths of features in §5. In particular, we 
first consider the task of classifying whether an 
author is tolerant or intolerant in discussions. 
Then, we analyze how disagreement affects tol-
erance. 

6.1 Tolerant and Intolerant Classification 
Here, we show that the features in §5 can help 
build accurate models for predicting tolerance. 
We employ a linear kernel 5  SVM (using the 
SVMLight system (Joachims, 1999)) and report 5-
fold cross validation (CV) results on the task of 
predicting the socio-psychological nature of us-
ers’ communication: tolerant vs. intolerant in 
politics and religion domains (Table 1(c)). Note 
that for each fold of 5-fold CV, DTM was run on 
the full data of each domain (Table 1(a)) exclud-
ing the users (and their associated posts) in the 
test set of that fold for generating the features of 
the training instances (users). The learned DTM 
                                                           
5 Other kernels (rbf, poly, sigmoid) did not perform as well. 

was then fitted (using the approach in (Hofmann, 
1999)) to the test set users and their posts for 
generating the features of the test instances.  

To investigate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed framework, we incrementally add feature 
sets starting with the baseline features.  Word 
unigrams and bigrams (inclusive of unigrams)6  
serve as our first baseline (B1a, B1b). Word + 
POS bigrams is our second baseline (B2). 
“Word” in B2 uses bigrams as B1b gives better 
results. B2 + Heuristic Factor Analysis (HFA) 
(Table 4) serve as our third baseline (B3). Table 
5 shows the experiment results. We note the fol-
lowing: 
1. Across both domains, adding POS bigrams 

slightly improves classification accuracy and 
F1-score beyond standard word unigrams and 
bigrams. Feature selection using information 
gain (IG) does not help much. 

2. Using heuristic factor analyses (HFA) of rea-
soned and sourced expressions (Table 4) 
brings about 1% and 2% improvement in ac-
curacy in politics and religion domains re-
spectively. 

3. Debate expression features (DE) in §5.2 and 
user behavioral features (UB) in §5.3 pro-
duced from DTM progressively improve clas-
sification accuracies by 4% and 8% in politics 
domains and 5% and 6% in religion domains. 
The improvements are also statistically signif-
icant.  

In summary, we can see that modeling made a 
major impact. It improved the accuracy by about 
10% than traditional unigram and bigram base-
lines. This shows that the debate expressions and 
user behaviors computed using the DTM model 
can capture various dimensions of (in)tolerance 
not captured by n-grams. 

6.2 How Disagreement affects Tolerance? 
We now quantitatively study the effect of disa-
greement on tolerance. We recall from §1 that 
tolerance indicates constructive discussion and 
allows disagreement. Some level of disagree-
ment is often times an integral component of 
deliberation and tolerance (Cappella et al., 
2002). 

Disagreements, however, can be either con-
structive or destructive. The distinction is that 
the former is aimed at arriving at a consensus or 
solution, while the latter leads to polarization 
and intolerance (Sunstein, 2002). It was also 
shown in (Dahlgren, 2005) that sustained disa-
                                                           
6 Higher order n-grams did not result in better results. 

1686



greement often takes a transition towards de-
structive disagreement and is likely to lead to 
intolerance. Similar phenomena was also identi-
fied in psychology literature (Critchley, 1964). 
In such cases, the participants often stubbornly 
stick to an extreme attitude, which eventually 
results in intolerance and defeats the very pur-
pose of deliberative discussion.  

An intriguing research question is: What is the 
relationship between disagreement and intoler-
ance? The question is interesting from both the 
communication and psycholinguistic perspec-
tives. The best of our knowledge, this is the first 
attempt towards seeking an answer. We work in 
the context of five issues/threads in real-life 
online debates. To derive quantitative and defi-
nite conclusions, it is required to perform the 
following tasks: 
• For each issue, empirically investigate in ex-

pectation the tipping point of disagreement 
beyond which a user tends to be intolerant. 

• Further, investigate the confidence on the es-
timated tipping point (i.e., what is the likeli-
hood that the estimated tipping point is statis-
tically significant instead of chance alone). 

We formalize the above tasks in the Bayesian 
setting. Recall from Table 2 of §4, that 𝜃𝑎,𝐴𝑔𝐸  (re-
spectively, 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 ) are the estimates of agreeing 
and disagreeing nature of an author and 𝜃𝑎,𝐴𝑔𝐸  + 
𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸  = 1. Let 𝑇𝑃(𝜏) denote the event that in 

expectation a threshold value of 0 < 𝜏 < 1 
serves as a tipping point of disagreement beyond 
which intolerance is exhibited. Note that we em-
phasize the term “in expectation” (taken over all 
authors). We do not mean that every author 
whose disagreement, 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 >  𝜏 , is intolerant. 
The empirical likelihood of 𝑇𝑃(𝜏)  can be ex-
pressed by the following probability expression: 
ℒ�𝑇𝑃(𝜏)� = 

𝐸�𝑃�𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 > 𝜏|𝑎 = 𝐼� − 𝑃�𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 > 𝜏|𝑎 = 𝑇�� (8) 

The events 𝑎 = 𝐼 and 𝑎 = 𝑇 denote that author 
𝑎 is intolerant and tolerant respectively. The ex-
pectation is taken over authors. Showing that 𝜏 
indeed serves as the tipping point of disagree-
ment to exhibit intolerance corresponds is to re-
jecting the null hypothesis that the probabilities 
in (8) are equal. We employ a Fisher’s exact test 
to test significance and report confidence 
measures (using p-values) for the tipping point 
thresholds. The results are shown in Table 6. 

The threshold 𝜏 is computed using the entropy 
method in (Fayyad and Irani, 1993) as follows: 
We first fit our previously learned model (using 
the data in Table 1 (a)) to the new threads in Ta-
ble 6 and its users and posts to obtain the esti-
mates of 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸  and other latent variables for 
feature generation. The learned classifier in §6.1 
is used to predict the nature of users (tolerant vs.

intolerant) in the new threads7. Then, for each 
user we have his predicted deliberative (social) 
psyche (Tolerant vs. Intolerant) and also his 
overall disagreeing nature exhibited in that 
thread (the posterior on 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 ∈ [0, 1]). For a 
thread, tolerant and intolerant users (data points) 
span the range [0, 1] attaining different values 
for 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 . Each candidate tipping point of disa-
greement, 0 ≤ 𝜏′ ≤ 1 results in a binary partition 
of the range with each partition containing some 
proportion of tolerant and intolerant users. We 
compute the entropy of the partition for every 
candidate tipping point in the range [0, 1]. The 
final tipping point threshold, 𝜏  is chosen such 
that it minimizes the partition entropy based on 
the binary cut-point method in (Fayyad and 
Irani, 1993).  

Since we perform a thread level analysis, the 
results in Table 6 are thread/issue specific. We 
note the following from Table 6: 
1. Across all threads/issues, we find that the ex-

pected disagreement over all posts, 𝑑, 
𝐸�𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 � > 0.5 showing that in discussions 
of the reported issues, disagreement predomi-
nates. 

2. 𝐸�𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 � also gives an estimate of overall 
heat in the issue being discussed. We find 
sensitive issues like abortion and socialism 
being more heated than healthcare, Obama, 
etc. 

3. The percentage of intolerant users increases 
with the expected overall disagreement in the 
issue except for the issue Obama euphoria. 

4. The estimated tipping point of disagreement 
to exhibit intolerance, 𝜏  happens to vary in-
versely with the expected disagreement, 
𝐸�𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 � except the issue Obama euphoria. 
This reflects that as overall disagreement in 
the issue increases, the tipping point of intol-
erance decreases, i.e., due to high discussion 
heat, people are likely to turn intolerant even 
with relatively small amount of disagreement. 
This finding dovetails with prior studies in 
psychology (Rokeach and Fruchter, 1956) that 
heated discussions are likely to reduce thresh-

                                                           
7 Although this prediction may not be perfect, it can be 
regarded as considerably reliable to study the trend of toler-
ance across different issues as our classifier (in §6.1) attains 
a high (83%) classification accuracy using the full feature 
set. As judging all users across all threads would require 
reading about 7000 posts, for confirmation, we randomly 
sampled 30 authors across various threads for labeling by 
our judges. 28 out of 30 predictions produced by the classi-
fier correlated with the judges' labels, which should be suf-
ficiently accurate for our analysis. 

olds of reception leading to dogmatism, ego-
tism, and intolerance. Table 6 shows that for 
moderately heated issues (healthcare, Eu-
rope’s collapse), in expectation, author’s dis-
agreement 𝜃𝑎,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸  should exceed 61-65% to 
exhibit intolerance. However, for sensitive is-
sues, we find that the tipping point is much 
lower, abortion: 37%; socialism: 48%. 

5. The issue Obama Euphoria is an exception to 
other issues’ trends. Even though in expecta-
tion, it has 𝐸�𝜃𝑎,𝑑,𝐷𝑖𝑠𝐴𝑔𝐸 �  = 66% overall disa-
greement, the percentage of intolerant users 
remains the lowest (30%) and the tipping 
point attains a highest value (𝜏 = 0.71), show-
ing more tolerance on the issue. A plausible 
reason could be that Obama is somewhat more 
liked and hence attracts less intolerance from 
users8. 

6. The p-values of the estimated tipping points, 𝜏 
across all issues are statistically significant at 
98-99% confidence levels. 

7 Conclusion 
This work performed a deep analysis of the soci-
opsychological and psycholinguistic phenome-
non of tolerance in online discussions, which is 
an important concept in the field of communica-
tions. A novel framework is proposed, which is 
capable of characterizing and classifying toler-
ance in online discussions. Further, a novel tech-
nique was also proposed to quantitatively evalu-
ate the interplay of tolerance and disagreement. 
Our empirical results using real-life online dis-
cussions render key insights into the psycholin-
guistic process of tolerance and dovetail with 
existing theories in psychology and communica-
tions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first such quantitative study. In our future work, 
we want to further this research and study the 
role of diversity of opinions in the context of 
tolerance and its relation to polarization.
