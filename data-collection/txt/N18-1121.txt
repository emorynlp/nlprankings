Abstract

Homographs, words with different meanings
but the same surface form, have long caused
difficulty for machine translation systems, as
it is difficult to select the correct translation
based on the context. However, with the ad-
vent of neural machine translation (NMT) sys-
tems, which can theoretically take into ac-
count global sentential context, one may hy-
pothesize that this problem has been allevi-
ated. In this paper, we first provide empir-
ical evidence that existing NMT systems in
fact still have significant problems in properly
translating ambiguous words. We then pro-
ceed to describe methods, inspired by the word
sense disambiguation literature, that model the
context of the input word with context-aware
word embeddings that help to differentiate
the word sense before feeding it into the en-
coder. Experiments on three language pairs
demonstrate that such models improve the per-
formance of NMT systems both in terms of
BLEU score and in the accuracy of translating
homographs.1

1 Introduction

Neural machine translation (NMT; Sutskever et al.
(2014); Bahdanau et al. (2015), §2), a method
for MT that performs translation in an end-to-
end fashion using neural networks, is quickly be-
coming the de-facto standard in MT applications
due to its impressive empirical results. One of
the drivers behind these results is the ability of
NMT to capture long-distance context using re-
current neural networks in both the encoder, which
takes the input and turns it into a continuous-space
representation, and the decoder, which tracks the

target-sentence state, deciding which word to out-
put next. As a result of this ability to capture
long-distance dependencies, NMT has achieved
great improvements in a number of areas that
have bedeviled traditional methods such as phrase-
based MT (PBMT; Koehn et al. (2003)), including
agreement and long-distance syntactic dependen-
cies (Neubig et al., 2015; Bentivogli et al., 2016).

One other phenomenon that was poorly handled
by PBMT was homographs – words that have the
same surface form but multiple senses. As a result,
PBMT systems required specific separate mod-
ules to incorporate long-term context, performing
word-sense (Carpuat and Wu, 2007b; Pu et al.,
2017) or phrase-sense (Carpuat and Wu, 2007a)
disambiguation to improve their handling of these
phenomena. Thus, we may wonder: do NMT sys-
tems suffer from the same problems when trans-
lating homographs? Or are the recurrent nets ap-
plied in the encoding step, and the strong language
model in the decoding step enough to alleviate all
problems of word sense ambiguity?

In §3 we first attempt to answer this question
quantitatively by examining the word translation

accuracy of a baseline NMT system as a func-
tion of the number of senses that each word has.
Results demonstrate that standard NMT systems
make a significant number of errors on homo-
graphs, a few of which are shown in Fig. 1.

With this result in hand, we propose a method
for more directly capturing contextual information
that may help disambiguate difficult-to-translate
homographs. Specifically, we learn from neu-
ral models for word sense disambiguation (Kalch-
brenner et al., 2014; Iyyer et al., 2015; Kågebäck
and Salomonsson, 2016; Yuan et al., 2016; Šuster
et al., 2016), examining three methods inspired by
this literature (§4). In order to incorporate this in-
formation into NMT, we examine two methods:
gating the word-embeddings in the model (simi-
larly to Choi et al. (2017)), and concatenating the
context-aware representation to the word embed-
ding (§5).

To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we
compare our context-aware models with a strong
baseline (Luong et al., 2015) on the English-
German, English-French, and English-Chinese
WMT dataset. We show that our proposed model
outperforms the baseline in the overall BLEU
score across three different language pairs. Quan-
titative analysis demonstrates that our model per-
forms better on translating homographs. Lastly,
we show sample translations of the baseline sys-
tem and our proposed model.

2 Neural Machine Translation

We follow the global-general-attention NMT ar-
chitecture with input-feeding proposed by Lu-
ong et al. (2015), which we will briefly sum-
marize here. The neural network models the
conditional distribution over translations Y =
(y1, y2, . . . , ym) given a sentence in source lan-
guage X = (x1, x2, . . . xn) as P (Y |X). A NMT
system consists of an encoder that summarizes
the source sentence X as a vector representation
h, and a decoder that generates a target word at
each time step conditioned on both h and previous
words. The conditional distribution is optimized
with cross-entropy loss at each decoder output.

The encoder is usually a uni-directional or bi-
directional RNN that reads the input sentence
word by word. In the more standard bi-directional
case, before being read by the RNN unit, each
word in X is mapped to an embedding in continu-

ous vector space by a function fe.

fe(xt) = Me
> · 1(xt) (1)

Me ∈ R|Vs|×d is a matrix that maps a one-hot rep-
resentation of xt, 1(xt) to a d-dimensional vector
space, and Vs is the source vocabulary. We call the
word embedding computed this way Lookup em-
bedding. The word embeddings are then read by a
bi-directional RNN

−→
h t =

−−→
RNNe(

−→
h t−1, fe(xt)) (2)

←−
h t =

←−−
RNNe(

←−
h t+1, fe(xt)) (3)

After being read by both RNNs we can compute
the actual hidden state at step t, ht = [

−→
h t;
←−
h t],

and the encoder summarized representation h =
hn. The recurrent units

−−→
RNNe and

←−−
RNNe are usu-

ally either LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,
1997) or GRUs (Chung et al., 2014).

The decoder is a uni-directional RNN that de-
codes the tth target word conditioned on (1) previ-
ous decoder hidden state gt−1, (2) previous word
yt−1 , and (3) the weighted sum of encoder hidden
states at. The decoder maintains the tth hidden
state gt as follows,

gt =
−−→
RNNd(gt−1, fd(yt−1),at) (4)

Again,
−−→
RNNd is either LSTM or GRU, and fd is a

mapping function in target language space.
The general attention mechanism for comput-

ing the weighted encoder hidden states at first
computes the similarity between gt−1 and ht′ for
t′ = 1, 2, . . . , n.

score(gt−1,ht′) = gt−1W atth
>
t′ (5)

The similarities are then normalized through a
softmax layer , which results in the weights for
encoder hidden states.

αt,t′ =
exp(score(gt−1,ht′))∑n
k=1 exp(score(gt−1,hk))

(6)

We can then compute at as follows,

at =

n∑

k=1

αt,khk (7)

Finally, we compute the distribution over yt as,

ĝt = tanh(W 1[gt;at]) (8)

p(yt|y<t, X) = softmax(W 2ĝt) (9)

3 NMT’s Problems with Homographs

As described in Eqs. (2) and (3), NMT models en-
code the words using recurrent encoders, theoreti-
cally endowing them with the ability to handle ho-
mographs through global sentential context. How-
ever, despite the fact that they have this ability, our
qualitative observation of NMT results revealed
a significant number of ambiguous words being
translated incorrectly, casting doubt on whether
the standard NMT setup is able to appropriately
learn parameters that disambiguate these word
choices.

To demonstrate this more concretely, in Fig. 2
we show the translation accuracy of an NMT sys-
tem with respect to words of varying levels of
ambiguity. Specifically, we use the best baseline
NMT system to translate three different language
pairs from WMT test set (detailed in §6) and plot
the F1-score of word translations by the number of
senses that they have. The number of senses for a
word is acquired from the Cambridge English dic-
tionary,2 after excluding stop words.3

We evaluate the translation performance of
words in the source side by aligning them to
the target side using fast-align (Dyer et al.,
2013). The aligner outputs a set of target words
to which the source words aligns for both the ref-
erence translation and the model translations. F1
score is calculated between the two sets of words.

After acquiring the F1 score for each word, we
bucket the F1 scores by the number of senses, and
plot the average score of four consecutive buckets
as shown in Fig. 2. As we can see from the re-
sults, the F1 score for words decreases as the num-
ber of senses increases for three different language

pairs. This demonstrates that the translation per-
formance of current NMT systems on words with
more senses is significantly decreased from that
for words with fewer senses. From this result, it
is evident that modern NMT architectures are not
enough to resolve the problem of homographs on
their own. The result corresponds to the findings
in prior work (Rios et al., 2017).

4 Neural Word Sense Disambiguation

Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of
resolving the ambiguity of homographs (Ng and
Lee, 1996; Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004; Zhong
and Ng, 2010; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013; Chen
et al., 2014; Camacho-Collados et al., 2015), and
we hypothesize that by learning from these mod-
els we can improve the ability of the NMT model
to choose the correct translation for these ambigu-
ous words. Recent research tackles this problem
with neural models and has shown state-of-the art
results on WSD datasets (Kågebäck and Salomon-
sson, 2016; Yuan et al., 2016). In this section, we
will summarize three methods for WSD which we
will further utilize as three different context net-
works to improve NMT.

Neural bag-of-words (NBOW) Kalchbrenner
et al. (2014); Iyyer et al. (2015) have shown suc-
cess by representing full sentences with a context
vector, which is the average of the Lookup embed-
dings of the input sequence

ct =
1

n

n∑

k=1

M>c 1(xk) (10)

This is a simple way to model sentences, but has
the potential to capture the global topic of the sen-
tence in a straightforward and coherent way. How-
ever, in this case, the context vector would be the
same for every word in the input sequence.

Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) Kågebäck
and Salomonsson (2016) leveraged a bi-
directional LSTM that learns a context vector for
the target word in the input sequence and predicts
the word sense with a multi-layer perceptron.
Specifically, we can compute the context vector ct
for tth word similarly to bi-directional encoder as
follows,

−→c t =
−−→
RNNc(−→c t−1, fc(xt)) (11)

←−c t =
←−−
RNNc(←−c t+1, fc(xt)) (12)

1338



ct = [
−→c t;←−c t] (13)

−−→
RNNc,

←−−
RNNc are forward and backward

LSTMs repectively, and fc(xt) = M>c 1(xt) is a
function that maps a word to continous embedding
space.

Held-out LSTM (HoLSTM) Yuan et al. (2016)
trained a LSTM language model, which predicts
a held-out word given the surrounding context,
with a large amount of unlabeled text as training
data. Given the context vector from this language
model, they predict the word sense with a WSD
classifier. Specifically, we can compute the con-
text vector ct for tth word by first replacing tth
word with a special symbol (e.g. <$>). We then
feed the replaced sequence to a uni-directional
LSTM:

c̃i =
−−→
RNNc(c̃i−1, fc(xi)) (14)

Finally, we can get context vector for the tth word

ct = c̃n (15)

−−→
RNNc and fc are defined in BiLSTM paragraph,
and n is the length of the sequence. Despite the
fact that the context vector is always the last hid-
den state of the LSTM no matter which word we
are targeting, the input sequence read by the HoL-
STM is actually different every time.

5 Adding Context to NMT

Now that we have several methods to incorporate
global context regarding a single word, it is neces-
sary to incorporate this context with NMT. Specif-
ically, we propose two methods to either Gate or
Concatenate a context vector ct with the Lookup
embedding M>e · 1(xt) to form a context-aware
word embedding before feeding it into the encoder
as shown in Fig. 3. The detail of these methods is
described below.

Gate Inspired by Choi et al. (2017), as our first
method for integration of context-aware word em-
beddings, we use a gating function as follows:

f ′e(xt) = fe(xt)� σ(ct) (16)
= M>e 1(xt)� σ(ct) (17)

The symbol � represents element-wise multipli-
cation, and σ is element-wise sigmoid function.

Figure 3: Illustration of our proposed model. The con-
text network is a differentiable network that computes
context vector ct for word xt taking the whole sequence
as input. ⊗ represents the operation that combines orig-
inal word embedding xt with corresponding context
vector ct to form context-aware word embeddings.

Choi et al. (2017) use this method in concert with
averaged embeddings from words in source lan-
guage like the NBOW model above, which nat-
urally uses the same context vectors for all time
steps. In this paper, we additionally test this func-
tion with context vectors calculated using the BiL-
STM and HoLSTM .

Concatenate We also propose another way for
incorporating context: by concatenating the con-
text vector with the word embeddings. This is ex-
pressed as below:

f ′e(xt) = W 3[fe(xt); ct] (18)

= W 3[M
>
e 1(xt); ct] (19)

W 3 is used to project the concatenated vector
back to the original d-dimensional space.

For each method can compute context vector ct
with either the NBOW, BiLSTM, or HoLSTM de-
scribed in §4. We share the parameters in fe with
fc (i.e. M e = M c) since the vocabulary space is
the same for context network and encoder. As a
result, our context network only slightly increases
the number of model parameters. Details about the
number of parameters of each model we use in the
experiments are shown in Table 1.

French, we use a combination of Europarl v7,
Common Crawl, and News Commentary as train-

For Chinese, we use a combination of News Com-

dev2017 (2002 sentences) for Chinese.4 Details
about tokenization are as follows. For German, we
use the tokenized dataset from Luong et al. (2015);
for French, we used the moses (Koehn et al., 2007)
tokenization script with the “-a” flag; for Chinese,
we split sequences of Chinese characters, but keep
sequences of non-Chinese characters as they are,
using the script from IWSLT Evaluation 2015.5

We compare our context-aware NMT systems
with strong baseline models on each dataset.

official test set hasn’t been released.

6.1 Training Details

We limit our vocabularies to be the top 50K most
frequent words for both source and target lan-
guage. Words not in these shortlisted vocabularies
are converted into an 〈unk〉 token.

When training our NMT systems, following
Bahdanau et al. (2015), we filter out sentence pairs
whose lengths exceed 50 words and shuffle mini-
batches as we proceed. We train our model with
the following settings using SGD as our optimiza-
tion method. (1) We start with a learning rate of
1 and we begin to halve the learning rate every

1340



epoch once it overfits. 6 (2) We train until the
model converges. (i.e. the difference between the
perplexity for the current epoch and the previous
epoch is less than 0.01) (3) We batched the in-
stances with the same length and our maximum
mini-batch size is 256, and (4) the normalized gra-
dient is rescaled whenever its norm exceeds 5. (6)
Dropout is applied between vertical RNN stacks
with probability 0.3. Additionally, the context net-
work is trained jointly with the encoder-decoder
architecture. Our model is built upon OpenNMT
(Klein et al., 2017) with the default settings unless
otherwise noted.

6.2 Experimental Results

In this section, we compare our proposed context-
aware NMT models with baseline models on
English-German dataset. Our baseline models are
encoder-decoder models using global-general at-
tention and input feeding on the decoder side as
described in §2, varying the settings on the en-
coder side. Our proposed model builds upon base-
line models by concatenating or gating different
types of context vectors. We use LSTM for en-
coder, decoder, and context network. The decoder
is the same across baseline models and proposed
models, having 500 hidden units. During testing,
we use beam search with a beam size of 5. The
dimension for input word embedding d is set to
500 across encoder, decoder, and context network.
Settings for three different baselines are listed be-
low.

Baseline 1: An uni-directional LSTM with 500
hidden units and 2 layers of stacking LSTM.

Baseline 2: A bi-directional LSTM with 250 hid-
den units and 2 layers of stacking LSTM.
Each state is summarized by concatenating
the hidden states of forward and backward
encoder into 500 hidden units.

Baseline 3: A bi-directional LSTM with 250 hid-
den units and 3 layers of stacking LSTM.
This can be compared with the proposed
method, which adds an extra layer of com-
putation before the word embeddings, essen-
tially adding an extra layer.

The context network uses the below settings.

6We define overfitting to be when perplexity on the dev
set of the current epoch is worse than the previous epoch.

NBOW: Average word embedding of the input
sequence.

BiLSTM: A single-layer bi-directional LSTM
with 250 hidden units. The context vector
is represented by concatenating the hidden
states of forward and backward LSTM into
a 500 dimensional vector.

HoLSTM: A single-layer uni-directional LSTM
with 500 hidden units.

The results are shown in Table 1. The first
thing we observe is that the best context-aware
model (results in bold in the table) achieved im-
provements of around 0.7 BLEU on both WMT14
and WMT15 over the respective baseline methods
with 2 layers. This is in contrast to simply using
a 3-layer network, which actually degrades per-
formance, perhaps due to the vanishing gradients
problem it increases the difficulty in learning.

Next, comparing different methods for incor-
porating context, we can see that BiLSTM per-
forms best across all settings. HoLSTM performs
slightly better than NBOW, and NBOW obviously
suffers from having the same context vector for ev-
ery word in the input sequence failing to outper-
form the corresponding baselines. Comparing the
two integration methods that incorporate context
into word embeddings. Both methods improve
over the baseline with BiLSTM as the context net-
work. Concatenating the context vector and the
word embedding performed better than gating. Fi-
nally, in contrast to the baseline, it is not obvious
whether using uni-directional or bi-directional as
the encoder is better for our proposed models, par-
ticularly when BiLSTM is used for calculating the
context network. This is likely due to the fact that
bi-directional information is already captured by
the context network, and may not be necessary in
the encoder itself.

We further compared the two systems on two
different languages, French and Chinese. We
achieved 0.5-0.8 BLEU improvement, showing
our proposed models are stable and consistent
across different language pairs. The results are
shown in Table 2.

To show that our 3-layer models are properly
trained, we ran a 3-layer bidirectional encoder
with residual networks on En-Fr and got 27.45 for
WMT13 and 30.60 for WMT14, which is similarly
lower than the two layer result. It should be noted
that previous work such as Britz et al. (2017) have

and our best proposed model on three different language pairs. Improvements are in italic. We performed bootstrap
resampling for 1000 times: our best model improved more on homographs than all words in terms of either f1,
precision, or recall with p < 0.05, indicating statistical significance across all measures.

also noted that the gains for encoders beyond two
layers is minimal.

6.3 Targeted Analysis

In order to examine whether our proposed model
can better translate words with multiple senses,
we evaluate our context-aware model on a list of
homographs extracted from Wikipedia7 compared
to the baseline model on three different language
pairs. For the baseline model, we choose the best-
performing model, as described in §6.2.

To do so, we first acquire the translation
of homographs in the source language using
fast-align (Dyer et al., 2013). We run
fast-align on all the parallel corpora includ-
ing training data and testing data8 because the un-
supervised nature of the algorithm requires it to
have a large amount of training data to obtain ac-
curate alignments. The settings follow the de-
fault command on fast-align github page including
heuristics combining forward and backward align-
ment. Since there might be multiple aligned words
in the target language given a word in source lan-
guage, we treat a match between the aligned trans-
lation of a targeted word of the reference and
the translation of a given model as true positives
and use F1, precision, and recall as our metrics,
and take the micro-average across all the sentence
pairs. 9 We calculated the scores for the 50000
words/characters from our source vocabulary us-
ing only English words. The results are shown in
Table 3. The table shows two interesting results:
(1) The score for the homographs is lower than the
score obtained from all the words in the vocabu-

are harder to translate with Chinese as the only ex-
ception.10 (2) The improvement of our proposed
model over baseline model is larger on the ho-
mographs compared to all the words in vocabu-
lary. This shows that although our context-aware
model is better overall, the improvements are par-
ticularly focused on words with multiple senses,
which matches the intuition behind the design of
the model.

6.4 Qualitative Analysis

We show sample translations on English-Chinese
WMT’17 dataset in Table 4 with three kinds of ex-
amples. We highlighted the English homograph
in bold, correctly translated words in blue, and
wrongly translated words in red. (1) Target homo-
graphs are translated into the correct sense with
the help of context network. For the first sample
translation, “meets” is correctly translated to “会
见” by our model, and wrongly translated to “符
合” by baseline model. In fact, “会见” is closer
to the definition “come together intentionally” and
“符合” is closer to ”satisfy” in the English dic-
tionary. (2) Target homographs are translated into
different but similar senses for both models in the
forth example. Both models translate the word
“believed” to common translations “被认为” or
“相信”, but these meaning are both close to ref-
erence translation “据信”. (3) Target homograph
is translated into the wrong sense for the baseline
model, but is not translated in our model in the
fifth example.

10One potential explanation for Chinese is that because the
Chinese results are generated on the character level, the auto-
matic alignment process was less accurate.

7 Related Work

Word sense disambiguation (WSD), the task of
determining the correct meaning or sense of a
word in context is a long standing task in NLP
(Yarowsky, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Mihalcea
and Faruque, 2004; Navigli, 2009; Zhong and
Ng, 2010; Di Marco and Navigli, 2013; Chen
et al., 2014; Camacho-Collados et al., 2015).
Recent research on tackling WSD and captur-
ing multi-senses includes work leveraging LSTM
(Kågebäck and Salomonsson, 2016; Yuan et al.,
2016), which we extended as a context network
in our paper and predicting senses with word
embeddings that capture context. Šuster et al.
(2016); Kawakami and Dyer (2016) also showed
that bilingual data improves WSD. In contrast to
the standard WSD formulation, Vickrey et al.
(2005) reformulated the task of WSD for Statisti-
cal Machine Translation (SMT) as predicting pos-
sible target translations which directly improves
the accuracy of machine translation. Following
this reformulation, Chan et al. (2007); Carpuat
and Wu (2007a,b) integrated WSD systems into

phrase-based systems. Xiong and Zhang (2014)
breaks the process into two stages. First predicts
the sense of the ambiguous source word. The pre-
dicted word senses together with other context fea-
tures are then used to predict possible target trans-
lation. Within the framework of Neural MT, there
are works that has similar motivation to ours. Choi
et al. (2017) leverage the NBOW as context and
gate the word-embedding on both encoder and de-
coder side. However, their work does not distin-
guish context vectors for words in the same se-
quence, in contrast to the method in this paper,
and our results demonstrate that this is an impor-
tant feature of methods that handle homographs
in NMT. In addition, our quantitative analysis of
the problems that homographs pose to NMT and
evaluation of how context-aware models fix them
was not covered in this previous work. Rios et al.
(2017) tackled the problem by adding sense em-
bedding learned with additional corpus and eval-
uated the performance on the sentence level with
contrastive translation.

8 Conclusion

Theoretically, NMT systems should be able to
handle homographs if the encoder captures the
clues to translate them correctly. In this paper, we
empirically show that this may not be the case; the
performance of word level translation degrades as
the number of senses for each word increases. We
hypothesize that this is due to the fact that each
word is mapped to a word vector despite them be-
ing in different contexts, and propose to integrate
methods from neural WSD systems into an NMT
system to alleviate this problem. We concatenated
the context vector computed from the context net-
work with the word embedding to form a context-
aware word embedding, successfully improving
the NMT system. We evaluated our model on
three different language pairs and outperformed a
strong baseline model according to BLEU score
in all of them. We further evaluated our results
targeting the translation of homographs, and our
model performed better in terms of F1 score.

While the architectures proposed in this work
do not solve the problem of homographs, our em-
pirical results in Table 3 demonstrate that they do
yield improvements (larger than those on other va-
rieties of words). We hope that this paper will
spark discussion on the topic, and future work will
propose even more focused architectures.
