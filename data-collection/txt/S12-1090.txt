Abstract 

This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI system, which 
participated in the first Semantic Textual 
Similarity task (STS) of SemEval-2012. Our 
supervised system uses different kinds of 
semantic and lexical features to train classifiers 
and it uses a voting process to select the correct 
option. Related to the different features we can 
highlight the resource ISR-WN1 used to extract 
semantic relations among words and the use of 
different algorithms to establish semantic and 
lexical similarities. In order to establish which 
features are the most appropriate to improve 
STS results we participated with three runs 
using different set of features. Our best 
approach reached the position 18 of 89 runs, 
obtaining a general correlation coefficient up to 
0.72. 

1. Introduction 

SemEval 2012 competition for evaluating Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) systems presents a 
new task called Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) 
(Agirre et al., 2012). In STS the participating 
systems must examine the degree of semantic 
equivalence between two sentences. The goal of 
this task is to create a unified framework for the 
evaluation of semantic textual similarity modules 
and to characterize their impact on NLP 
applications. 

STS is related to Textual Entailment (TE) and 
Paraphrase tasks. The main difference is that STS

 Integration of Semantic Resource based on WordNet. 

assumes bidirectional graded equivalence between 
the pair of textual snippets. In the case of TE the 
equivalence is directional (e.g. a student is a 
person, but a person is not necessarily a student). 
In addition, STS differs from TE and Paraphrase in 
that, rather than being a binary yes/no decision, 
STS is a similarity-graded notion (e.g. a student 
and a person are more similar than a dog and a 
person). This bidirectional gradation is useful for 
NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, 
Information Extraction, Question Answering, and 
Summarization. Several semantic tasks could be 
added as modules in the STS framework, “such as 
Word Sense Disambiguation and Induction, 
Lexical Substitution, Semantic Role Labeling, 
Multiword Expression detection and handling, 
Anaphora and Co-reference resolution, Time and 
Date resolution and Named Entity Recognition, 
among others”2  

1.1. Description of 2012 pilot task 

In STS, all systems were provided with a set of 
sentence pairs obtained from a segmented corpus. 
For each sentence pair, s1 and s2, all participants 
had to quantify how similar s1 and s2 were, 
providing a similarity score. The output of 
different systems was compared to the manual 
scores provided by SemEval-2012 gold standard 
file, which range from 5 to 0 according to the next 
criterions3:  
• (5) “The two sentences are equivalent, as they 

mean the same thing”.

• (4) “The two sentences are mostly equivalent, 
but some unimportant details differ”. 

• (3) “The two sentences are roughly equivalent, 
but some important information 
differs/missing”. 

• (2) “The two sentences are not equivalent, but 
share some details”. 

• (1) “The two sentences are not equivalent, but 
are on the same topic”. 

• (0) “The two sentences are on different topics”. 
After this introduction, the rest of the paper is 

organized as follows. Section 2 shows the 
architecture of our system and a description of the 
different runs. In section 3 we describe the 
algorithms and methods used to obtain the features 
for our system, and Section 4 describe the training 
phase. The obtained results and a discussion are 
provided in Section 5, and finally the conclusions 
and future works in Section 6. 

2. System architecture and description of 
the runs 

As we can see in Figure 1 our three runs begin 
with the pre-processing of SemEval 2012’s 
training set. Every sentence pair is tokenized, 
lemmatized and POS tagged using Freeling tool 
(Atserias et al., 2006). Afterwards, several 
methods and algorithms are applied in order to 
extract all features for our Machine Learning 
System (MLS). Each run uses a particular group of 
features. 

The Run 1 (MultiSemLex) is our main run. 
This takes into account all extracted features and 
trains a model with a Voting classifier composed 
by the following techniques: Bagging (using M5P), 
Bagging (using REPTree), Random SubSpace 
(using REPTree) and MP5. The training corpus has 
been provided by SemEval-2012 competition, in 
concrete by the Semantic Textual Similarity task.  

The Runs 2 and 3 use the same classifier, but 
including different features. Run 2 (MultiLex) uses 
(see Figure 1) features extracted from Lexical-
Semantic Metrics (LS-M) described in section 3.1, 
Lexical-Semantic Alignment (LS-A) described in 
section 3.2 and Sentiment Polarity (SP) described 
in section 3.3.  

On the other hand, the Run 3 (MultiSem) uses 
features extracted only from Semantic Alignment 
(SA) described in section 3.4 and the textual edit 
distances named QGram-Distances. 

 
Figure 1. System Architecture. 

As a result, we obtain three trained models 
capable to estimate the similarity value between 
two sentences. 

Finally, we test our system with the SemEval 
2012 test set (see Table 7 with the results of our 
three runs). The following section describes the 
features extraction process.

3. Description of the features used in the 
Machine Learning System 

Sometimes, when two sentences are very similar, 
one sentence is in a high degree lexically 
overlapped by the other. Inspired by this fact we 
developed various algorithms, which measure the 
level of overlapping by computing a quantity of 
matching words (the quantity of lemmas that 
correspond exactly by its morphology) in a pair of 
sentences. In our system, we used lexical and 
semantic similarity measures as features for a 
MLS. Other features were extracted from a lexical-
semantic sentences alignment and a variant using 
only a semantic alignment.  

3.1. Similarity measures 

We have used well-known string based similarity 
measures like: Needleman-Wunch (NW) (sequence 
alignment), Smith-Waterman (SW) (sequence 
alignment), Jaro, Jaro-Winkler (JaroW), Chapman-
Mean-Length (CMLength), QGram-Distance 
(QGramD), Block-Distance (BD), Jaccard 
Similarity (JaccardS), Monge-Elkan (ME) and 
Overlap-Coefficient (OC). These algorithms have 
been obtained from an API (Application Program 
Interface) SimMetrics library v1.54 for .NET 2.0. 
Copyright (c) 2006 by Chris Parkinson. We 
obtained 10 features for our MLS from these 
similarity measures. 

Using Levenshtein’s edit distance (LED), we 
computed also two different algorithms in order to 
obtain the alignment of the phrases. In the first 
one, we considered a value of the alignment as the 
LED between two sentences and the normalized 
variant named NomLED. Contrary to (Tatu et al., 
2006), we do not remove the punctuation or stop 
words from the sentences, neither consider 
different cost for transformation operation, and we 
used all the operations (deletion, insertion and 
substitution). The second one is a variant that we 
named Double Levenshtein’s Edit Distance 
(DLED). For this algorithm, we used LED to 
measure the distance between the sentences, but to 
compare the similarity between the words, we used 
LED again. Another feature is the normalized 
variant of DLED named NomDLED. 

The unique difference between classic LED 
algorithm and DLED is the comparison of 

                                                   
4 http://sourceforge.net/projects/simmetrics/ 

similitude between two words. With LED should 
be: �[�] = �[�], whereas for our DLED we 
calculate words similarity also with LED (e.g. ��	�(�[�], �[�]) <= 2). Values above a decision 
threshold (experimentally 2) mean unequal words. 
We obtain as result two new different features 
from these algorithms. 

Another distance we used is an extension of 
LED named Extended Distance (EDx) (see 
(Fernández Orquín et al., 2009) for details). This 
algorithm is an extension of the Levenshtein’s 
algorithm, with which penalties are applied by 
considering what kind of operation or 
transformation is carried out (insertion, deletion, 
substitution, or non-operation) in what position, 
along with the character involved in the operation. 
In addition to the cost matrixes used by 
Levenshtein’s algorithm, EDx also obtains the 
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) 
(Hirschberg, 1977) and other helpful attributes for 
determining similarity between strings in a single 
iteration. It is worth noting that the inclusion of all 
these penalizations makes the EDx algorithm a 
good candidate for our approach. In our previous 
work (Fernández Orquín et al., 2009), EDx 
demonstrated excellent results when it was 
compared with other distances as (Levenshtein, 
1965), (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), (Winkler, 
1999). How to calculate EDx is briefly described 
as follows (we refer reader to (Fernández Orquín et 
al., 2009) for a further description): 

EDx = �∑  �����∗����� !,���"#�$(%&'()*+),-�.-��/0 1
2

; 
(1) 

 

 

Where: 3 - Transformations accomplished on the words (4, 5, �, 6). 4 - Not operations at all, 5 - Insertion, � - Deletion, 6 - Substitution.  
We formalize 3 as a vector: 
3 =

89:
9;(0,0)(1,0) :: ?�(0,1)(1,1) :: @�A9B

9C
 

D1 and D2 - The examined words D1j - The j-th character of the word D1 
610



D2k - The k-th character of the word D2 E - The weight of each character 
We can vary all this weights in order to make a 

flexible penalization to the interchangeable 
characters.  ED1j - The weight of characters at D1j ED2k - The weight of characters at D2k 
F = GF + 1 �� 4i ≠ 5F �� 4i = 5 J ; K = LK + 1 �� 4i ≠ �K �� 4i = � M � - The biggest word length of the language N - Edit operations length 4i - Operation at (�) position OPQR - Greatest value of E ranking 
S =  T 2OUVW(2OUVW + 1)XYZ+X[\  (2) 

As we can see in the equation (1), the term 3(]^) ∗ �E�_+`�, E(_%a)! is the Cartesian product that 
analyzes the importance of doing i-th operation 
between the characters at j-th and k-th position 
The term (2Rcde + 1)fZg in equation (1) penalizes 
the position of the operations. The most to the left 
hand the operation is the highest the penalization 
is. The term S (see equation (2) normalizes the 
EDx into [0,1] interval. This measure is also used 
as a feature for the system. 

We also used as a feature the Minimal 
Semantic Distances (Breadth First Search (BFS)) 
obtained between the most relevant concepts of 
both sentences. The relevant concepts pertain to 
semantic resources ISR-WN (Gutiérrez et al., 
2011a; 2010b), as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), 
WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004), 
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) and Semantic 
Classes (Izquierdo et al., 2007). Those concepts 
were obtained after having applied the Association 
Ratio (AR) measure between concepts and words 
over each sentence. The obtained distances for 
each resource SUMO, WordNet Affect, WordNet 
and Semantic Classes are named SDist, AffDist, 
WNDist and SCDist respectively. 

ISR-WN, takes into account different kind of 
labels linked to WN: Level Upper Concepts 
(SUMO), Domains and Emotion labels. In this 
work, our purpose is to use a semantic network, 
which links different semantic resources aligned to 
WN. After several tests, we decided to apply ISR-
WN. Although others resources provide different 
semantic relations, ISR-WN has the highest 

quantity of semantic dimensions aligned, so it is a 
suitable resource to run our algorithm.  

Using ISR-WN we are able to extract 
important information from the interrelations of 
four ontological resources: WN, WND, WNA and 
SUMO. ISR-WN resource is based on WN1.6 or 
WN2.0 versions. In the last updated version, 
Semantic Classes and SentiWordNet were also 
included. Furthermore, ISR-WN provides a tool 
that allows the navigation across internal links. At 
this point, we can discover the multidimensionality 
of concepts that exists in each sentence. In order to 
establish the concepts associated to each sentence 
we apply Relevant Semantic Trees (Gutiérrez et 
al., 2010a; Gutiérrez et al., 2011b) approach using 
the provided links of ISR-WN. We refer reader to 
(Gutiérrez et al., 2010a) for a further description. 

3.2. Lexical-Semantic alignment 

Another algorithm that we created is the Lexical-
Semantic Alignment. In this algorithm, we tried to 
align the sentences by its lemmas. If the lemmas 
coincide we look for coincidences among parts of 
speech, and then the phrase is realigned using both. 
If the words do not share the same part of speech, 
they will not be aligned. Until here, we only have 
taken into account a lexical alignment. From now 
on, we are going to apply a semantic variant. After 
all the process, the non-aligned words will be 
analyzed taking into account its WorldNet’s 
relations (synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy, 
derivationally – related – form, similar-to, verbal 
group, entailment and cause-to relation); and a set 
of equivalencies like abbreviations of months, 
countries, capitals, days and coins. In the case of 
the relation of hyperonymy and hyponymy, the 
words will be aligned if there is a word in the first 
sentence that is in the same relation (hyperonymy 
or hyponymy) of another one in the second 
sentence. For the relations of “cause-to” and 
“implication” the words will be aligned if there is a 
word in the first sentence that causes or implicates 
another one of the second sentence. All the other 
types of relations will be carried out in 
bidirectional way, that is, there is an alignment if a 
word of the first sentence is a synonymous of 
another one belonging to the second one or vice 
versa. Finally, we obtain a value we called 
alignment relation. This value is calculated as hi3 =  Sij / Sj6E. Where hi3 is the final 

611



alignment value, Sij is the number of aligned 
word and Sj6E is the number of words of the 
shorter phrase. This value is also another feature 
for our system. 

3.3. Sentiment Polarity Feature 

Another feature is obtained calculating 
SentiWordNet Polarities matches of the analyzed 
sentences (see (Gutiérrez et al., 2011c) for detail). 
This analysis has been applied from several 
dimensions (WordNet, WordNet Domains, 
WordNet Affect, SUMO, and Semantic Classes) 
where the words with sentimental polarity offer to 
the relevant concepts (for each conceptual resource 
from ISR-WN (e.g. WordNet, WordNet Domains, 
WordNet Affect, SUMO, and Semantic Classes)) 
its polarity values. Other analysis were the 
integration of all results of polarity in a measure 
and further a voting process where all polarities 
output are involved (for more details see 
(Fernández et al., 2012)). 

The final measure corresponds to E3 =E?N6+ + E?N6%, where E?N61 is a polarity value of 
the sentence 61 and E?N6% is a polarity value of the 
sentence 62. The negative, neutral, and positive 
values of polarities are represented as -1, 0 and 1 
respectively. 

3.4. Semantic Alignment 

This alignment method depends on calculating the 
semantic similarity between sentences based on an 
analysis of the relations, in ISR-WN, of the words 
that fix them. 

First, the two sentences are pre-processed with 
Freeling and the words are classified according to 
their parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, and 
adverbs.).  

We take 30% of the most probable senses of 
every word and we treat them as a group. The 
distance between two groups will be the minimal 
distance between senses of any pair of words 
belonging to the group. For example: 

 
Figure 2. Minimal Distance between “Run” and 

“Chase”. 

In the example of Figure 2 the ���� = 2 is 
selected for the pair “Run-Chase”, because this 
pair has the minimal cost=2.  

For nouns and the words that are not found in 
WordNet like common nouns or Christian names, 
the distance is calculated in a different way. In this 
case, we used LED. 

Let's see the following example: 
We could take the pair 99 of corpus MSRvid 

(from training set) with a litter of transformation in 
order to a better explanation of our method. 
Original pair 
A: A polar bear is running towards a group of 
walruses. 
B: A polar bear is chasing a group of walruses. 
Transformed pair: 
A1: A polar bear runs towards a group of cats. 
B1: A wale chases a group of dogs. 

Later on, using the algorithm showed in the 
example of Figure 2, a matrix with the distances 
between all groups of both sentences is created 
(see Table 1). 

GROUPS polar bear runs towards group cats 
wale Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=3 Dist:=5  Dist:=2 
chases Dist:=4 Dist:=3 Dist:=2 Dist:=4  Dist:=3 
group     Dist:=0  
dogs Dist:=3 Dist:=1 Dist:=4 Dist:=4  Dist:=1 

Table 1. Distances between the groups. 

Using the Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn, 1955) 
for Minimum Cost Assignment, each group of the 
smaller sentence is checked with an element of the 
biggest sentence and the rest is marked as words 
that were not aligned. 

In the previous example the words “toward” 
and “polar” are the words that were not aligned, so 
the number of non-aligned words is 2. There is 
only one perfect match: “group-group” (match 
with D?�� = 0). The length of the shortest sentence 
is 4. The Table 2 shows the results of this analysis.

Table 2. Features extracted from the analyzed sentences. 

This process has to be repeated for the verbs,

the contrary, the tables have to be created only 
with the similar groups of the sentences. Table 3

Table 4. Feature extracted the analysis of nouns. 

Several attributes are extracted from the pair of 
sentences. Four attributes from the entire 
sentences, four attributes considering only verbs, 
only nouns, only adjectives, and only adverbs. 
These attributes are:  
• Number of exact coincidences (Same) 
• Total distance of optimal matching (Cost). 
• Number of words that do not match (Dif). 
• Number of lemmas of the shortest sentence 

(Min). 
As a result, we finally obtain 20 attributes from 

this alignment method. For each part-of-speech, 

the attributes are represented adding to its names 
the characters N, V, A and R to represent features 
for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs 
respectively. 

It is important to remark that this alignment 
process searches to solve, for each word from the 
rows (see Table 3) its respectively word from the 
columns. 

4. Description of the training phase 

For the training process, we used a supervised 
learning framework, including all the training set 
(MSRpar, MSRvid and SMTeuroparl) as a training 
corpus. Using 10 fold cross validation with the 
classifier mentioned in section 2 (experimentally 
selected). 

As we can see in Table 5, the features: FAV, 
EDx, CMLength, QGramD, BD, Same, SameN, 
obtain values over 0.50 of correlation. The more 
relevant are EDx and QGramD, which were 
selected as a lexical base for the experiment in Run 
3. It is important to remark that feature SameN and 
Same only using number of exact coincidences 
obtain an encourage value of correlation.

Table 5. Correlation of individual features over all training sets. 

 
We decide to include the Sentiment Polarity as 

a feature, because our previous results on Textual 
Entailment task in (Fernández et al., 2012). But, 
contrary to what we obtain in this paper, the 
influence of the polarity (PV) for this task is very 
low, its contribution working together with other 

features is not remarkable, but neither negative 
(Table 6), So we decide remaining in our system. 

In oder to select the lexical base for Run 3 
(MultiSem, features marked in bold) we compared 
the individual influences of the best lexical 
features (EDx, QGramD, CMLength), obtaining 

613



the 0.82, 0.83, 0.81 respectively (Table 6). Finally, 
we decided to use QGramD. 

The conceptual features SDist, AffDist, 
WNDist, SCDist do not increase the similarity 
score, this is due to the generality of the obtained 
concept, losing the essential characteristic between 
both sentences. Just like with PV we decide to 
keep them in our system. 

As we can see in Table 5, when all features are 
taking into account the system obtain the best 
score.

5. Result and discussion 

Semantic Textual Similarity task of SemEval-2012 
offered three official measures to rank the 
systems5: 
1. ALL: Pearson correlation with the gold 

standard for the five datasets, and 
corresponding rank. 

2. ALLnrm: Pearson correlation after the system 
outputs for each dataset are fitted to the gold 

                                                   
5 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-
2012/task6/index.php?id=results-update 

standard using least squares, and 
corresponding rank. 

3. Mean: Weighted mean across the five datasets, 
where the weight depends on the number of 
pairs in the dataset. 

4. Pearson for individual datasets. 

Using these measures, our main run (Run 1) 
obtained the best results (see Table 7). This 
demonstrates the importance of tackling this 
problem from a multidimensional lexical-semantic 
point of view.

The Run 2 uses a lot of lexical analysis and not 
much of semantic analysis. For this reason, the 
results for Run 2 is poorer (in comparison to the 
Run 3) (see Table 7) for the test sets: SMT-eur, 
On-WN and SMT-news. Of course, these tests 
have more complex semantic structures than the 
others. However, for test MSRpar it function better 
and for test MSRvid it functions very similar to 
Run 3. 

Otherwise, the Run 3 uses more semantic 
analysis that Run 2 (it uses all features mentioned 
except feature marked in bold on Table 6) and only 
one lexical similarity measure (QGram-Distance). 
This makes it to work better for test sets SMT-eur, 
On-WN and SMT-news (see Table 7). It is 
important to remark that this run obtains important 
results for the test SMT-news, positioning this 
variant in the fifth place of 89 runs. Moreover, it is 
interesting to notice (Table 7) that when mixing the 
semantic features with the lexical one (creating 
Run 1) it makes the system to improve its general 
results, except for the test: SMT-eur, On-WN and 
SMT-news in comparison with Run 3. For these 
test sets seem to be necessary more semantic 
analysis than lexical in order to improve similarity 
estimation. We assume that Run 1 is non-balance 
according to the quantity of lexical and semantic 
features, because this run has a high quantity of 

614



lexical and a few of semantic analysis. For that 
reason, Run 3 has a better performance than Run 1 
for these test sets. 

Even when the semantic measures demonstrate 
significant results, we do not discard the lexical 
help on Run 3. After doing experimental 
evaluations on the training phase, when lexical 
feature from QGram-Distance is not taken into 
account, the Run 3 scores decrease. This 
demonstrates that at least a lexical base is 
necessary for the Semantic Textual Similarity 
systems. 

6. Conclusion and future works 

This paper introduced a new framework for 
recognizing Semantic Textual Similarity, which 
depends on the extraction of several features that 
can be inferred from a conventional interpretation 
of a text. 

As mentioned in section 2 we have conducted 
three different runs, these runs only differ in the 
type of attributes used. We can see in Table 7 that 
all runs obtained encouraging results. Our best run 
was placed between the first 18th positions of the 
ranking of Semeval 2012 (from 89 Runs) in all 
cases. Table 8 shows the reached positions for the 
three different runs and the ranking according to 
the rest of the teams.  

In our participation, we used a MLS that works 
with features extracted from five different 
strategies: String Based Similarity Measures, 
Semantic Similarity Measures, Lexical-Semantic 
Alignment, Semantic Alignment, and Sentiment 
Polarity Cross-checking. 

We have conducted the semantic features 
extraction in a multidimensional context using the 
resource ISR-WN, the one that allowed us to 
navigate across several semantic resources 
(WordNet, WordNet Domains, WordNet Affect, 
SUMO, SentiWorNet and Semantic Classes). 

Finally, we can conclude that our system 
performs quite well. In our current work, we show 
that this approach can be used to correctly classify 
several examples from the STS task of SemEval-
2012. Comparing with the best run (UKP_Run2 
(see Table 9)) of the ranking our main run has very 
closed results. In two times we increased the best 
UKP’s run (UKP_Run 2), for MSRvid test set in 
0.2824 points and for On-WN test set in 0.1319 
points (see Table 10).

It is important to remark that we do not expand 
any corpus to train the classifier of our system. 
This fact locates us at disadvantage according to 
other teams that do it.

As future work we are planning to enrich our 
semantic alignment method with Extended 
WordNet (Moldovan and Rus, 2001), we think that 
with this improvement we can increase the results 
obtained with texts like those in On-WN test set.
