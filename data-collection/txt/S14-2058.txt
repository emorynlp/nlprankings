Abstract

This work analyses various syntactic and
lexical features for sentence level aspect
based sentiment analysis. The task fo-
cuses on detection of a writer’s sentiment
towards an aspect which is explicitly men-
tioned in a sentence. The target sentiment
polarities are positive, negative, conflict
and neutral. We use a supervised learning
approach, evaluate various features and
report accuracies which are much higher
than the provided baselines. Best features
include unigrams, clauses, dependency re-
lations and SentiWordNet polarity scores.

1 Introduction

The term aspect refers to the features or aspects
of a product, service or topic being discussed in a
text. The task of detection of sentiment towards
these aspects involves two major processing steps,
identifying the aspects in the text and identifying
the sentiments towards these aspects. Our work
describes a submitted system in the Aspect Based
Sentiment Analysis task of SemEval 2014 (Pontiki
et al., 2014). The task was further divided into 4
subtasks; our work corresponds to the subtask 2,
called Aspect Term Polarity Detection. We pre-
dict the polarity of sentiments expressed towards
the aspect terms which are already annotated in a
sentence. The target polarity types are positive,
negative, neutral and conflict.
We employ a statistical classifier and experiment
with various syntactic and lexical features. Se-
lected features for the submitted system include
words which hold certain dependency relations
with the aspect terms, clause in which the aspect

term appears, unigrams, and sum of lexicon based
sentiment polarities of the words in the clause.

2 Related Work

Pang et al. (2002) proved that unigrams and
bigrams, adjectives and part of speech tags are
important features for a machine learning based
sentiment classifier. Later, verbs and adjectives
were also identified as important features (Ches-
ley, 2006). Meena and Prabhakar (2007) per-
formed sentence level sentiment analysis using
rules based on clauses of a sentence. However,
in our case we cannot simply consider the adjec-
tives and verbs as features, since they might re-
late to different aspects. For example, in the sen-
tence ‘The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted
pizza.’, sentiment towards ‘pizza’ is positive be-
cause of the adjective ‘best’; however for the term
‘thin crusted pizza’, ‘like’ would be the sentiment
verb. Therefore, only those adjectives and verbs
which relate to the target aspect, can be consid-
ered as the indicator of their polarity. Wilson et
al. (2009) showed that the words which share cer-
tain dependency relations with aspect terms, tend
to indicate the sentiments expressed towards those
terms.
Saif et al. (2012) showed the co-relation between
topic and sentiment polarity in tweets, and as-
serted that majority of people tend to express sim-
ilar sentiments towards same topics, especially in
the case of positive sentiments. The baseline ap-
proach for this task (Pontiki et al., 2014) also as-
sociates polarity with aspect terms. Therefore, we
also consider aspect term as a potential feature.
Our approach for this task is based on our obser-
vation of the data, with a provenance of the above
mentioned findings.

3 Approach

We employ a statistical classifier which trains on
the provided training datasets.

346



Datasets: Training datasets comprise of 3000 sen-
tences from laptop and restaurant reviews. Train-
ing sentences were tagged with the target aspect
term and the corresponding polarity, where more
than one aspect term can be tagged in a sentence.

3.1 Feature Sets

We divide the candidate features into four feature
sets.

1. Non-contextual: These features comprise of
training vocabulary. They do not target as-
pect based sentiments, but the overall senti-
ment of the sentence. There might be cases
where the aspect based sentiment is same as
the overall sentiment of the sentence. The
feature set comprises of three feature types,
unigrams, bigrams, adjectives and verbs of
the sentence.

2. Lexicon Non-Contextual: These features
are the Sentiwordnet v3.0 polarity scores
(Andrea Baccianella and Sebastiani, 2010)
of the words obtained from the best non-
contextual feature type. This feature set
would include two numerical features, posi-
tive polarity score and negative polarity score
of the best non-contextual feature types. Best
non-contextual feature type is decided by
comparing the classification accuracies of in-
dividual feature types, with cross validation
on the training data (Table 1). We evaluated
two algorithms to obtain the positive and neg-
ative polarities of words using SentiWordNet.
Later, we would provide details of these algo-
rithms.

3. Contextual: These features target aspect
based sentiments. Feature types comprise of
the clause in which an aspect term appears,
the adjective and verbs of this clause, aspect
term itself, and the words which hold certain
dependency relations with aspect term. We
only considered the Stanford parser depen-
dencies ‘nn’, ‘amod’, and ‘nsubj’. The de-
pendency relations were chosen on the basis
of best classification accuracy in a cross vali-
dation trial, where the only features were the
words holding different dependency relations
with the aspect term. However, we only list
the accuracy from the best performing depen-
dency relations in the Tables 1, 3. By the fea-

ture type clause, we mean the unigrams con-
tained in a clause.

4. Lexicon Contextual: Similar to Lexicon
Non-Contextual features, these are the nu-
meric values obtained from SentiWordNet
polarity scores of the best performing contex-
tual feature type.

Polarity Calculation using SentiWordNet:
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a lexical database
for the English language. It assigns each listed
word the senses to which it may belong, where
each unique sense is represented by a synset id.
SentiWordNet is built on the top of WordNet,
where a pair of positive and negative polarity
score is assigned to each sense of a word. Senti-
Wordnet entry for each word comprises of all the
possible parts of speech in which the word could
appear, all the senses corresponding to each part
of speech, and a pair of polarity scores associated
with each sense 1. The magnitude of positive and
negative polarity scores for each sense ranges
from 0 to 1.
In order to automatically obtain the polarity
scores corresponding to the desired sense of a
word, word sense disambiguation is required
to be performed. We did not perform sense
disambiguation, and picked the polarity scores
simply on the basis of word and part of speech
matching. This gives more than one candidate
senses, and thus more than one pair of polarity
scores for each word. We evaluated the following
2 methods to assign single values of sentiment
polarity scores to each word.

1. Default: The SentiWordnet website 2 pro-
vides a basic algorithm to assign sentiword-
net based polarities to a word. SentiWordnet
assigns a rank to each sense of a word, where
most commonly appearing sense is ranked
as 1. The default algorithm first calculates
an overall polarity (Positive score - Negative
score), for each sense of a word. It then cal-
culates a weighted sum of the overall polarity
scores of all the senses of a word, where the
weights are the ranks of senses. This sum is
considered as a single value polarity score of
a word, which can be a positive or negative
number.

2. Our algorithm: We do not obtain an overall
polarity score for each word, but we obtain a
pair of aggregated negative and positive score
for each word. Aggregate positive score is
obtained by taking the average of the positive
scores of each sense of the word, and same
goes for the aggregate negative score.

One reason for keeping the positive and negative
scores separate in our algorithm is that the task
also involves sentiment classes conflict and neu-
tral. Using only the overall polarity score results
in a loss of information in the case of very low neg-
ativity and positivity (neutral sentiments), or high
but comparable negativity and positivity (conflict-
ing sentiments). Also, our algorithm produced
better results when used with an SVM classifier,
with features as unigrams and their polarity scores.

3.2 Classifier Model

Our system is built on the state of the art LibSVM
classifier (EL-Manzalawy and Honavar, 2005).
We used Weka 3.7.10 toolkit (Hall et al., 2009) for
our experiments. The parameters 3 of the SVM
classifier are tuned to the values which give best
results with unigrams. Table 2 provides the tuned
parameters, rest of the parameters are set at default
values.
Pre-processing: We perform stemming using
Weka’s implementation of Snowball stemmer,
convert strings to lower case and filter out stop-
words. We use a customised list of stopwords,
based on our observations of the data. The cus-
tomised list is created using the stopword list of
Weka, with certain words removed. For example,
negators like ’not’, ’didn’t’ etc. are important for
negative sentiments, for example ‘I can barely use
any usb devices because they will not stay prop-
erly connected’. Words like ‘but’, ‘however’ are
prominent in conflicting sentiments, for example
‘No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me’. Ta-
bles 1, 3 show the difference in results on using fil-
tered stopword list, compared against no stopword
removal, and original stopword list.

3.3 Feature Evaluation
We evaluated our features using 8-fold cross val-
idation on the training data. We evaluated each
feature by using it as the only feature for the clas-
sifier (Tables 1, 3). We performed experiments
on different combinations of features, but we only
present the best performing combination of fea-
tures in the last row of the tables. The baseline
approach (Pontiki et al., 2014) provided by the or-
ganisers, produced an accuracy of 47% for laptop
and 57% for restaurant, by splitting the training
data.
Metrics include, F score for each class, and overall
classification accuracy. F score ranges from 0-1,
and overall accuracy range from 0-100.

4 Submission and Results

Submission involved the prediction of sentiment
polarity towards the already tagged aspect terms
in two test datasets. There were 800 sentences
in each test dataset. The laptop test dataset was
obtained by dividing the original laptop data into
training and test. However, restaurant test dataset
and training dataset come from different sources.
We trained our classifier using the provided train-
ing dataset and the highlighted features (last row)
in the Tables 1, 3. In order to evaluate the submis-
sion, gold standard datasets corresponding to each
test dataset were later released, and submission’s
accuracy was compared against it.
Results: The system performance was evaluated
and ranked on the basis of overall accuracy of sen-
timent prediction. We were ranked as 20/32 for
the laptop domain, and 16/34 for the restaurant
domain. The task organisers reported that 8 polar-
ity predictions for laptop data, and 34 for restau-
rant data were missing from our submission. We
later debugged our system, and obtained the actual
accuracy which our system is capable of produc-
ing with the given test data. The results are sum-
marised in Table 4.

5 Observations and Analysis

We hypothesize that aspect terms should serve as
features when training data and test data come
from same source, which means that they relate
to the same brand, product, service etc. This is
because aspect terms change with data, for exam-
ple names of dishes would change with different
restaurants even if the domain is same. In our
case, the laptop test data was obtained from the

same dataset which was used to prepare training
data, while restaurant was from a different source.
We observed that, although aspect terms produced
better results with cross validation, it did not hap-
pen in the case of test data. The restaurant test data
produced better accuracy without aspect term fea-
tures, while laptop test data produced better accu-
racy with aspect term features. We submitted our
systems without using aspect terms as features. If
aspect terms were used as features, the laptop test
data would have been classified with an accuracy
of 60.8 %. Another interesting observation is, uni-
grams produce better results on their own, as com-
pared to adjectives and verbs. Dependency and
clauses also seem to be very important features,
since they produce an accuracy of above 60% on
their own. We also observed that some stopwords
are important features for this task, and complete
removal of stopwords lowers the classification ac-
curacy.

6 Conclusion

We presented an analysis and evaluation of syn-
tactic and lexical features for performing sentence
level aspect based sentiment analysis. Our fea-
tures depend on part of speech tagging and depen-
dency parsing, and therefore the accuracy might
vary with different parsers. Although our system
did not produce the highest accuracy for the task, it
is capable of achieving accuracies much above the
baselines. Therefore, the proposed features can be
worth testing on different datasets and can be used
in combination with other features.
