Abstract

Good scientific writing is a skill researchers seek to acquire. Textbook literature provides guide-
lines to improve scientific writing, for instance, “use active voice when describing your own
work”. In this paper we investigate to what extent researchers adhere to textbook principles in
their articles. In our analyses we examine a set of selected principles which (i) are general and
(ii) verifiable by applying text mining and natural language processing techniques. We develop
a framework to automatically analyse a large data set containing ∼14.000 scientific articles re-
ceived from Mendeley and PubMed. We are interested in whether adhering to writing principles
is related to scientific quality, scientific domain or gender and whether these relations change
over time. Our results show (i) a clear relation between journal quality and scientific impreci-
sion, i.e. journals with low impact factors exhibit higher numbers of imprecision indicators such
as number of citation bunches and number of relativating words and (ii) that writing style partly
depends on domain characteristics and preferences.

1 Introduction

Writing good scientific articles is a skill. Researchers seek to acquire this skill for the purpose of succes-
fully disseminating their ideas to the scientific community. Learning to write good articles is a process
that for most of us starts at graduate level and keeps us company in the course of our careers. To advance
the learning process, there is (i) plenty of literature out there containing do’s and dont’s, (ii) seniors
administering doses of advice and (iii) entire lectures dedicated to this very subject.

In this paper, we investigate whether researchers do adhere to general writing principles taken from
textbook literature. We are interested in whether adhering to writing principles is related to the journal
quality, the scientific domain or gender and whether there is a change over time. Doing so allows us to
better understand which and to what extent theoretical guidelines are practically implemented. Devia-
tions from textbook literature could be indicators of good practice and if they occur frequently enough,
they might also be candidates for textbook updates.

Studying current trends in academic writing (cf. (Tas, 2010)) originates in the domains of pragmatics
and linguistics. In this research area we recognize two larger directions. The first one seeks to relate
an article’s content to scientific concepts, for instance, whether an article contains a theory or not (cf.
(Pettigrew et al., 2001)) or to scientific discourse elements, for instance, which paragraphs can be related
to categories such as Motivation or Experiment (cf. (Liakata et al., 2012)). The other direction focuses
more on organisation and structure including the analysis of entire scientific theses (cf. (Paltridge, 2002))
or the analysis of single structural elements such as the title (cf. (Soler, 2007), (Haggan, 2003)).

In contrast to previous work, we conduct our analyses at a larger scale. We thus develop a framework
to automatically analyze large amounts of scientific articles. In our experiments we select writing prin-
ciples which are on the one hand general and often recommended in textbook literature (cf. (Lebrun,
2007), (Alley, 1996)) and on the other hand automatically retrievable and verifiable by applying text

mining and natural language processing techniques. To give an example, the principle “use active voice
when describing your own work” is a popular one and can be verified by examining the verb types in the
article’s abstract, introduction and conclusion. In our study we analyze two data sets - one from Mende-
ley1, a popular reference management tool, - one from PubMed2, a free resource containing citations
for biomedical literature. We can observe relations between journal quality and textbook recommenda-
tions such as Avoid Imprecision and Engage the Reader. In addition, the results indicate writing style
preferences due to domain characteristics. Our findings show that theoretical guidelines partly concur
with practical implementation and thus contribute to better understand the extent to which theory guides
praxis and vice versa praxis might guide theory.

The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides details on the used data sets as well
as the software framework to automate the analysis of scientific articles. Section 3 contains experimen-
tal results and discussions of analyzed writing principles. Related work is covered in Section 4 and
concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.

2 Experimental Setup

2.1 Data Sets
For our analyses we used scientific articles from two sources - Mendeley and PubMed - which also
provided us with meta data, e.g. name of the conference or journal. Most of the publication organs were
journals and we decided to select only journals which had a minimum of 10 articles and for which we
could find a respective 5-year impact factor3. We decided to conduct our analyses over a 10-year time
period from 2001 to 2010, since only in this period articles from both sources were available. In total we
experimented with 13866 scientific articles. Grouping them according to scientific quality, domain and
gender, we constructed three data sets described in the following:

- Quality: According to the impact factor (IF), we divided the scientific articles into three groups; low
IF ranging from 0 to 2.5 (2303 articles), middle IF ranging from 2.5 to 4 (5734 articles) and high
IF ranging from 4 to 35 (5829 articles). The ranges were chosen to reflect the journal quality while
containing an appropriate (not too small) number of scientific articles per category.

- Domain: We divided the scientific articles by their journal type into two groups: biomedical (7053
articles) and a technical (6813 articles) which contained mainly articles from physics and computer
science.

- Gender: We used two gazetteer lists to identify female4 or male5 first authors. Since only a part
of the authors’ first names was unabbreviated, we used a subset of articles for these experiments:
number of articles with male first author = 1182, number of articles with female first author = 1990.

2.2 Framework
To automatically analyze large amounts of scientific articles, we designed a framework and embedded
our analysis algorithms in a Hadoop6 environment. The environment allows parallelization of processes
and thus greatly reduces computation time. We stored the results in a PostgreSQL7 database for quick
access and used various Python packages such as matplotlib8 for creating graphical representations of
our results.

Our first pre-processing step encompassed the extraction of textual content from scientific publica-
tions. To automatically extract the content, we used a processing pipeline (cf. (Klampfl et al., 2013))

that applies various machine learning techniques in combination with heuristics to detect the logical
structure of a PDF document. Further processing steps included (i) tokenization, (ii) sentence splitting,
(iii) stemming, (iv) part-of-speech tagging and (v) chunking. We employed part-of-speech and chunking
information in our analyses (see Section 3) to distinguish verb phrases with respect to present vs. past
tense as well as active vs. passive voice.

3 Analysis of Scientific Literature

In this section we analyze a set of selected writing style principles with respect to Reader Engagement
and Imprecision. Each analysis contains (i) a motivating statement mostly taken from (Lebrun, 2007), (ii)
a visual representation of results and (iii) an interpretation of results. During our experiments we could
observe that most of the time there were no significant differences between articles written by male and
female first authors. We repeated the experiments with a majority criterion of authors, i.e. more female
first names or more male first names per article, resulting in similar findings. It appears that both genders
adhere to the same guidelines which were standardly used at the time.

3.1 Engaging the Reader
In this section we examine different means to engage the reader according to textbook literature including
(i) the title, (ii) figures & tables and (iii) a lively writing style based on using present tense and active
voice.

3.1.1 Title
The title represents the first point of contact with the reader (and the reviewer) and should ideally be
made catchy and standing out. We examine three means to do that: (i) usage of verbs to increase energy,
(ii) usage of acronyms to provide a reference shortcut for others and (iii) usage of questions to create a
hook. Figure 1 contains average numbers of article titles with respect to these means.

Figure 1: Illustration of (i) titles containting at least one verb (left), (ii) titles containing acronyms (mid-
dle) and (iii) titles which contain a question (right) over a ten-year time period. The upper row reflect
distinction by domain, the lower row by impact factor. The y-axis represents the average number of
article titles exhibiting the respective feature.

The upper left figure in Figure 1 tells us that using verbs in titles is more common among authors in
the biomedical domain than in the physics/computer science domain. The lower left figure indicates a
trend towards using more verbs in the title over the years independent of the journal quality. The upper,
middle figure of Figure 1 shows that using acronyms in titles is more common in the biomedical domain

50



and a possible trend using acronyms at the beginning of the century. The lower figure in the middle
indicates an up and down over the years across impact factors. The right figures in Figure 1 tell us that
only a low percentage of authors use questions in their titles independent of domain or journal quality.

The numbers corroborate textbook literatures’ recommendation of using verbs in the titles as well as
using acronyms. A bit surprising is that questions in titles are rarely used, since according to literature
they create a mighty hook for the reader. In a next step we intend to relate the title to the content of the
abstract and the introduction to answer the question how well the title reflects the article’s content.

3.1.2 Figures & Tables
Visual representations of results in terms of figures and partly of tables help the reader to reduce reading
time. According to (Lebrun, 2007) they even represent visual information burgers which are easy to
digest. Figure 2 contains respective average figure and table counts.

Figure 2: Illustration of average figure and table counts over a ten-year period according to domain (left)
and impact factor (middle, right). The y-axis represents the average number of tables/figures per article.

The left figure in Figure 2 illustrates that authors from the biomedical domain use more tables and
figures than authors from the physics/computer science domain. The middle and right figure reflect
average counts according to impact factor. Journal articles with a high impact factor contain (i) fewer
tables than journals with middle or low impact factors and (ii) in general more figures.

From the results in Figure 2 we learn that usage of figures and tables appears to a certain degree
be dependent on the domain. In biomedicine, the usage of figures to convey information seems more
widespread than in technical domains. We assume even higher figure counts in domains such as chem-
istry where illustrations, for instance, of molecules are far more frequent. In addition, it seems that
authors of high impact journals prefer using figures to using tables probably because the information
content is more easily to grasp. Tables appear to be more suited to structure information. In a next step
we also intend to analyze figures’ and tables’ captions with respect to comprehensiveness, i.e. to what
extent are captions self-contained?

3.1.3 Lively Writing Style
Textbook literature advices authors to formulate their contributions in an active way using active voice
and the present tense. To learn more about present tense usage, we simply counted the occurrences of
the respective part-of-speech tags9, i.e. VB, VBP and VBZ. To count occurrences of active voice, we
inspected all identified verb chunks whether they contained auxiliary verbs as well as a past participle
part-of-speech tag. If they did, we considered them passive voice otherwise active voice. Figure 3
contains average fractions of verb phrases with respect to present tense and active voice.

The upper left figure in Figure 3 illustrates that authors of the physics/computer science domain use a
lot more present tense compared to authors from the biomedical domain. The upper right figure indicates
that the higher the journal’s impact factor the more present tense is used by the authors. The lower left
figure indicates that active and passive voice are almost evently distributed throughout article contents
with a bit passive predominance. The lower right figure shows no significant difference of using active
voice with respect to journal quality. There is but a trend towards using more active voice over the years.

Figure 3: Illustration of average fractions of verb phrases with respect to present tense (upper figures) and
active voice (lower figures) over a ten-year period. The left figures correspond to analyses with respect
to domain and the right ones to analyses with respect to impact factor.

The observed high percentage of present tense and active voice verb phrases adheres to the textbook
principle of lively stating one’s own work. Yet, in this analysis we took into account the tense and the
voice for the entire article content. To address this issue in greater depth, we intend to solely analyze
abstract, introduction and conclusion in the near future.

3.2 Imprecision

In this section we examine indicators of scientific imprecision according to textbook literature including
(i) number of citation bunches and (ii) number of relativating words.

3.2.1 Citation Bunches

Statements such as “many people have been working in this research area” + a sequence of citations in-
dicate lack of precision or insufficient dealing with the subject matter. We define a collection containing
more than 3 citations as citation bunch. Figure 4 contains average numbers of citation bunches per article.

The left figure in Figure 4 indicates that citation bunches occur more often in the biomedical domain
than in the physics/computer science domain. The right figure shows that citation bunches occur far more
often in journals with a low impact factor than in those with a middle or high one.

The findings indicate that journals with a higher impact factor contain fewer citation bunches - one
indicator of lack of precision. Concerning the higher numbers in the biomedical domain we intend to
examine the type of scientific articles in the future; for instance, we assume that survey articles contain
more citation bunches than others.

(right)) over a ten-year period. The y-axis corresponds to the average number of citation bunches (>3
citations) per scientific article.

3.2.2 Usage of Relativating Words
Overusage of relativating words10 indicates lack of precision. Reviewers may doubt an author’s expertise
and assurance of results if relativating words occur too frequently. Figure 5 contains average numbers of
relativating words per article sentence.

Figure 5: Illustration of relativating words usage by domain (left) and by impact factor (right). The y-axis
represents the average number of relativating words per article sentence.

The left figure in Figure 5 shows that more relativating words are used in the biomedical domain than
in the physics/computer science domain. In the right figure journals with a high and a middle-ranged
impact factor exhibit fewer relativating words than journals with a low impact factor.

The higher usage of relativating words in the biomedical domain remains unclear and might be due
to domain characteristics. Regarding the journal quality a similar behavior as in Section 3.2.1 can be
observed: higher quality journals contain fewer relativating words - an indication for a higher scientific
preciseness and quality.

4 Related Work

The analysis of academic writing originates from research areas such as linguistics and pragmatics.
These areas are rather interested in studying how scientific articles are written instead of what kind of
knowledge they contain.

Discourse Analysis is a modern discipline that studies amongst other things language beyond the
level of a sentence taking into account the surrounding contexts as well. The detection of discourse
structure in scientific documents is important for a number of tasks such as information extraction or text

10According to (Lebrun, 2007) relativating words include significantly, typically, generally, commonly, may/can, a number
of, the majority of, substantial, probably, several, less, various, frequent, many, others, more, often, most, a few, the main.

summarization. Elements of discourse include the statement of facts, claims and hypotheses as well as the
identification of methods and protocols. In this context (Liakata et al., 2012) automate the recognition of
11 categories including Hypothesis, Motivation and Result to access the scientific discourse of scientific
articles. In the Partridge system, (Ravenscroft et al., 2013) build upon the automated recognition to
automatically categorize articles according to their types such as Review or Case Study. (Teufel et al.,
2002) used discourse analysis to summarize scientific papers. She restored the discourse context by
adding the rhetorical status, for example, the scientific goal or criticism, to each sentence in an article.
In a similar way, (Liakata et al., 2013) take scientific discourse into account to generate a content model
for summarization purposes.

Besides analyzing the structure and organisation of entire publications (cf. (Paltridge, 2002)), there
is related literature dedicated to the analysis of single (structural) elements including (i) the title or (ii)
citations. The title is of particular importance often representing the first point of contact with the reader.
(Haggan, 2003) investigated whether titles of scientific articles could be regarded as headlines with a
clear role of informing and engaging the reader. In her work she pointed out the relation between title
formulation and information advertisement. (Soler, 2007) conducted title studies in two genres (review
and research papers) and in two fields (biological and social sciences). She statistically analyzed titles
with respect to word count, word frequency and title construction.

Citation analysis represents one of the most widely used methods of bibliometrics which aims to quan-
titatively analyze academic literature. Citation analysis (cf. (Garfield, 1979)) is an expression for simply
counting a scientific article’s citations which can be regarded as indicator for an article’s scientific im-
pact; the more often the article is cited, the higher its academic value (cf. (Garfield, 1972)). An important
part of citation analysis represents hedge detection (cf. (Lakoff, 1972)). Hedges are linguistic devices
which indicate that authors do not or cannot back up their statements with facts. Hedge detection, thus,
supports the distinction between facts and unreliable or uncertain information (cf. (Crompton, 1997)).
Facing the continuously growing amounts of scientific articles there has been an increased interest in
automating the process (cf. (Di Marco, 2006), (Farkas et al., 2007)).

5 Conclusion

Our paper’s contribution encompasses a comparison of theoretical guidelines, i.e. “What the literature
recommends?” with their practical implementations, i.e. “How authors actually write scientific arti-
cles?”. We designed a framework to automatically analyze ∼14.000 scientific articles with respect to a
selected set of writing principles.

To summarize the results: Section 3.2 shows a clear relation between journal quality and imprecision,
i.e. journals with low impact factors exhibit higher numbers of imprecision indicators such as number of
citation bunches and number of relativating words. In addition, the number of figures and the percentage
of verb phrases in present tense tend to be higher with higher quality journals (see Section 3.1).

In respect to the domain, the results indicate writing style preferences probably due to domain char-
acteristics, for instance, usage of more figures (see Section 3.1.2) and domain preferences, for instance,
lesser usage of present tense (see Section 3.1.3).

Other interesting observations include (i) that adhering to writing principles appears to be gender
independent and (ii) that using acronyms in titles is far more popular than using questions in the title (see
Section 3.1.1) independent of domain and impact factor.

Our findings show that theoretical guidelines partly concur with practical implementations and thus
contribute to better understand the extent to which theory guides praxis. A better understanding will
contribute (i) to confirm textbook principles and (ii) to update writing principles due to good practice.
In a next step we plan to extend the scale of our analyses to include several hundred thousand scientific
articles as well as the complexity of our analyses to investigate issues including (i) paper skeleton, for
instance, “Is there a prefered heading structure?” and (ii) usage of synonyms which hampers clarity.
