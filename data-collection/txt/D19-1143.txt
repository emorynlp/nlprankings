Abstract
Despite impressive empirical successes
of neural machine translation (NMT) on
standard benchmarks, limited parallel data
impedes the application of NMT models to
many language pairs. Data augmentation
methods such as back-translation make it
possible to use monolingual data to help
alleviate these issues, but back-translation
itself fails in extreme low-resource sce-
narios, especially for syntactically diver-
gent languages. In this paper, we propose
a simple yet effective solution, whereby
target-language sentences are re-ordered
to match the order of the source and
used as an additional source of training-
time supervision. Experiments with sim-
ulated low-resource Japanese-to-English,
and real low-resource Uyghur-to-English
scenarios find significant improvements
over other semi-supervised alternatives1

1 Introduction

While neural machine translation (NMT; Bah-
danau et al. (2015); Vaswani et al. (2017)) now
represents the state of the art in the majority of
large-scale MT benchmarks (Bojar et al., 2017), it
is highly dependent on the availability of copious
parallel resources; NMT under-performs previ-
ous phrase-based methods when the training data
is small (Koehn and Knowles, 2017). Unfortu-
nately, million-sentence parallel corpora are of-
ten unavailable for many language pairs. Con-
versely, monolingual sentences, particularly in En-
glish, are often much easier to find, making semi-
supervised approaches that can use monolingual
data a desirable solution to this problem.2

Semi-supervised approaches for NMT are of-
ten based on automatically creating pseudo-
parallel sentences through methods such as back-
translation (Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013; Sen-
nrich et al., 2016) or adding an auxiliary auto-
encoding task on monolingual data (Cheng et al.,
2016; He et al., 2016; Currey et al., 2017). How-
ever, both methods have problems with low-
resource and syntactically divergent language
pairs. Back translation assumes enough data to
create a functional NMT system, an unrealistic re-
quirement in low-resource scenarios, while auto-
encoding target sentences by definition will not be
able to learn source-target word reordering.

This paper proposes a method to create pseudo-
parallel sentences for NMT for language pairs
with divergent syntactic structures. Prior to NMT,
word reordering was a major challenge for statis-
tical machine translation (SMT), and many tech-
niques have emerged over the years to address
this challenge (Xia and McCord, 2004; Bisazza
and Federico, 2016). Importantly, even simple
heuristic reordering methods with a few hand-
created rules have been shown to be highly effec-
tive in closing syntactic gaps (Collins et al. (2005);
Isozaki et al. (2010b); Fig. 1). Because these
rules usually function solely in high-resourced
languages such as English with high-quality syn-

guages, but limited success on real low-resource settings and
syntactically divergent language pairs (Neubig and Hu, 2018;
Guzmán et al., 2019). Hence we focus on semi-supervised
methods in this paper.

tactic analysis tools, a linguist with rudimentary
knowledge of the structure of the target language
can create them in short order using these tools.

However, similar pre-ordering methods have
not proven useful in NMT (Du and Way, 2017),
largely because high-resource scenarios NMT is
much more effective at learning reordering than
previous SMT methods were (Bentivogli et al.,
2016). However, in low-resource scenarios it is
less realistic to expect that NMT could learn this
reordering from scratch on its own.

Here we ask “how can we efficiently leverage
the monolingual target data to improve the perfor-
mance of the NMT system in low-resource, syn-
tactically divergent language pairs?” We tackle
this problem via a simple two-step data augmenta-
tion method: (1) we first reorder monolingual tar-
get sentences to create source-ordered target sen-
tences as shown in Fig. 1, (2) we then replace
the words in the reordered sentences with source
words using a bilingual dictionary, and add them
as the source side of a pseudo-parallel corpus. Ex-
periments demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-
proach on translation from Japanese and Uyghur
to English, with a simple, linguistically motivated
method of head finalization (HF; Isozaki et al.
(2010b)) as our reordering method.

2 The Proposed Method

Training Framework We assume that there are
two types of available resources: a small parallel
corpus P = {(s, t)} and a large monolingual tar-
get corpus Q. The goal of our method is to create a
pseudo-parallel corpus Q̂ = {(ŝ, t)}, where ŝ is a
pseudo-parallel sentence automatically created in
two steps of (1) word reordering, and (2) word-by-
word translation.

Word Reordering The first step reorders mono-
lingual target sentences t ∈ Q into the source or-
der ts. Instead of devising an entirely new word-
ordering method, we can simply rely on methods
that have already been widely studied and proven
useful in SMT (Bisazza and Federico, 2016). Re-
ordering can be done either using rules based
on linguistic knowledge (Isozaki et al., 2010b;
Collins et al., 2005) or learning from aligned
parallel data (Xia and McCord, 2004; Habash,
2007), and in principle our pseudo-corpus creation
paradigm is compatible with any of these methods.

Specifically, in this work we utilize rule-based
methods, as our goal is to improve translation of

low-resource languages, where large quantities of
high-quality parallel data do not exist and we posit
that current data-driven reordering methods are
unlikely to function well. Examples of rule-based
methods include those to reorder English into Ger-
man (Navratil et al., 2012), Arabic (Badr et al.,
2009), or Japanese (Isozaki et al., 2010b). In ex-
periments we use Isozaki et al. (2010b)’s method
of reordering SVO languages (e.g. English) into
the order of SOV languages (e.g. Japanese) by
simply (1) applying a syntactic parser to English
(Tsuruoka et al., 2004), (2) identifying the head
constituent of each phrase and moving it to the
end of the phrase, and (3) inserting special tokens
after subjects and objects of predicates to mimic
Japanese case markers.

Word-by-word Translation To generate data
for training MT models, we next perform word-
by-word translation of ts into pseudo-source sen-
tence ŝ using a bilingual dictionary (Xie et al.,
2018).3 There are many ways we can obtain this
dictionary: even for many low-resource languages
with a paucity of bilingual text, we can obtain
manually-curated lexicons with reasonable cover-
age, or run unsupervised word alignment on what-
ever parallel data we have available. In addition,
we can induce word translations for more words
in target language using methods for bilingual lex-
icon induction over pre-trained word embeddings
(e.g. Grave et al. (2018)).

3 Experiments

We evaluate our method on two language pairs:
Japanese-to-English (ja-en) and Uyghur-to-
English (ug-en). Japanese and Uyghur are phy-
logenetically distant languages, but they share
similar SOV syntactic structure, which is greatly
divergent from English SVO structure.

3.1 Experimental Setup

For both language pairs, we use an attention-
based encoder-decoder NMT model with a one-
layer bidirectional LSTM as the encoder and one-
layer uni-directional LSTM as the decoder.4 Em-
beddings and LSTM states were set to 300 and

3We also performed extensive preliminary experiments
that learned bilingual word embeddings a-priori and froze
them when training the NMT model, or continued to align
the bilingual word embedding space during NMT training,
but the word-by-word translation approach worked best.

4We experimented with small Transformers (Vaswani
et al., 2017) but they under-performed LSTM-based models.

256 dimensions respectively. Target word embed-
dings are shared with the softmax weight matrix in
the decoder. As noted above, we use HF (Isozaki
et al., 2010b) as our re-ordering rule. HF was de-
signed for transforming English into Japanese or-
der, but we use it as-is for the Uyghur-English pair
as well to demonstrate that simple, linguistically
motivated rules can generalize across pairs with
similar syntax with little or no modification. Fur-
ther details regarding the experimental settings are
in the supplementary material.

Simulated Japanese to English Experiments
We first evaluate on a simulated low-resource
ja-en translation task using the ASPEC
dataset (Nakazawa et al., 2016). We randomly
select 400k ja-en parallel sentence pairs to
use as our full training data. We then randomly
sub-sample low-resource datasets of 3k, 6k,
10k, and 20k parallel sentences, and use the
remainder of the 400k English sentences as
monolingual data. We duplicate the number of
parallel sentences by 5 times in the training data
augmented with the reordered pairs. For settings
with supervised parallel sentences of 3k, 6k, 10k
and 20k, we set the maximum vocabulary size of
both Japanese and English to be 10k, 10k, 15k
and 20k respectively.

To automatically learn a high-precision dictio-
nary on the small amount of parallel data we have
available for training, we use GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003) to learn alignments in both directions
then take the intersection of alignments. We then
learn the bilingual word embeddings with DeMa-
BWE (Zhou et al., 2019), an unsupervised method
that has shown strong results on syntactically di-
vergent language pairs. We give the more reliable
alignments extracted from GIZA++ high priority
by querying the alignment dictionary first, then
follow by querying the embedding-induced dictio-
nary. When an English word is not within any vo-
cabulary, we output the English word as-is into the
pseudo-source sentence.

Real Uyghur to English Experiments We also
consider the harder case of Uyghur, a truly low-
resource language. We create test and valida-
tion sets using the test data from the DARPA
LORELEI corpus (Christianson et al., 2018)
which contains 2,275 sentence pairs (after filter-
ing out noisy ones) related to incidents that hap-
pened in the Uyghur area. We hold out 300 pairs
as the validation data and use the rest as the test

set. The LORELEI language pack also contains
the bilingual lexicons between Uyghur and En-
glish, and thousands of in-domain English sen-
tences. We also use a large monolingual English
corpus containing sentences related to various in-
cidents occurring all over the world collected from
ReliefWeb.5 To sub-select a relevant subset of this
corpus, we use the cross-entropy filtering (Moore
and Lewis, 2010) to select 400k that are most like
the in-domain English data.

For parallel data, like many low-resource lan-
guages, we only have access to data from the
Bible6 and Wikipedia language links (the total
number of parallel Uyghur-English Wikipedia ti-
tles is 3,088), but no other in-domain parallel data.
We run GIZA++ on this parallel data to obtain
an alignment dictionary. We learn the bilingual
word embeddings via the supervised Geometric
approach (Jawanpuria et al., 2019) on FastText
(Grave et al., 2018) pre-trained Uyghur and En-
glish monolingual embeddings.

3.2 Results and Comparison

Baselines In Tab. 1, we compare our models
with baselines including regular supervised train-
ing (sup) and back-translation (Sennrich et al.,
2016) (back).7 To demonstrate the effective-
ness of the reordering, we also compare our
method against a copy-based data-augmentation
method (No-reorder) where the original English
sentences t ∈ Q rather than the reordered ones
ts are translated via the bilingual lexicon.8 For
each of the above settings, we also experimented
with a phrased-based statistical machine transla-
tion (SMT) system (Dyer et al., 2010). In Tab. 1,
we only show the results with supervised data and
back-translation for SMT, since we observed that
the data augmentation method performs poorly
with SMT (complete results are presented in the
Appendix).

Main Results In Tab. 1, we observe consis-
tent improvements on both ja-en and ug-en
translation tasks against other baseline methods.
First, comparing our results with the NMT mod-
els trained using the same amount of parallel data,
our word reordering-based semi-supervised mod-
els consistently outperform standard NMT models
by a large margin. In the case that we have no ac-
cess to in-domain parallel data at all, our method
can still achieve some success in ug-en transla-
tion. Second, comparing our Reorder method with
the No-Reorder one, reordering English sentences

7We also trained unsupervised NMT (Artetxe et al.,
2018b) on 400k Japanese and English sentences from the AS-
PEC corpus or monolingual Uyghur and English corpus pro-
vided in the LORELEI data package, and it achieved BLEU
of 0.6 and 0.0 respectively, corroborating previous results
noting the difficulty of unsupervised NMT for low-resource
scenarios (Neubig and Hu, 2018; Guzmán et al., 2019)

8This is similar to Currey et al. (2017) who simply copy
target-language sentences to the source. But in our experi-
ments, the source and target languages do not share the al-
phabet and thus we found translation necessary. This also
increases consistency with our “Reorder” experiments.

into the source language order consistently brings
large performance gains, which demonstrates the
importance of reordering. These results are no-
table given previous reports that explicit reorder-
ing is not beneficial for NMT (Du and Way, 2017).
Third, for ja-en translation, when gradually de-
creasing the amount of parallel data, the improve-
ments of our model over the supervised NMT
models become more significant, demonstrating
the effectiveness of our approach in low-resource
settings. Fourth, back-translation is not very ben-
eficial or even harmful, likely because the back-
translation system trained on limited supervised
data can not provide high-quality translations to
train the model. Finally, we also notice that al-
though SMT performs better than NMT with less
supervised training data (3k, 6k supervised data
and Uyghur), the performance gain is not as re-
markable as NMT when the amount of supervised
data increases. Moreover, in the case of less su-
pervised data, our data augmentation method with
reordering still outperforms SMT.

We give two examples of the translation outputs
of our model and a supervised NMT model for
ug-en and ja-en (trained with 6k supervised
pairs) in Tab. 2. In the first example from ja-en,
our model is able to output terminology such as
“rotation rate” thanks to the enlarged vocabulary
while the supervised model can not. In the exam-
ple from ug-en, our model can produce a more
fluent sentence with better information coverage.

Analysis To investigate the effects of reordering,
we compare our method with “No-Reorder" de-
scribed in 3.2. First, we bucket the test data by
sentence length and compute the BLEU score ac-
cordingly. We present the comparison results in
Fig. 2, from which we observe that “Reorder" out-
performs “No-Reorder" consistently under differ-
ent sentence length buckets, and the improvement
is larger when the sentence length is longer.

Second, we also evaluate the model outputs on
the test data with RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010a)
which is an automatic evaluation metric of trans-
lation quality designed for distant languages that
is especially sensitive to word order. From Fig. 3,
we can see that “Reorder" consistently outper-
forms “No-Reorder" on ja-en translation espe-
cially when the amount of supervised data de-
creases. This suggests that with reordered pairs
as the augmented training data, the model is able
to output more syntactically correct sentences.

4 Conclusion

This paper proposed a simple yet effective semi-
supervised learning framework for low-resource
machine translation that artificially creates source-
ordered target sentences for data-augmentation.
Experimental results on ja-en and ug-en trans-
lations show that our approach achieves significant
improvements over baseline systems, demonstrat-
ing the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
divergent language pairs.
